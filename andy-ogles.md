# Andy Ogles' Policies Have Harmed Everyday People

- [:angel: *Raised Money For A Stillborn Children’s Memorial That Was Never Built*](/andy-ogles/stillborn-burial-garden-gofundme) Ogles raised nearly $25,000 for a children’s burial garden that was never built and still has not clearly accounted for the money.
- [:baby_bottle: *Backed “Personhood” Bills That Threaten IVF And Birth Control*](/andy-ogles/personhood-ivf-contraception) Ogles cosponsored federal “personhood” bills that legal experts say could be used to restrict or even ban IVF and some forms of contraception.
- [:pill: *Backed Health Care Policies That Raise Costs And Cut Coverage*](/andy-ogles/health-care-record) Ogles has tried to repeal drug-cost caps and backed new Medicaid and ACA red tape that independent analysts say will leave millions more uninsured.
- [:hospital: *Supported Plans That Undermine Medicare And Raise Drug Prices For Seniors*](/andy-ogles/medicare-cuts) By pushing to repeal Medicare drug reforms and backing voucher-style plans, Ogles would raise costs and weaken guaranteed coverage for seniors.
- [:bank: *Backed Plans To Cut Social Security And Speed Up Insolvency*](/andy-ogles/social-security-cuts) Ogles backs Republican Study Committee plans to raise the retirement age and voted for a law that moves Social Security’s trust-fund shortfall even closer.
- [:shopping_cart: *Supported Tariffs And Repeal Of Drug Caps That Raise Cost Of Living*](/andy-ogles/cost-of-living-tariffs) He supports broad tariffs that raise prices on everyday goods while trying to roll back Medicare drug caps that save families and seniors money.
- [:no_entry_sign: *Cast A Deciding Vote To Take Medicaid From Millions*](/andy-ogles/medicaid-work-requirements) Ogles’ “yes” vote on a one-vote-margin bill wrote strict Medicaid work rules into law that CBO says will cause millions to lose coverage.
- [:factory: *Backed Shutdowns And Rollbacks That Threaten Tennessee Jobs*](/andy-ogles/jobs-tennessee) He has opposed bipartisan deals to keep the government open and backed rollbacks of infrastructure and clean-energy investments that support Tennessee jobs.

# Andy Ogles Used His Power To Benefit Himself And The Powerful

- [:file_folder: *Withheld A Deciding Vote To Block Immediate Release Of The Epstein Files*](/andy-ogles/epstein-files-vote) Ogles sat out a one-vote procedural fight that would have allowed an Epstein-files release amendment, then backed a weaker oversight-only alternative and refused to sign the near-complete discharge petition.
- [:briefcase: *Inflated His Résumé To Look Like An Economist And Crime-Fighting Expert*](/andy-ogles/resume-inflation) He repeatedly billed himself as an economist and international sex-crimes expert even though records show a liberal-studies degree, short certificate courses, and a brief reserve-deputy stint.
- [:rotating_light: *Misreported Campaign Finances And Drew An FBI Investigation*](/andy-ogles/campaign-finance-fbi) Ogles admitted a claimed $320,000 self-loan to his campaign wasn’t real, triggering watchdog complaints, a House Ethics review, and an FBI campaign-finance investigation that included a phone seizure.
