## Overview

Ciscomani stood by while Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” made cuts and reductions that affected the federal government’s ability to deliver services to seniors. [More than 232,000 Arizonans](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/az.pdf) in Ciscomani’s district relied on Social Security benefits. Ciscomani was even [“thrilled”](https://ciscomani.house.gov/media/press-releases/ciscomani-joins-doge-caucus-rein-wasteful-spending-and-make-government-more) to join the congressional DOGE caucus and claimed people needed to [trust Trump and his decisions](https://www.gvnews.com/free_access/q-a-ciscomani-looks-at-trumps-first-four-weeks/article_9150683a-f008-11ef-bb2f-abdfeb76f9dd.html). 

## Ciscomani Was A Rubber Stamp For Trump And DOGE’s Harmful Agenda

### January 2025: Ciscomani Joined the Congressional Doge Caucus

**January 2025: Ciscomani Said He Was Proud To Join The DOGE Caucus To Rein In Wasteful Spending And Put America Back On The Track Of Fiscal Responsibility.** According to an op-ed by Juan Ciscomani in the Washington Reporter, "This is why, as Arizona’s sole House appropriator, I was proud to join the Delivering Outstanding Government Efficiency (DOGE) Caucus to work closely with President Donald Trump’s newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to rein in wasteful spending, streamline bloated government bureaucracies, and put America back on the path of fiscal responsibility." \[Juan Ciscomani Op-Ed, Washington Reporter, [1/24/25](https://washingtonreporter.news/p/op-ed-rep-juan-ciscomani-our-national)\]

-   **12/6/24: Ciscomani Said He Was “Thrilled” To Join The DOGE Caucus.** According to a press release from Rep. Juan Ciscomani, "‘The United States’ national debt recently surpassed $36 trillion and is becoming increasingly unsustainable every day, risking our nation’s fiscal stability,’ said Ciscomani. ‘This is why I am thrilled to join the DOGE Caucus to work closely with President-elect Trump’s newly formed Department of Government Efficiency to reduce waste, cut unnecessary red-tape, streamline bloated government bureaucracies, safeguard taxpayer dollars, and put America back on the path of fiscal responsibility.’" \[Press Release – Rep. Juan Ciscomani, [12/6/24](https://ciscomani.house.gov/media/press-releases/ciscomani-joins-doge-caucus-rein-wasteful-spending-and-make-government-more)\]

**Ciscomani Said His Approach To DOGE Cuts Was To Tackle Waste, Fraud, And Abuse And Root Out Outdated Programs In The Federal Government.** According to the Tucson Sentinel, "Ciscomani, a member of the new DOGE Caucus in the House of Representatives, met with Musk on Dec. 5 alongside House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republican lawmakers. Ciscomani said Monday his approach to the DOGE effort ‘is to make sure that government spending is being held accountable and that we can tackle and identify the waste, the fraud, the abuse within the government that is not reaching its intended purpose. And when you do that, you're going to find areas that don't need this funding anymore. You're gonna find programs that are not meeting their standards, programs that are outdated and no longer necessary.’" \[Tucson Sentinel, [2/18/25](https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/021825_cisco_town_hall/ciscomani-praises-doge-work-while-protestors-warn-that-us-sliding-into-fascism/)\]

### DOGE Cuts Created Chaos and Resulted in Layoffs in Arizona

**There Were Roughly 15,000 Federal Workers In Ciscomani’s District.** According to the Kentucky Lantern, "There are also thousands of federal employees spread throughout the 18 House districts identified as toss-up races by The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.  The eight GOP-held House seats that could swing to Democrats following the 2026 midterms include Arizona’s 6th Congressional District, currently represented by Rep. Juan Ciscomani and home to about 15,000 federal workers." \[Kentucky Lantern, [2/18/25](https://kentuckylantern.com/2025/02/18/repub/republicans-worry-gop-led-states-will-suffer-from-trumps-firings-of-federal-workers/)\]

**The Trump Administration Laid Off 1,400 Workers At The Department Of Veterans Affairs Which Included Therapists And Mental Health Professionals In Arizona.** According to the Arizona Republic, "The Trump administration laid off 1,400 workers at the Department of Veteran Affairs across the country, bringing the total firings at the agency to 2,400 workers in the past month. The terminated employees held ‘non-mission critical positions,’ the VA said in a news release. \[…\] Taylor Hernandez, a 23-year-old recreation therapist at the VA, was fired in the same way and has also appealed the decision. She warned the Community Living Center unit where she worked would no longer meet the therapist-to-veteran ratio standard and the remaining therapist would likely be overwhelmed with work. The Department of Veterans Affairs did not say how many employees were laid off in Arizona, but Hernandez said the cuts here included other therapists and mental health professionals." \[Arizona Republic, [2/27/25](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/02/27/trumps-doge-firings-hit-phoenix-va-therapists/80570579007/)\]

**Ten Staffers Were Fired At The Arizona Rural Development Office, Which Was An Arm Of The U.S. Department Of Agriculture.** According to the Arizona Republic, "Ten staffers were fired from Arizona’s rural development office last month, an organization that oversees government loans for rural public works projects. It’s a significant cut to the office, which a former employee said employed 30 to 40 people. The office is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The massive agency employs 100,000 people across the nation. It’s not clear how many USDA employees have been fired from their jobs this year." \[Arizona Republic, [2/27/25](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/02/27/trumps-doge-firings-hit-phoenix-va-therapists/80570579007/)\]
