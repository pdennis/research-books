# **How To Win Against Tom Kean Jr.**

Multimillionaire Tom Kean, Jr. is a flip-flopper who will say and do anything to get elected and please his Republican party leaders. He voted to take Medicaid benefits and food assistance away from his constituents. He backed Trump’s unpopular tariffs despite the harm it was bringing to New Jerseyans. He criticized his opponent for violating the STOCK Act and swore to put his stocks in a blind trust, then after getting elected he violated the STOCK Act and failed to put his stocks in a blind trust. He was silent when DOGE threatened thousands of his constituents’ jobs and benefits. New Jerseyans can’t count on Tom Kean, Jr. to fight for them, all he can provide is an [awkwardly silent elevator ride](https://x.com/benhulac/status/1838962877132165566?s=20). 

### Kean Voted To Gut Health Care Benefits For New Jerseyans

-   After [promising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCPLg51_eSc) to protect Medicaid, Kean [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that would kick [17 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including [nearly 12 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off of Medicaid. Kean even [sits on the committee](https://kean.house.gov/media/press-releases/kean-selected-serve-energy-and-commerce-committee-119th-congress) that was tasked with writing the Medicaid cuts. [More than 20,000 New Jerseyans](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) in his district could lose their health coverage as a result of his vote.
-   Kean previously said he disagreed with the Affordable Care Act, which [enabled Medicaid expansion](https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/medicaid-expansion-frequently-asked-questions-0) to cover more New Jerseyans. More than [513,000 New Jerseyans](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/marketplace-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=0&selectedRows=%7B%22states%22:%7B%22new-jersey%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) were enrolled in an Affordable Care Act insurance plan in 2025. 

**Message:** Kean broke his promise to protect Medicaid and voted to rip away health care from thousands of New Jerseyans to fund billionaire tax cuts. 

### Kean Voted For Massive Cuts To Medicare

-   Kean [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml) for a bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would result in [nearly $500 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare, absent future congressional action. 

**Message:** Kean voted to cut health care services seniors rely on all to give tax breaks to billionaires. 

### Kean Voted To Take Away Critical Food Assistance For New Jerseyans

-   Kean [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a Republican budget bill that constituted the [“largest cut to SNAP in history.”](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-senate-republican-leaderships-reconciliation-bill-takes) [More than 10,000 people in NJ-07](https://www.fns.usda.gov/data-research/data-visualization/snap-community-characteristics-congressional-district-dashboard) relied on SNAP benefits to be able to afford groceries.

**Message:** Kean voted to take food assistance from his constituents all to fund billionaire tax cuts.

### **Kean Was The Deciding Vote To Protect Trump's “Business-Busting” Tariffs**

-   Kean believed it was [“very important”](https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/mind-bogglingly-stupid-or-a-great-negotiator-n-j-delegation-tries-to-keep-up-with-trumps-tariff-rollercoaster/) for Trump to have done tariffs the way that he has and defended the use of tariffs as a [“great negotiating tool.”](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/tom-kean-jr-tele-town-hall-712025/s-utwoMpqzCPF?si=aec18e358d77473abaf453b33bf7eb9d&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)
-   Then, he voted four times to protect the tariffs, including in April 2025 when he was the [deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect them, dooming New Jersey families who relied on him to a _trade war_ and rising prices. Tariffs are contributing to [higher food prices](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi) and causing North Jersey businesses to [raise prices](https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/business/2025/06/04/nj-businesses-raised-prices-trump-tariffs/84027265007/), and were described by one New Jersey entrepreneur as [“business-busting.”](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/new-jersey-rinseroo-tariffs-lisa-lane/)

**Message:** Kean thinks Trump’s tariffs are a “great negotiating tool,” but they mean higher prices and harder times for New Jersey families and businesses.  

### **Kean Talked Tough On SALT, But Came Up Short**

-   As [_vice-chair of the congressional SALT caucus_](https://www.newjerseyhills.com/bernardsville_news/news/rep-kean-discusses-his-priorities-for-119th-congress-in-interview-with-new-jersey-hills-media/article_4dc163d0-ea6d-11ef-bc2d-03b261f8def7.html), Kean promised he would fight to [_fully restore_](https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/an-interview-with-tom-kean-jr/) the SALT deduction, but it was all posturing. Kean came up short with only a [_temporary_](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/how-would-the-2025-house-tax-bill-change-the-salt-deduction/) $40,000 deduction and faced [_criticism_](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-jersey-playbook/2025/07/02/trump-nominates-habba-for-full-term-00436826) for not fighting harder for a full restoration.

**Message:** Kean promised he would fully restore tax relief for New Jerseyans, but came up short. 

### **No-Show Kean Won't Stand Up For His Constituents**

-   Kean has a reputation for hiding from reporters and his constituents. He often stays [quiet](https://www.insidernj.com/press-release/tom-kean-jr-hides-from-workers-as-fellow-house-republican-faces-viral-backlash-for-gop-agenda-of-ripping-jobs-away-cutting-health-care/) on the issues that matter most to his constituents, such as health care. 
- Kean [has](https://www.insidernj.com/kean-phones-in-townhall-with-no-live-questions/) [stood by](https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2025/03/elon-musk-super-pac-america-pac-spent-1m-helping-republican-congressman-tom-kean-jr-reelected/) while Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” destroyed services New Jerseyans rely on, calling the effort a [“necessary step.”](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/tom-kean-jr-tele-town-hall-3262025/s-9J9ZUVNS93v?si=6cbe7cb10075463b840a752919eac639&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) Meanwhile, DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) ability to [deliver services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) to seniors. [More than 152,000 New Jerseyans](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/nj.pdf) in Kean’s district relied on Social Security benefits. 

**Message:** When retirees and disabled New Jerseyans needed help, Kean protected himself and his party, not his constituents. 
 

### **Kean Broke His Promises On Stock Trading And Ethics**

-   Back in 2022, Kean campaigned on banning Members of Congress from stock trading and relentlessly attacked his opponent for violating the STOCK Act. But when Kean got elected he was [_more of the same_](https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/07/wealthy-nj-congressman-promised-saintly-ethics-he-chose-getting-richer-instead-rivals-say.html). He [_hasn’t stopped_](https://americanjournalnews.com/new-jersey-rep-tom-kean-jr-s-stock-trades-continue-to-draw-scrutiny/) trading stocks, violated the STOCK Act [_more_](https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/kean-self-reports-stock-trades-left-off-earlier-reports/) [_than once_](https://www.rawstory.com/congress-stock/), and has [_yet to put his assets in a blind trust_](https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/07/wealthy-nj-congressman-promised-saintly-ethics-he-chose-getting-richer-instead-rivals-say.html) despite promising constituents that he would.

**Message:** Kean promised he would be different, but he’s just another DC politician playing the market, breaking his promises, and putting himself above the rules. 

### It Took Kean 11 Months To Vote To Release The Epstein Files And He Did Only After Trump Gave Republicans Permission

- Kean has claimed in the past that he was an advocate for greater government transparency and accountability, but it took him 11 months to vote to releasing the Epstein files. In November 2025, Kean finally [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml) to release the Epstein files, but only after [Donald Trump gave House Republicans permission](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115562626931599548) to do so. Previously, Kean had [cast the deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml) against [releasing the Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj), protecting the accused pedophiles named within them. Kean also never [signed](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209) the discharge petition that called for their release and he never [co-sponsored](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581/cosponsors?pageSort=alphaByParty) Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna’s resolution calling for their release. 

**Message:** Kean claimed to be an advocate for more government transparency and accountability, but it took him 11 months to vote to release the Epstein files and he did only after Trump gave Republicans permission.
