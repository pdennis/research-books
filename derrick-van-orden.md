# **How To Win Against Derrick Van Orden**

Derrick Van Orden has been a headache for the district. He backed ripping health care from thousands of Wisconsinites, defended Trump’s tariffs as they rattled farm country, cheered on cuts and chaos that slowed Social Security and squeezed agricultural programs, and he can’t control his temper—from the Prairie du Chien library blow-up to berating teen Senate pages to shouting down witnesses in committee. He was also photographed near Capitol grounds on January 6th. La Crosse, Eau Claire, and rural Wisconsin communities deserve sober leadership, not bar-fight politics. 

### **VAN ORDEN VOTED FOR DEVASTATING HEALTH CARE CUTS after promising he wouldn't**

-   Van Orden promised that he could not cut Medicaid and that Americans would not see [_“a single nickel reduction”_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8LISRGHpcs&list=PLWuvMonaruUimi7u8uNYdlKyfYpbR1AHu&index=8) in their benefits. Then, he [_voted_](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that would kick [_17 million Americans_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including nearly [_12 million Americans_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off of Medicaid. More than [_32,000 Wisconsinites_](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) could lose their health coverage as a result of his votes. Van Orden also put [_rural hospitals_](https://www.wpr.org/news/rural-hospitals-midwest-medicaid-changes) like [_MCHS Oakridge_](https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_on_rural_hospitals.pdf) [_at risk_](https://upnorthnewswi.com/2025/08/08/rural-health-care-death-spiral-gop-medicaid-cuts/).

- Van Orden claimed Americans would not see a “single nickel reduction” in their Medicare benefits as a result of Republicans' budget bill. Then, he [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml) for a bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would result in [nearly $500 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare, absent future congressional action. 

**Message:** Van Orden voted to drain our safety net and leave Wisconsinites with a hangover. 

### **VAN ORDEN WAS THE DECIDING VOTE TO PROTECT TRUMP’S TARIFFS THAT WERE CRUSHING WISCONSIN FARMERS**

-   Despite acknowledging that tariffs were [_“going to be painful”_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SmeIwEkBYo) for Wisconsinites, Van Orden not only [_defended_](https://www.wizmnews.com/2025/05/22/rep-van-orden-speaks-on-snap-vote-and-how-farmers-could-benefit-from-tariffs/) the tariffs, but [_threatened_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SmeIwEkBYo) other countries and told them to get in line with the trade war or Trump would destroy them. He even [_taunted_](https://www.wispolitics.com/2025/baldwin-calls-trump-tariffs-bad-news-while-gop-house-members-express-support/) a Canadian premier after he announced retaliatory tariffs on the U.S.
-   Then, he voted four times to protect the tariffs, including in April 2025 when he was the [_deciding vote_](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect them, dooming Wisconsin families who relied on him to a [_trade war_](https://wisconsinagconnection.com/news/wisconsin-soybean-farmers-hit-hard-by-new-us-tariffs?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and rising prices. Tariffs are contributing to [_higher food prices_](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi) and [_causing_](https://barnraisingmedia.com/farmer-cost-of-trump-tariffs-wisconsin/) [_problems_](https://www.wisn.com/article/a-whole-lot-of-uncertainty-tariffs-take-a-toll-on-wisconsin-farmers/64425479) for Wisconsin farmers.
-   As a result of Trump’s trade war, China had [_stopped buying Americans soybeans_](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/business/china-us-soybeans-farming.html) and instead [_started buying them from Brazil_](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-misses-out-billions-dollars-china-soybean-sales-midway-through-peak-season-2025-09-10/). China had previously been the [_biggest buyer_](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/the-american-farmers-china-is-using-as-a-trade-war-bargaining-chip-134c2cda?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAim6K_ctW7ArWM9H6fc_WMa3BuzkmnO1jk_Gc3V0CbMeWyyd1kdeiVJGKHZ73M%3D&gaa_ts=68cc4400&gaa_sig=a7zuiQ_nXRNWx5AM9EsmgKrpRrZEa7Quu2sP9yd5RR5WSyKuJld_wSYsuOip6gkZwbwixDT4bJjsGn-_hMlecQ%3D%3D) of American soybeans.

**Message:** Van Orden has been toasting trade wars while Wisconsin farmers pick up the tab.   
 

### **VAN ORDEN CHEERED AS SOCIAL SECURITY, FARMERS, AND VETERANS SUFFERED**

-   Van Orden supported the [_“tumultuous”_](https://www.wpr.org/news/contentious-wisconsin-republicans-virtual-town-halls-van-orden) nature of DOGE, at one point saying he [_“would rather shake the tree than water the tree with the blood of liberty.”_](https://www.wpr.org/news/contentious-wisconsin-republicans-virtual-town-halls-van-orden) He even joined the congressional DOGE caucus. Meanwhile, DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [_affecting_](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [_federal government’s_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) [_ability_](https://www.tmj4.com/news/milwaukee-county/some-milwaukee-residents-say-theyre-already-struggling-for-assistance-as-social-security-faces-cuts) to [_deliver services_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. More than [_180,000 Wisconsinites_](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/wi.pdf) in Van Orden’s district rely on Social Security benefits.
-   He defended DOGE even though an Athens, WI farmer [_said_](https://www.wpr.org/news/wisconsins-growing-season-arriving-with-uncertainty-amid-usda-cuts-tariffs) cuts to federal agricultural programs were affecting her bottom line.
-   Van Orden also [_defended_](https://x.com/derrickvanorden/status/1895079158855922175) Trump’s mass layoffs of federal workers, even going so far as to [_bully_](https://www.wkow.com/news/he-bullied-me-congressman-derrick-van-orden-threatens-to-report-veteran-former-va-employee-to/article_a66c3252-fa27-11ef-b4fe-eb7522e30aa2.html) and [_threaten_](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/05/wisconsin-rep-derrick-van-orden-threatens-already-fired-va-employee/81369971007/) a veteran who had been fired who messaged Van Orden on LinkedIn asking him to help stop the firings.

**Message:** Van Orden toasted to cuts that hurt seniors, farmers, and veterans and called it efficiency instead of keeping lines open and the checks on-time.    
 

### **DERRICK VAN ORDEN: CONDUCT UNBECOMING A CONGRESSMAN**

-   Van Orden has not demonstrated the appropriate temperament for a congressman. His anger problems have been widely reported on, tracing back to his first run for Congress when he [_yelled_](https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-michael-pence-5cab54183ad8668ddcc78515d06adaa6) at a teenager working as a library page because he was offended by a pride month book display.
-   During his first term in congress, Van Orden [_berated_](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-lawmaker-screamed-curse-words-inches-senate-pages-faces-source-say-rcna97157) a group of 16 and 17-year-old Senate pages and [_shouted_](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-leaders-rebuke-rep-derrick-van-orden-after/story?id=101765606) curse words at them in the Capitol rotunda.
-   Most recently, he [_shouted at and belittled_](https://upnorthnewswi.com/2025/04/09/derrick-van-orden-screams-at-a-witness-while-defending-cuts-to-food-aid/) a witness testifying in Congress about food assistance programs, and [_posted a photo_](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/06/derrick-van-orden-escalates-mark-pocan-feud-with-post-of-a-naked-man/85545882007/) of a naked man wearing a ski mask and holding a sex toy as part of a feud with another congressman.

**Message:** Wisconsinites ordered serious, competent leadership, not another round of embarrassing bar-stool blowups.

### it took Van oRden 11 months to vote to release the epstein files and he did only after trump gave republicans permission

-   In November 2025, after 11 months, Van Orden finally [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml) to release the Epstein files, but only after [Donald Trump gave House Republicans permission](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115562626931599548) to do so. Van Orden said he wanted [“every bit of evidence concerning Epstein”](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/16/ron-johnson-wisconsin-republicans-call-for-transparency-on-epstein/85246725007/) to be released, but then [criticized](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/22/democrats-epstein-attack-plans-00468534) people for making the release of the files a priority. In July, Van Orden had [cast the deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml) against [releasing the Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj), protecting the accused pedophiles named within them. Van Orden also never [signed](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209) the discharge petition that called for their release and he never [co-sponsored](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581/cosponsors?pageSort=alphaByParty) Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna’s resolution calling for their release. He also [claimed](https://www.wxow.com/news/wisconsin-politics/rep-van-orden-says-sexual-assault-perpetuators-should-be-executed-calls-trump-note-to-epstein/article_c724a3b0-6952-4f20-810b-7f33104de67b.html) the [letter](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/epstein-birthday-book-congress-9d79ab34?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAg7dZYKirUZQWNf_S6l836nhLeDsi8LAXVom7v-rac84COKmnxUF7KKp1duwSo%3D&gaa_ts=68c19d8a&gaa_sig=7Lj4Q5HFi2PeQGOaMQG1ytVDrXqgT1e4gUWkSTWcp8zY2FBDzEcVPR5reowOmUcmZMORNvQe0moSrOxJQapY4g%3D%3D) Trump sent Jeffrey Epstein for his 50^th^ birthday was fake.

**Message:** Van Orden claimed he wanted “every bit” of information about Epstein released, but it took him 11 months to vote to release the Epstein files and he did only after Trump gave Republicans permission. 

### **VAN ORDEN WAS PHOTOGRAPHED NEAR CAPITOL GROUNDS ON JANUARY 6TH** 

-   Van Orden [_attended_](https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-presidential-washington-election-2020-donald-trump-35be0e64d964726eacad5c4eda20d422) the “Stop the Steal” rally headlined by Donald Trump on January 6^th^, 2021.
-   Despite claiming he [_did not engage in the riot_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/15/derrick-van-orden-jan-6-congress/) or reach Capitol grounds, there was a [_photo of him_](https://www.thedailybeast.com/gop-candidate-bankrolled-jan-6-riot-trip-with-campaign-cash/) posted on Facebook within a restricted area on the Capitol Grounds on January 6^th^.
-   Van Orden’s campaign finance report also [_included_](https://www.thedailybeast.com/gop-candidate-bankrolled-jan-6-riot-trip-with-campaign-cash/) several charges for transportation and hotels in Washington, D.C. around January 6^th^, indicating that he used campaign money to fund his trip.

**Message:** Van Orden has demonstrated time and time again that he is unfit to serve as a congressman.
