# **How To Win Against Tom Barrett**

Tom Barrett’s record is out of step with Michiganders. In Congress, he voted to take health care away from thousands of Michiganders, while pretending to care about health care cuts. In the state legislature, he sided with big drug companies over patients. He defended DOGE as it destabilized Social Security operations and NIH research funding. And his campaign misled Black voters on when to vote. That mix hurts hospitals like UM-Health Sparrow Carson and McLaren Central Michigan, MSU researchers, seniors, students, and working families across Ingham, Clinton, Shiawassee, Livingston, and parts of Eaton/Genesee/Oakland counties. 

### **BARRETT VOTED FOR DEVASTATING HEALTH CARE CUTS**

-   After signing a [_performative letter_](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/23/congress/gop-centrists-defend-obamacare-00200287) urging GOP leadership not to make cuts to Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act, Barrett [_voted_](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that would kick [_17 million Americans_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including [_nearly 12 million Americans_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off of Medicaid. An estimated [_24,000 Michiganders_](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) could lose their health insurance as a result of his vote.
-   Barrett’s vote also put hospitals [_in Michigan_](https://www.battlecreekenquirer.com/story/news/local/michigan/2025/07/09/cuts-to-medicaid-could-lead-to-4-michigan-hospitals-closing/84518782007/) at risk of closing.

 **Message:** Barrett voted to kick thousands of Michiganders off their health coverage all to give billionaires tax breaks. 

### **BARRETT SIDED WITH BIG PHARMA OVER MICHIGANDERS**

-   Barrett [_opposed_](https://www.argus-press.com/news/news_local/article_68a63804-495a-5c21-a611-640a0ecff35a.html#tncms-source=login) the Inflation Reduction Act, which [_lowered prescription drugs costs_](https://www.hhs.gov/inflation-reduction-act/index.html) and [_capped the cost of insulin at $35 per month_](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-facts-about-the-35-insulin-copay-cap-in-medicare/) for seniors. More than [_348,000 Michiganders_](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ira-rx-prices-michigan.pdf) on Medicare took prescription drugs that were selected for price negotiation under the Inflation Reduction Act’s provisions.
-   In Lansing, Barrett [_voted_](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/michigan/2022/10/21/democrat-elissa-slotkin-republican-tom-barrett-michigan-7th-district-congress/69518573007/) to preserve Michigan’s unique law that [_shielded pharmaceutical companies_](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/06/15/michigan-law-shields-opioid-lawsuits/649577002/) from being sued by Michigan families. The law was finally [_repealed_](https://michiganadvance.com/2023/12/07/whitmer-signs-repeal-of-nations-only-immunity-law-that-shielded-drugmakers-from-legal-liability/) in 2023, after Barrett left the state legislature.

 **Message:** Barrett signed with big pharma over Michigan families who deserve cheaper prescription drugs and accountability.
 
### **BARRETT VOTED FOR MASSIVE CUTS TO MEDICARE**
- 	While running for Congress in 2024, Barrett [promised](https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/09/barrett-hertel-us-house-race-michigan/75069362007/) he would not cut funding for Social Security or Medicare. Then, after getting elected, Barrett [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml) for a bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would trigger [nearly $500 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare absent future congressional action. 

**Message**: Barrett broke his promise and voted for massive cuts to health care services seniors rely on all to give tax breaks to billionaires. 

### **BARRETT WAS THE DECIDING VOTE TO PROTECT TRUMP’S TARIFFS**

-   Barrett [_promised_](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2025/04/07/tom-barrett-town-hall-meeting-congress/82983251007/) to protect Michigan farmers from the impact of Trump’s tariffs. Then he voted four times to protect the tariffs, including in April 2025 when he was the [_deciding vote_](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect tariffs from being repealed by Congress, dooming Michiganders who relied on him to a trade war and rising prices. Tariffs are contributing to [_higher food prices_](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi) and [_higher costs for small retailers_](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/michigan/2025/05/23/how-tariffs-are-hurting-small-michigan-retailers/83743916007/), and are [_hurting Michigan farmers_](https://bridgemi.com/michigan-government/trade-war-drought-squeeze-michigan-farmers-heading-to-fall-harvest/).

**Message:** Higher prices and broken promises – Barrett chose Trump’s trade war over affordability for Michiganders.

### **BARRETT SUPPORTED ATTACKS ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICAL RESEARCH MICHIGAN FAMILIES RELY ON**

-   As DOGE triggered mass federal layoffs and agency slowdowns, Barrett minimized the fallout, telling constituents programs were merely [_“paused and under review.”_](https://apnews.com/article/musk-trump-doge-social-security-92de2ce547df0dcdcc00a5876e1a7bd6) But DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [_affecting_](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [_federal government’s_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) [_ability_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/) to [_deliver services_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. More than [_171,835 Michiganders_](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/mi.pdf) in Barrett’s district relied on Social Security benefits.
-   He [_defended_](https://heartlandsignal.com/2025/03/31/michigan-rep-tom-barrett-defends-nih-cuts/) Trump moves to slash National Institutes of Health funding, calling it a “reasonable approach,” even as Michigan State University leaders said proposed cuts would be a [_“deathblow”_](https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2025/02/trump-nih-cuts-could-be-a-deathblow-for-critical-research-on-grand-rapids-medical-mile.html) for critical medical research.
-   Barrett’s own March 2025 tele-town hall showed the backlash: [_70% of participants said they disapproved of DOGE_](https://www.wkar.org/wkar-news/2025-03-11/more-than-two-thirds-of-rep-barrett-town-hall-attendees-say-they-dont-support-doge).

**Message**: Barrett called Trump’s cuts “reasonable” while seniors faced longer lines and medical researchers faced devastating cuts. 

### Despite Calling for their release, it took barrett 11 months to vote to release the epstein files

-   In November 2025, after 11 months, Barrett [finally voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml) to release the Epstein files, but [only after Donald Trump gave House Republicans permission](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115562626931599548) to do so. Previously, despite having [come out](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/26/jeffrey-epstein-files-congress-tom-barrett-department-of-justice-donald-trump-massie-khanna/85362263007/) in support of releasing the files, even co-sponsoring Thomas Massie’s resolution to do so, Barrett was the [deciding vote in July](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml) to [protect accused pedophiles named in the Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj). Even though he [co-sponsored](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581/cosponsors?pageSort=alphaByParty) Thomas Massie’s resolution, he [never signed](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/06/adam-hollier-shri-thaneder-congress-detroit-secretary-of-state-tom-barrett-epstein-linda-mcmahon/85995848007/) [the discharge petition](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209) that allowed it to come to the House floor for a vote. 
-   He also [claimed](https://www.notus.org/congress/republicans-trump-letter-jeffrey-epstein) he had not seen the letter that Trump sent Epstein for his 50^th^ birthday. 

**Message:** Despite calling for their release, it took Barrett 11 months to vote to release the Epstein files. 

### **BARRETT’S CAMPAIGN TOLD BLACK VOTERS THE WRONG ELECTION DATE**

-   During his 2024 campaign, Barrett’s campaign [_ran an ad_](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/michigan-republican-misleading-ad.html) with the incorrect election date in a Black-owned newspaper in Michigan.
-   Black lawmakers in Michigan [_filed a complaint_](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/michigan-republican-misleading-ad.html) alleging he tried to disenfranchise Black voters and pointing out that his campaign ran a similar advertisement in a different newspaper with the correct election date.
-   Barrett’s campaign [_claimed_](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2024/10/15/nessel-sends-barrett-campaign-cease-and-desist-notice-over-error-in-ad/75693007007/) the incident was a “minor error” and the situation was “much ado about nothing.”
-   The Michigan Attorney General [_sent_](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2024/10/15/nessel-sends-barrett-campaign-cease-and-desist-notice-over-error-in-ad/75693007007/) the Barrett campaign a cease and desist notice over the ad.

**Message:** Barrett lied to Black voters, jeopardizing their ability to vote.
