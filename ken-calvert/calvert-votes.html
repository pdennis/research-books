<h1>Ken Calvert – Key Votes</h1>
<h2>Calvert Voted To Threaten Southern Californians' Health Care</h2>
<p><strong>July 2025: Calvert Voted For The Senate FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Extended $4 Trillion In Expiring Tax Cuts, Added New Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025, Calvert voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, the “motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214.

  <li><strong>The Congressional Budget Office Estimated That 11.8 Million People Would Become Uninsured As A Result Of The Medicaid Cuts In Republicans’ Reconciliation Bill.</strong> According to the Washington Post, "The bill, which narrowly passed the Senate on Tuesday and now heads back to the House, would effectively accomplish what Republicans have long failed to do: unwind many of the key components of the ACA, President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement, which dramatically increased the number of Americans with access to health insurance. To start, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Senate version of the bill would result in 11.8 million more uninsured in 2034, mostly because of Medicaid cuts, compared with 10.9 million if the House version became law."

<p><strong>May 2025: Calvert Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Included $3.8 Trillion In Tax Cuts Offset By $1.5 Trillion In Spending Reductions To Programs Like Medicaid And The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</strong> In May 2025, Calvert voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would provide for approximately $3.8 trillion in net tax cuts and $321 billion in military, border enforcement and judiciary spending, offset by $1.5 trillion in spending reductions, as instructed in the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). It would raise the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion and provide for increased spending on defense and border security, spending cuts on social safety net programs, such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It also includes a mix of tax breaks for businesses and individuals; tax increases on universities and foundations; and a phase-down of clean energy tax credits. […] It would reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by requiring states to shoulder more of the cost, expand work requirements for SNAP, extend programs authorized under the 2018 farm bill, and prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Program. As amended, it would cap state and local tax deductions at $40,000 for households with incomes below $500,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 215 to 214.

  <li><strong>The House GOP Budget Bill Was Estimated To Increase The Uninsured Population By 8.6 Million By 2034.</strong>&nbsp;According to CNN, “The Medicaid and Affordable Care Act provisions in the package could result in 8.6 million more people being uninsured in 2034, according to an early CBO estimate released by Democratic lawmakers. That number is expected to grow with the latest changes.” [CNN, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/what-is-in-trump-tax-spending-cuts-package">5/28/25</a>]</li>

<p><strong>February 2025: Calvert Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Framework That Included $2 Trillion In Cuts, Raised The Statutory Debt Limit By $4 Trillion, And Required House Committees To Recommend Legislation That Would Implement Trump’s Agenda.</strong> In February 2025, Calvert voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the concurrent resolution that would recommend a budget for fiscal 2025 and budget levels through fiscal 2034. The resolution would assume minimum savings of $1.5 trillion over 10 years and 2.6 percent economic growth over the same period. It also would require the statutory debt limit to be raised by $4 trillion. It also would authorize the House Ways and Means Committee to increase deficits by $4.5 trillion over 10 years to extend the 2017 tax cuts and implement new tax cuts proposed by the White House. It also would provide instructions for the budget reconciliation process through which separate legislation could be considered and passed in the Senate via a simple majority vote. The measure would deliver instructions to 11 House committees to report legislation that would implement President Donald Trump’s agenda, such as expanding tax cuts and bolstering border security and immigration enforcement. The committees would be required to report their legislative recommendations to the House Budget Committee by March 27, 2025. It also would set a $2 trillion target for the spending cuts to be submitted to the House Budget Committee. The resolution also would stipulate that if the committees don't reach that target, the Ways and Means’ reconciliation instructions to increase the deficit by a maximum of $4.5 trillion would be decreased by the amount the other committees come in below the target. Similarly, it would stipulate that Ways and Means could increase the deficit above the $4.5 trillion level by the amount of savings the committees achieve above the $2 trillion target.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 217 to 215.

  <li><strong>New York Times Reported The $880 Billion In Cuts Required By The Republican Budget Proposal Would Have To Come From Medicaid, Medicare, Or CHIP.</strong>&nbsp;According to the New York Times, "The budget resolution itself is silent on whether Congress cuts Medicaid, which provides health coverage to 72 million poor and disabled Americans. But it instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the program, to cut spending by $880 billion over the next decade. If the committee can’t save at least that much, the entire effort could be imperiled because of the special process Congress is using to avoid a Senate filibuster. Ten other committees have their own instructions to follow, though none have been assigned with cutting nearly as much.&nbsp; It’s not so simple as finding the cuts elsewhere. The special process, known as budget reconciliation, means Republicans will have to find all $880 billion from within the Energy and Commerce Committee’s jurisdiction. That leaves them with fewer options than one might think. […] If Republicans want to avoid major cuts to Medicaid, the largest pot of available money is in the other big government health insurance program: Medicare. […] Even if the committee cuts everything that’s not health care to $0, it will still be more than $600 billion short.&nbsp; The committee could also save around $200 billion by eliminating the Children’s Health Insurance Program, but that option has not been raised by the budget committee or anyone in House leadership. […] Even if all of these cuts, revenues and rule cancellations from outside health care can pass muster, the committee will still be left with hundreds of billions of dollars to cut to hit its goal. Mathematically, the budget committee’s instructions mean the committee would need to make major cuts to either Medicare, Medicaid or both."

<h2>Calvert Voted To Repeal The Affordable Care Act, Which Helped Nearly 2 Million Californians Get Health Insurance</h2>
<h3>2017: Calvert Voted For House Republicans’ American Health Care Act, Which Sought To Repeal The Affordable Care Act</h3>
<p><strong>2017: Calvert Voted For The American Health Care Act That Which Would Result In 23 Million Fewer Americans With Health Insurance By 2026.</strong> In May 2017, Calvert voted for the American Health Care Act which would have significantly repealed portions of the Affordable Care Act by cutting Medicaid, cutting taxes on the rich, removing safeguard for pre-existing conditions and defunding Planned Parenthood. The overall legislation would have in part, also according to Congressional Quarterly, “ma[d]e extensive changes to the 2010 health care overhaul law, by effectively repealing the individual and employer mandates as well as most of the taxes that finance the current system. It would [have], in 2020, convert[ed] Medicaid into a capped entitlement that would provide[d] fixed federal payments to states and end[ed] additional federal funding for the 2010 law’s joint federal-state Medicaid expansion. It would prohibit federal funding to any entity, such as Planned Parenthood, that performs abortions and receives more than $350 million a year in Medicaid funds. […] It would [have] allow[ed] states to receive waivers to exempt insurers from having to provide certain minimum benefits.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 217 to 213. The bill, in modified forms, died in the Senate.

  <li><strong>The American Health Care Act Would Have Resulted In 14 Million Additional Uninsured Americans In 2018, Rising To 23 Million In 2026.</strong> According to the New York Times, “A bill to dismantle the Affordable Care Act that narrowly passed the House this month would leave 14 million more people uninsured next year than under President Barack Obama’s health law — and 23 million more in 2026, the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday. Some of the nation’s sickest would pay much more for health care. Under the House bill, the number of uninsured would be slightly lower, but deficits would be somewhat higher, than the budget office estimated before Republican leaders made a series of changes to win enough votes for passage. Beneath the headline-grabbing numbers, those legislative tweaks would bring huge changes to the American health care system.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/us/politics/cbo-congressional-budget-office-health-care.html?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=52379006&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8JowhXmTnNxBSsT4OZcp7PYwoWKl7paVQgQnFBORTq-idxVuSUD7BsR3LHYh9kcP2xP218ZEFzZp-N6B5qRUgOjl2P4L8z8kdcWAjuUC_oZ56GIec&amp;_hsmi=52379006&amp;_r=0">5/24/17</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The American Health Care Act Would Have Cut Medicaid By $834 Billon Over Ten Years, Including A Roll Back Of The Medicaid Expansion.</strong> According to the New York Times, “The House repeal bill was approved on May 4 by a vote of 217 to 213, with no support from Democrats. It would eliminate tax penalties for people who go without health insurance and roll back state-by-state expansions of&nbsp;Medicaid, which have provided coverage to millions of low-income people. And in place of government-subsidized insurance policies offered exclusively on the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces, the bill would offer tax credits of $2,000 to $4,000 a year, depending on age. […] The bill would reduce projected spending on Medicaid, the program for low-income people, by $834 billion over 10 years, and 14 million fewer people would be covered by Medicaid in 2026 — a reduction of about 17 percent from the enrollment expected under current law, the budget office said.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/us/politics/cbo-congressional-budget-office-health-care.html?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=52379006&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8JowhXmTnNxBSsT4OZcp7PYwoWKl7paVQgQnFBORTq-idxVuSUD7BsR3LHYh9kcP2xP218ZEFzZp-N6B5qRUgOjl2P4L8z8kdcWAjuUC_oZ56GIec&amp;_hsmi=52379006&amp;_r=0">5/24/17</a>]</li>

<h3>2013: Ken Calvert Voted With House Republicans to Shut the Government Down Over the Affordable Care Act</h3>
<h4>9/19/13: Calvert Voted To Fund The Federal Government Through Mid-December, If The Affordable Care Act Was Also Permanently Defunded</h4>
<p><strong>2013: Calvert Voted To Fund The Federal Government At Current Levels Through Mid-December 2013 And To Permanently Defund The Affordable Care Act.</strong> In September 2013, Calvert voted for funding the federal government through December 15th while permanently defunding the Affordable Care Act. According to Congressional Quarterly, “The resolution continues funding for most government operations through Dec. 15 at current, post-sequester FY 2013 levels in order to continue government operations once FY 2014 begins on Oct. 1. It also permanently defunds the 2010 health care overhaul and allows the U.S. Treasury, once the statutory debt limit is reached, to continue borrowing over the debt limit until Dec. 15, 2014 — but only to pay the principal and interest on both government debt held by the public and on obligations to the Social Security trust fund.” The House passed the resolution by a vote of 230 to 189. The Senate subsequently replaced the text of the House-passed continuing resolution with a “clean” one that funded the federal government through November 15, 2013, and sent that back to the House for further action. A separate bill, which ended the shutdown, later became law.

<h4>9/29/13: Calvert Voted To Prevent A Government Shutdown If The Measure Also Included A One-Year Delay Of The Affordable Care Act</h4>
<p><strong>2013: Calvert Voted To Attach A One-Year Delay Of The Affordable Care Act To A Continuing Resolution That Would Have Prevented A Government Shutdown.</strong> In September 2013, Calvert voted to amend a proposed continuing appropriations resolution that would have funded the federal government through November 15, 2013, by adding provisions that, according to Congressional Quarterly, “would delay for one year implementation of any provision of the 2010 health care overhaul that would take effect between Oct. 1, 2013, and Dec. 31, 2014, including the individual mandate and the imposition or increase of specified taxes and fees. It also would allow companies and insurance providers until 2015 to opt out of mandated birth control coverage for religious or moral reasons, and bar appropriations and transfers from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Fund. It also would set the expiration date for the continuing appropriations to Dec. 15, 2013.” The vote was on a motion to concur, with a further amendment, to the Senate’s amendment to the continuing resolution that the House had passed 10 days earlier. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 231 to 192. The Senate later rejected the House’s amendment.

<h4>9/30/13: Calvert Voted To Prevent A Government Shutdown If There Was Also A One-Year Delay Of The Affordable Care Act’s Individual Mandate</h4>
<p><strong>2013: Calvert Voted To Add A One Year Delay Of The Affordable Care Act’s Individual Mandate To The Senate’s “Clean” Continuing Resolution That Would Have Prevented A Government Shutdown.</strong> In September 2013, Calvert voted for an amendment that, according to Congressional Quarterly, “provide[d] fiscal 2014 continuing appropriations. The House amendment would fund the government until Dec. 15, 2013, and delay for one year a requirement in the 2010 health care overhaul that all individuals purchase health insurance or pay a tax penalty. It also would require the president, vice president, members of Congress, congressional staff and political appointees to purchase health insurance through the health care law's state insurance exchanges and would limit the subsidies they may receive for purchasing insurance.” The vote was on a motion to recede from prior House amendments and concur, with the specified amendment, to the Senate amendment to the continuing resolution. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 228 to 201. The Senate subsequently rejected the House’s amendment.

<p><strong>2013: Calvert Effectively Voted To Add A One Year Delay Of The Affordable Care Act’s Individual Mandate To The Senate’s “Clean” Continuing Resolution That Would Have Prevented A Government Shutdown.</strong> In September 2013, Calvert voted for the proposed rule that, according to the House Rules Committee’s report, “provides for the consideration of the Senate amendment to H.J. Res. 59, the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014. The resolution makes in order a motion offered by the chair of the Committee on Appropriations or his designee that the House recede from its amendments and concur in the Senate amendment with the amendment printed in [the Rules Committee’s report on the rule]. The resolution provides 40 minutes of debate on the motion equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The resolution provides that the Senate amendment and the motion shall be considered as read. The resolution waives all points of order against consideration of the motion.” The House adopted the rule by a vote of 225 to 204.

<h4>9/30/13: Calvert Effectively Voted Against Preventing The Government Shutdown</h4>
<p><strong>2013: Calvert Effectively Voted To Block House Democrats The Ability To Force An Up-Or-Down Vote On The Senate-Passed “Clean” Continuing Resolution.</strong> In September 2013, Calvert voted for a motion to, according to Congressional Quarterly, “order the previous question (thus ending debate and the possibility of amendment) on the rule (H Res 367) that would provide for House floor consideration of the Senate amendment to the joint resolution that would provide fiscal 2014 continuing appropriations.” The rule only permitted consideration of a Rules Committee-specified amendment to the Senate-passed continuing resolution. The House adopted the motion to order the previous question by a vote of 229 to 198. The House then approved the proposed rule.

<h4>10/2/13: Calvert Effectively Voted Against Ending The Government Shutdown</h4>
<p><strong>2013: Calvert Effectively Voted To Block A Vote On The Senate’s “Clean” Continuing Resolution, Which Would Have Re-Opened The Government.</strong> In October 2013, Calvert voted for a motion to end debate on a proposed House rule that, according to Congressional Quarterly, “provide[d] for House floor consideration of the joint resolutions to provide fiscal 2014 continuing appropriations for national parks and museums ( H J Res 70), District of Columbia (H J Res 71), veterans’ programs (H J Res 72), the National Institutes of Health (H J Res 73) and a bill (HR 3230) to provide temporary funds for National Guard and Reserves inactive duty.” The vote was on ordering the previous question, which would end debate on – and prevent any further amendment to – the proposed rule.

<p><strong>2013: During 2013 Government Shutdown, Calvert Effectively Voted To Block A Vote On Funding The Entire U.S. Government Through November 15, 2013 Without Any Changes To Affordable Care Act.</strong> In October 2013, Calvert effectively voted to block a vote to fund the entire federal government through November 15, 2013. The House was considering a joint resolution to fund the National Park Service and National Park System, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, and the National Gallery of Art through December 15, 2013. According to Congressional Quarterly, “Before passing the spending legislation Wednesday, the House affirmed, […] along party lines, a motion to table the appeal of a ruling that offering a continuing resolution—without health care policy riders—is not germane. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., who was presiding over floor debate, ruled the motion not germane because it exceeded the jurisdiction of the legislation (H J Res 70) funding national parks and museums. Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, attempted to offer the Senate-passed stopgap spending measure (H J Res 59) funding the entire government as a motion to recommit. Its passage would send the measure to the president who has said he would sign it into law to reopen the government.” The vote was on a motion to table an appeal of the ruling of the chair that Van Hollen’s (D-MD) proposed motion to recommit with instructions was not germane; that ruling had the effect of blocking a vote on the motion to recommit. The House tabled the appeal by a vote of 230 to 194, killing the motion to recommit. The underlying joint resolution then passed the House, but as of October 3, 2013, no further action had occurred on it.

Ann Kirkpatrick (D-AZ) moved to “recommit the joint resolution to the House Appropriations Committee and report it back immediately with language providing for the House to recede from its amendment and concur in the Senate amendment to the fiscal 2014 continuing resolution (H J Res 59), which would provide continuing appropriations for government operations through Nov. 15, 2013.” The eventual vote was on a motion to table an appeal of the ruling of the chair that Kirkpatrick’s motion to recommit was not germane; that ruling had the effect of blocking a vote on her motion. The House tabled the appeal by a vote of 216 to 180, killing the motion to recommit.

It would allow federal borrowing to continue through Feb. 7, 2014, after the president certifies that the U.S. Treasury cannot pay its obligations and would set up an expedited process for Congress to consider resolutions of disapproval for the debt limit increase authorized by the bill. It also would provide for retroactive pay for federal employees who worked through the government shutdown that began on Oct. 1, 2013 and for workers furloughed during that time.” The vote was on a motion to concur with the Senate’s version of the bill, which the House agreed to by a vote of 285 to 144.

It […] bar[red] the use of federal funds to pay for abortions in the new programs, except in the cases of rape or incest or if the woman's life is in danger. Insurance companies could not deny coverage based on pre-existing medical conditions beginning in 2014, and could not drop coverage of people who become ill.

It would raise the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion and provide for increased spending on defense and border security, spending cuts on social safety net programs, such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It also includes a mix of tax breaks for businesses and individuals; tax increases on universities and foundations; and a phase-down of clean energy tax credits. […] It would reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by requiring states to shoulder more of the cost, expand work requirements for SNAP, extend programs authorized under the 2018 farm bill, and prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Program.

This letter responds to your questions concerning the sequestration (the cancellation of budgetary resources) in accordance with the Statutory Pay‑As‑You‑Go Act of 2010 (S-PAYGO) that would occur if an enacted bill raised deficits by $2.3 trillion over 10 years. Under S-PAYGO, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is required to maintain 5- and 10-year scorecards that it updates with the estimated cumulative changes in revenues and outlays generated by newly enacted legislation. […] The 4 percent maximum reduction in Medicare spending would apply to sequestration orders for years after 2026. If OMB ordered a sequestration of $230 billion for each year through 2034, the ordered reductions in Medicare spending would increase to about $75 billion in 2034 and would total roughly $490 billion over the 2027–2034 period."

It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214.

<h3>Calvert Has Previously Voted for Massive Medicare Cuts</h3>
<p><strong>2017: Calvert Voted For The GOP FY 2018 Budget Resolution, Which Started The Process Towards Tax Reform And Called For Cutting Medicare By $473 Billion.</strong> In October 2017, Calvert voted for a budget resolution that would have, according to The Hill, “The spending blueprint is key to Republicans’ efforts to pass tax reform because it includes instructions that will allow the plan to avoid a Democratic filibuster. […] The budget, meant to outline spending for the fiscal year, was widely viewed as a mere vehicle for passing tax reform. […] The budget would allow the Senate GOP’s tax plan to add up to $1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade, a proposal that has raised concerns with fiscal hawks in the GOP. Its instructions call for the Senate Finance Committee to report a tax bill by Nov. 13. Still, the document outlines the Senate GOP’s political vision. It maintains spending at 2017 levels for the year, but would then cut nondefense spending in subsequent years, leading to a $106 billion cut in 2027. It would also allow defense levels to continue rising at their current rates, reaching $684 billion at the end of a decade. The resolution also proposes $473 billion in cuts to Medicare’s baseline spending over a decade and about $1 trillion from Medicaid, though those provisions are not enforceable without additional legislation.” The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment. The House agreed to the motion, thereby agreeing to the budget by a vote of 216 to 212.

The budget also relies heavily on a war contingency fund to boost military spending — a move that allows Republicans to go around the strict spending caps outlined in a 2011 deficit deal. It calls for finding $430 billion in cuts from Medicare but offers few details on how to achieve those savings. It also proposes cuts to Medicaid and welfare programs, while not increasing taxes.

<h4>2011: Calvert Supported The Cut, Cap, And Balance Plan, Which Would Have Resulted In Massive Cuts To Medicare</h4>
<p><strong>2011: Calvert Voted For The “Cut, Cap And Balance” Plan That Would Drastically Cut Federal Spending To Balance The Budget, All In Exchange For Raising Debt Limit.</strong> In July 2011, Calvert voted for the so-called “Cut, Cap and Balance” legislation. According to Congressional Quarterly Today, “Along with the balanced-budget amendment provisions, the House passed ‘cut, cap, balance’ bill proposes drastic cuts in fiscal 2012 spending and setting future spending limits. Specifically, it would set fiscal 2012 discretionary spending at $1.019 trillion, the level set in the House's budget resolution for the year (H Con Res 34), and cap annual federal spending at 19.9 percent of gross domestic product by fiscal 2021, down from an estimated 22.5 percent for fiscal 2012.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 234 to 190. The bill was tabled in the Senate.

  <li><strong>CBPP Said The Cut, Cap And Balance Bill “Would Necessitate Deep Cuts” To Social Security And Medicare, “Big Cuts” To Social Security And Medicare Would Be “Inevitable.”</strong> According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, “The legislation would inexorably subject Social Security and Medicare to deep reductions. The measure does not cut Social Security or Medicare in 2012. And it does not subject them to automatic cuts if its global spending caps are missed. It is inconceivable, however, that policymakers would meet the bill’s severe annual spending caps through automatic across-the-board cuts year after year; if they did, key government functions would be crippled. Policymakers would have little alternative but to institute deep cuts in specific programs. And as noted elsewhere in this statement, before the debt limit could be raised, Congress would have to approve a constitutional balanced budget amendment that essentially requires cuts even deeper than those in the Ryan budget. Reaching and maintaining a balanced budget in the decade ahead while barring any tax increases would necessitate deep cuts in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. After all, by 2021, total expenditures for these three programs will be nearly 45 percent greater than expenditures for all other programs (except interest payments) combined. Big cuts in these programs would be inevitable.” [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=3537">7/16/11</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>CBPP Said Cut, Cap, And Balance “One Of The Most Ideologically Extreme Pieces Of Major Budget Legislation To Come Before Congress In Years.”</strong> According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, “The ‘Cut, Cap, and Balance Act’ that the House of Representatives will vote on next week stands out as one of the most ideologically extreme pieces of major budget legislation to come before Congress in years, if not decades. It would go a substantial way toward enshrining Grover Norquist’s version of America into law.” [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=3537">7/16/11</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Center For American Progress Said Cut, Cap, Balance Means “Simply Massive Cuts” To Social Security And Medicare.</strong> According to the Center for American Progress, “There is no way around the basic arithmetic. The only way to achieve that level of spending is by radically altering some fundamental public programs and services. A federal spending cap may sound innocuous but it is simply massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid by another name.” [Center for American Progress,&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110723073451/http:/www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/07/spending_cap.html">7/18/11</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Cut, Cap, And Balance Would Require More Extreme Cuts Than Ryan Budget Plan.</strong> According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, “The constitutional balanced budget amendment that the House Judiciary Committee began considering June 2 and is expected to pass next week, is a highly ideological measure that would force Congress to enact the Republican Study Committee’s extreme budget plan or something similar to it. Even the House-passed budget plan of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan would not pass muster under the proposal; the more draconian Republican Study Committee (RSC) budget&nbsp;or a close equivalent would be required.” [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3508">6/6/11</a>]</li>

It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by $10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at $1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the budget.” The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution.

  <li><strong>Increasing The Medicare Eligibility Age Would Raise The Costs Of Healthcare Across The Economy.</strong> According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, “[R]aising Medicare’s eligibility age would not only fail to constrain health care costs across the economy; it would raise them. Medicare provides health coverage more cheaply than private health insurance plans because it has lower administrative costs and pays less to providers. Raising the Medicare age would shift costs to most of the 65- and 66-year olds who would lose Medicare coverage, to remaining Medicare beneficiaries, to employers that provide coverage for their retirees, and to states. These cost increases would, in total, more than offset the savings to the federal government.” [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=3731">3/28/12</a>]</li>

  <li><strong>Because Ryan’s Plan Would Also Repeal The ACA, Seniors Aged 65 And 66 Without Employer Coverage Would Face High Premium Costs Due To Their Age – Or Might Be Unable To Obtain Any Insurance Due To A Pre-Existing Condition.</strong> According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, “At the same time, the plan would repeal health reform’s coverage provisions.&nbsp; Consequently, 65- and 66-year-olds would have neither Medicare nor access to health insurance exchanges in which they could buy coverage at an affordable price and receive subsidies to help them secure coverage if their incomes are low. This change would drive 65- and 66-year-olds who don’t have employer-sponsored coverage into an individual insurance market that would be poorly regulated (since the Ryan plan repeals the Affordable Care Act’s insurance reforms) and would charge older individuals extremely high premiums.&nbsp;People of limited means would be affected most harshly because they would not be able to afford private coverage.&nbsp;In addition, 65- and 66-year-olds with a pre-existing medical condition often would not be able to purchase coverage at any price.&nbsp; As a result, many 65- and 66-year-olds would find themselves uninsured.” [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=4121">4/8/14</a>]</li>

People in the top 2 percent of the annual income distribution of the Medicare-eligible population would receive 30 percent of the premium support amount described above; people in the next 6 percent of the distribution would receive 50 percent of the amount described above; and people in the remaining 92 percent of the distribution would receive the full premium support amount.” [Congressional Budget Office,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12128/04-05-ryan_letter.pdf#page=10">4/5/11</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Budget Would Index The Premium Support Amount To Overall Consumer Prices.</strong> According to the CBO, “[T]he proposal would convert the current Medicare program to a system under which beneficiaries received premium support payments—payments that would be used to help pay the premiums for a private health insurance policy and would grow over time with overall consumer prices.” [Congressional Budget Office,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12128/04-05-ryan_letter.pdf#page=10">4/5/11</a>]</li>

  <li><strong>2013: CBO Issued New Analysis Of Premium Support Plans Using “Detailed Modeling” Of Key Actors, Said April 2011 “Limited” Analysis Of Ryan Plan Did Not Capture Its “Full Effects” On Beneficiaries’ Payments.</strong> According to the Congressional Budget Office, “CBO has previously estimated the budgetary effects of revamping Medicare as a premium support system. But those earlier analyses were limited in at least two key respects: They did not include detailed modeling of beneficiaries’ choices among alternative insurance plans, and they did not include detailed modeling of insurers’ behavior regarding bids or payments to health care providers. Thus, none of those analyses captured the full effects of a competitive system on federal spending or payments by beneficiaries. The analysis in this report incorporates such modeling. In addition, this report differs from some previous analyses by CBO in considering different illustrative options for a premium support system instead of a specific proposal.” [Congressional Budget Office,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/09-18-PremiumSupport.pdf">9/18/13</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>CBO Said Plans Analyzed In 2013 Using “Substantial Improvements” In CBO Capabilities, But Noted Those Plans&nbsp; “Differ In Important Ways” From 2011 Proposal, Such As Having The Federal Support Amount Fixed Instead Of Determined By Bidding.</strong> According to the Congressional Budget Office, “The treatment in this report is substantially different from the rough analysis of a specific premium support proposal published by CBO in April 2011. Not only have there been substantial improvements in CBO’s modeling of the behavior of beneficiaries and insurers, but the options examined in this report differ in important ways from that earlier proposal. For example, the earlier proposal included a grandfathering provision, and CBO estimated that only 4 percent of Medicare spending in 2022 would be accounted for by premium support payments under that proposal. The proposal also specified a federal contribution that was initially fixed (rather than determined through bidding) and that would keep pace with the consumer price index for all urban consumers (at a rate that CBO estimated would be substantially slower than the rate of growth in Medicare spending under current law). Moreover, because of the simple formula for determining federal spending in that proposal, CBO projected such spending over a longer period than it does in this report.” [Congressional Budget Office,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/09-18-PremiumSupport.pdf">9/18/13</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>CBO Said 2011 Analysis Of Ryan Plan Found Higher Costs Than 2013 Analysis Of Other, Similar Plans Because Ryan Plan Eliminated Traditional Medicare Entirely And CBO Had Lowered Its Estimates Of Private Health Insurance Premium Growth.</strong> According to CBO, “CBO’s estimates of the total payments by beneficiaries and of combined federal spending and beneficiaries’ payments for the 2011 proposal were much higher than the estimates for the two options in this report primarily because CBO projected for that earlier report that health care spending covered by private plans would be much higher initially and would grow faster than the agency currently estimates. The difference arose from two main factors: First, the earlier proposal did not include the Medicare FFS program as a bidding plan in the premium support system. Because that program was not present to put downward pressure on the rates paid to providers by private insurers, CBO projected, the premiums of private plans would be substantially higher than they would be under the premium support options discussed in this report. Second, more recent information has led CBO to make a downward revision in its projections of the future growth rate of private health insurance premiums.” [Congressional Budget Office,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/09-18-PremiumSupport.pdf">9/18/13</a>]</li>

<p><strong>2011: Calvert Voted For The “Cut, Cap And Balance” Plan That Would Drastically Cut Federal Spending To Balance The Budget, All In Exchange For Raising Debt Limit.</strong> In July 2011, Calvert voted for the so-called “Cut, Cap and Balance” legislation. According to Congressional Quarterly Today, “Along with the balanced-budget amendment provisions, the House passed ‘cut, cap, balance’ bill proposes drastic cuts in fiscal 2012 spending and setting future spending limits. Specifically, it would set fiscal 2012 discretionary spending at $1.019 trillion, the level set in the House's budget resolution for the year (H Con Res 34), and cap annual federal spending at 19.9 percent of gross domestic product by fiscal 2021, down from an estimated 22.5 percent for fiscal 2012.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 234 to 190. The bill was tabled in the Senate.

<ul>
  <li><strong>CBPP Said The Cut, Cap And Balance Bill “Would Necessitate Deep Cuts” To Social Security And Medicare, “Big Cuts” To Social Security And Medicare Would Be “Inevitable.”</strong> According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, “The legislation would inexorably subject Social Security and Medicare to deep reductions. The measure does not cut Social Security or Medicare in 2012. And it does not subject them to automatic cuts if its global spending caps are missed. It is inconceivable, however, that policymakers would meet the bill’s severe annual spending caps through automatic across-the-board cuts year after year; if they did, key government functions would be crippled. Policymakers would have little alternative but to institute deep cuts in specific programs. And as noted elsewhere in this statement, before the debt limit could be raised, Congress would have to approve a constitutional balanced budget amendment that essentially requires cuts even deeper than those in the Ryan budget. Reaching and maintaining a balanced budget in the decade ahead while barring any tax increases would necessitate deep cuts in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. After all, by 2021, total expenditures for these three programs will be nearly 45 percent greater than expenditures for all other programs (except interest payments) combined. Big cuts in these programs would be inevitable.” [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=3537">7/16/11</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>CBPP Said Cut, Cap, And Balance “One Of The Most Ideologically Extreme Pieces Of Major Budget Legislation To Come Before Congress In Years.”</strong> According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, “The ‘Cut, Cap, and Balance Act’ that the House of Representatives will vote on next week stands out as one of the most ideologically extreme pieces of major budget legislation to come before Congress in years, if not decades. It would go a substantial way toward enshrining Grover Norquist’s version of America into law.” [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=3537">7/16/11</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Center For American Progress Said Cut, Cap, Balance Means “Simply Massive Cuts” To Social Security And Medicare.</strong> According to the Center for American Progress, “There is no way around the basic arithmetic. The only way to achieve that level of spending is by radically altering some fundamental public programs and services. A federal spending cap may sound innocuous but it is simply massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid by another name.” [Center for American Progress,&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110723073451/http:/www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/07/spending_cap.html">7/18/11</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Cut, Cap, And Balance Would Require More Extreme Cuts Than Ryan Budget Plan.</strong> According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, “The constitutional balanced budget amendment that the House Judiciary Committee began considering June 2 and is expected to pass next week, is a highly ideological measure that would force Congress to enact the Republican Study Committee’s extreme budget plan or something similar to it. Even the House-passed budget plan of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan would not pass muster under the proposal; the more draconian Republican Study Committee (RSC) budget&nbsp;or a close equivalent would be required.” [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3508">6/6/11</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The National Committee To Preserve Social Security And Medicare Said Cut, Cap And Balance “Would Require Draconian Spending Cuts Of Such A Magnitude As To Force Policymakers To Severely Slash Medicare, Medicaid, And Many Other Programs While Opening The Door To Massive New Tax Cuts.”</strong> According to The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare:&nbsp; “As a result, these proposals would require draconian spending cuts of such a magnitude as to force policymakers to severely slash Medicare, Medicaid, and many other programs while opening the door to massive new tax cuts. What is most alarming to our members is that the amendment would negatively impact Social Security by essentially nullifying the trust funds as a source of funding for the payment of benefits.” [Letter - National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare,&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110728041347/http:/www.ncpssm.org/news/archive/letter_balanced_budget_amendment/">7/18/11</a>]</li>

<p><strong>2025: Calvert Effectively Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through March 2026.</strong> In September 2025, Calvert voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the resolution [that] would allow for the tolling (the pausing of counting) of days for resolutions of inquiry from Sept. 30, 2025 through March 31, 2026. It also would provide that each day during the period from April 9, 2025, through March 31, 2026. would not constitute a calendar day for the purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution to terminate President Donald Trump's April 2, 2025 executive order declaring a national emergency regarding tariffs on imported goods. The resolution also would provide that during the period for March 11, 2025 through March 31, 2026, would not constitute a calendar day for purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution terminating a national emergency executive order declared by President Trump on Feb. 1, 2025. Such an executive order concerned tariffs on many Canadian and Mexican imports and Chinese goods. The resolution also would provide that the provisions of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act would not apply through March 31, 2026 to a joint resolution terminating the national emergency.” The vote was on the rule. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 213 to 211.

  <li><strong>Support Was Won From GOP Holdouts Through A Promise Of A Vote Later In The Week To Shorten The Block To End In January Rather Than March.</strong>&nbsp;According to Politico, “GOP leaders flipped several of the Republican holdouts with a promise to add language shortening the block on tariff disapproval votes to a forthcoming measure set for approval later in the week, per two Republicans with direct knowledge of the agreement. The expiration date on the block will be reset from March 31 to the end of January, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Tuesday. It’s likely the Supreme Court will have ruled on a challenge to Trump’s tariff-declaring powers by then.” [Politico,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/16/congress/house-again-votes-to-surrender-tariff-powers-to-trump-00566975">9/16/25</a>]</li>

<h4>April 2025: Calvert Cast The Deciding Vote To Protect Trump’s Tariffs</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Calvert Cast The Deciding Vote For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through September 2025.</strong>&nbsp;In April 2025, Calvert voted for, “adoption of the rule (H Res 313) that would provide for floor consideration of the Senate amendment to the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). The rule would provide up to one hour of debate on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the measure. It also would block the expedited consideration of joint resolutions terminating President Donald Trump’s tariff actions under the April 2 executive order by providing that each day during the period from April 9, 2025 through Sept. 30, 2025, will not constitute a calendar day under the federal law pertaining to terminating national emergencies.” The vote was on the rule. The underlying legislation was the FY 2025 budget resolution. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 216 to 215. [House Vote 94, <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml">4/9/25</a>; Congressional Quarterly, <a href="https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/94?4">4/9/25</a>; Congressional Actions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/313/all-actions">H.Res. 313</a>;Congressional Actions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/14/all-actions">H.Con.

  <li><strong>Speaker Johnson Backed The Move, Claiming Trump Has “Executive Authority” And That The Tariffs Are “In The Interest Of The American People.”</strong>&nbsp;According to ABC News, “House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., defended the move, telling reporters, ‘I've made it very clear I think the president has executive authority. It's an appropriate level of authority to deal with the unfair trade practices. That's part of the role of the president is to negotiate with other countries.’ Johnson said Trump told him Tuesday night that ‘there are almost 70 countries that are [in] some stage in negotiation of more fair-trade agreement agreements with the United States. I think that is in the interest of the American people. I think that is an ‘America First’ policy that will be effective, and so we have to give them the space to do it.’” [ABC News,&nbsp;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-gop-moves-prevent-votes-rescinding-trump-tariffs/story?id=120644968">4/9/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Vote Was The Second Use Of The Procedural Tactic To Block Votes On The Tariffs, The First Use Of It Being In March.</strong>&nbsp;According to ABC News, “House Democrats, led by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., moved to force a vote on Tuesday on terminating the national emergency authority and blocking Trump's sweeping tariffs. Now, that vote is unlikely to occur. This is the second time Johnson has moved to stop the legislative calendar to prevent votes on Trump's authority on tariffs. Under House rules, these votes would typically come up within 15 calendar days but now will not if the ‘rule’ passes during the vote series Wednesday afternoon.” [ABC News,&nbsp;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-gop-moves-prevent-votes-rescinding-trump-tariffs/story?id=120644968">4/9/25</a>]</li>

<h4>April 2025: Calvert Voted To Protect Trump’s Tariffs</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Calvert Effectively Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through September 2025.</strong>&nbsp;In April 2025, Calvert voted for, “motion to order the previous question (thus ending debate and possibility of amendment) on the rule (H Res 313) that would providing for floor consideration of the Senate amendment to the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). The rule would provide up to one hour of debate on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the measure. It also would block the expedited consideration of joint resolutions terminating President Donald Trump’s tariff actions under the April 2 executive order by providing that each day during the period from April 9, 2025 through Sept. 30, 2025, will not constitute a calendar day under the federal law pertaining to terminating national emergencies.” The vote was on the previous question. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 217 to 212.

<h4>March 2025: Calvert Voted To Protect Trump’s Tariffs</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Calvert Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs.</strong>&nbsp;In March 2025, Calvert voted for, “the bill that would provide for Congressional disapproval of, and nullify, a December 2024 IRS rule related to gross proceeds reporting by brokers involved in digital asset sales. The rule imposed reporting requirements, beginning in 2027, on non-custodial barkers who participate in the decentralized digital asset market. It also required brokers to file information returns and provide payee statements reporting gross proceeds from certain digital asset sales and transactions.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 292 to 132.

  <li><strong>The Bill Effectively Blocked The House From Voting To Reverse Trump’s Tariffs On Mexico, Canada, And China For The Next Year.</strong>&nbsp;According to the New York Times, “Republican leaders on Tuesday slipped language into a procedural measure that would prevent any resolution to end the tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China from receiving a vote this year. It passed on party lines as part of a resolution that cleared the way for a vote later Tuesday on a government spending bill needed to prevent a shutdown at the end of the week.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html">3/11/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Bill Nullified A Law That Would Allow The House And Senate To End A Disaster Declared By The President.</strong> According to the New York Times, “In this case, Republican leaders did so using a particularly unusual contortion: They essentially declared the rest of the year one long day, nullifying a law that allows the House and Senate to jointly put an end to a disaster declared by the president.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html">3/11/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The National Emergencies Act Required Consideration Of Resolutions Ending A Presidentially Declared Emergency Within Fifteen Calendar Days But Republican Leadership Included A Measure In The Bill Declaring The Rest Of The Year Did Not Constitute A Calendar Day.</strong> According to the New York Times, “The national emergency law lays out a fast-track process for Congress to consider a resolution ending a presidential emergency, requiring committee consideration within 15 calendar days after one is introduced and a floor vote within three days after that. But the language House Republicans inserted in their measure on Tuesday declared that, ‘Each day for the remainder of the 119th Congress shall not constitute a calendar day’ for the purposes of the emergency that Mr. Trump declared on Feb. 1.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html">3/11/25</a>]</li>

<p><strong>July 2025: Calvert Voted For The Senate FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Extended $4 Trillion In Expiring Tax Cuts, Added New Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025, Calvert voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, the “motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214.

  <li><strong>The GOP Reconciliation Bill Would Cut SNAP Funding By $186 Billion, Which CBPP Said Constituted The “Largest Cut To SNAP In History.”</strong>&nbsp;According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, "The Senate Republican leadership’s reconciliation bill would dramatically raise costs and reduce food assistance for millions of people by cutting federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by $186 billion through 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), about 20 percent — the largest cut to SNAP in history. These cuts would increase poverty, food insecurity, and hunger, including among children. The so-called ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ is anything but beautiful; it would cause widespread harm by making massive cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, which would raise costs on families and make it much harder for them to afford the high cost of health care and groceries."

<p><strong>May 2025: Calvert Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Included $3.8 Trillion In Tax Cuts Offset By $1.5 Trillion In Spending Reductions To Programs Like Medicaid And The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</strong> In May 2025, Calvert voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would provide for approximately $3.8 trillion in net tax cuts and $321 billion in military, border enforcement and judiciary spending, offset by $1.5 trillion in spending reductions, as instructed in the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). It would raise the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion and provide for increased spending on defense and border security, spending cuts on social safety net programs, such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It also includes a mix of tax breaks for businesses and individuals; tax increases on universities and foundations; and a phase-down of clean energy tax credits. […] It would reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by requiring states to shoulder more of the cost, expand work requirements for SNAP, extend programs authorized under the 2018 farm bill, and prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Program. As amended, it would cap state and local tax deductions at $40,000 for households with incomes below $500,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 215 to 214.

  <li><strong>The House Republican Reconciliation Bill Included Nearly $300 Billion In Cuts To The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</strong>&nbsp;According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, "The House-passed Republican reconciliation plan would cut nearly $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through 2034, based on Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates — by far the largest cut to SNAP in history.[1] As a result of these cuts and other policies in the legislation — which are being used to pay partly for trillions in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy — millions of people would lose some or all of the food assistance they need to afford groceries, when many low-income households are struggling to afford the high cost of food and other basic needs."

<p><strong>February 2025: Calvert Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Framework That Included $2 Trillion In Cuts, Raised The Statutory Debt Limit By $4 Trillion, And Required House Committees To Recommend Legislation That Would Implement Trump’s Agenda.</strong> In February 2025, Calvert voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the concurrent resolution that would recommend a budget for fiscal 2025 and budget levels through fiscal 2034. The resolution would assume minimum savings of $1.5 trillion over 10 years and 2.6 percent economic growth over the same period. It also would require the statutory debt limit to be raised by $4 trillion. It also would authorize the House Ways and Means Committee to increase deficits by $4.5 trillion over 10 years to extend the 2017 tax cuts and implement new tax cuts proposed by the White House. It also would provide instructions for the budget reconciliation process through which separate legislation could be considered and passed in the Senate via a simple majority vote. The measure would deliver instructions to 11 House committees to report legislation that would implement President Donald Trump’s agenda, such as expanding tax cuts and bolstering border security and immigration enforcement. The committees would be required to report their legislative recommendations to the House Budget Committee by March 27, 2025. It also would set a $2 trillion target for the spending cuts to be submitted to the House Budget Committee. The resolution also would stipulate that if the committees don't reach that target, the Ways and Means’ reconciliation instructions to increase the deficit by a maximum of $4.5 trillion would be decreased by the amount the other committees come in below the target. Similarly, it would stipulate that Ways and Means could increase the deficit above the $4.5 trillion level by the amount of savings the committees achieve above the $2 trillion target.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 217 to 215.

  <li><strong>HEADLINE: "House Republican Budget Takes Away Health Care, Food Aid To Pay For Expanded Tax Cuts For Wealthy"</strong> [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/house-republican-budget-takes-away-health-care-food-aid-to-pay-for-expanded-tax-cuts-for">2/21/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>CBPP Said The Republican Budget Resolution Outlined $230 Billion In Cuts, Primary From SNAP Benefits.</strong>&nbsp;According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, "The House Republicans’ budget plan would give major tax cuts to high-income, wealthy households. Extending the expiring individual income and estate tax provisions for households with incomes in the top 5 percent of the income distribution (households with incomes over $321,000) costs around $1.8 trillion through 2034, accounting for 49 percent of the total $3.6 trillion cost of extension through 2034. That $1.8 trillion for wealthy and high-income households is close to the amount of the spending cuts House Republicans have outlined — including at least $880 billion primarily from Medicaid, $230 billion primarily from SNAP benefits, and $330 billion primarily from making student loans more expensive. Of the tax cuts for wealthy households, nearly $200 billion is for an estate tax giveaway that showers some $6 million per estate on the 1 in 1,000 wealthiest estates. In contrast, the average SNAP benefit is $6.20 per person per day, which helps struggling families put food on the table."&nbsp;[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/house-republican-budget-takes-away-health-care-food-aid-to-pay-for-expanded-tax-cuts-for">2/21/25</a>]</li>

<h2>Calvert Voted to Give Tax Breaks to Billionaires and Big Corporations</h2>
<p><strong>2017: Calvert Voted For The House GOP’s 2017 Tax Reform Plan Which Significantly Cut Taxes For The Rich And Corporations; Legislation Moved The Tax Rates From Seven To Four.</strong> In November 2017, Calvert voted for reconciliation legislation which significantly altered the federal tax code. According to Congressional Quarterly, “The bill substantially restructures the U.S. tax code to simplify the code and reduce taxes on individuals, corporations and small businesses.&nbsp;For individuals, it consolidates the current seven tax brackets down to four and eliminates or restricts many tax credits and deductions, including by eliminating the deduction for state and local income taxes and limiting the deduction for property taxes to $10,000 and the interest deduction for a home mortgage to the first $500,000 worth of a loan. […] On the business side, it reduces the corporate tax from 35% to 20% and establishes a ‘territorial’ tax system that would exempt most income derived overseas from U.S. corporate taxation. It allows businesses to immediately expense 100% of the cost of assets acquired and placed into service, and for small businesses it raises the Section 179 expensing limit to $5 million for five years. It also establishes a 25% rate for a portion of pass-through business income that would otherwise have to be paid at the ordinary individual tax level, and for small businesses where an individual would receive less than $150,000 in pass-through income it taxes the first $75,000 of that income at a 9% rate.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 227 to 205. President Trump later signed an amended version of the bill into law. [House Vote 637, <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll637.xml">11/16/17</a>; Congressional Quarterly, <a href="http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5217156?4">11/15/17</a>; Congressional Actions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions">H.R. 1</a>]</p>

  <li><strong>The GOP Tax Bill Included Permanent Tax Cuts For Corporations, But Not For Individuals.</strong> According to the Washington Post, The essential gamble of Republican plans to overhaul the tax code is now becoming clear: Big businesses get a large, permanent tax cut, while American families receive only temporary tax relief that expires as soon as 2023 in the House bill and 2026 in the Senate bill. In the House bill, the tax increase would mostly hit moderate and middle-income families because a credit designed to help them expires after five years. But in the Senate plan, released late Tuesday, virtually all Americans would face higher tax rates because the individual income rate cuts go away entirely in 2026. The tax cuts for corporations do not expire.” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/15/in-political-gamble-gop-gives-permanent-tax-cuts-to-corporations-but-not-people/?utm_term=.e38536be098b">11/15/17</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>By 2027, The Top One Percent Would Get 50 Percent Of The Total Benefit Of The Republican Tax Bill.</strong> According to the Tax Policy Center, “In 2027, the overall average tax cut would be smaller than in 2018, reducing taxes by about $860 on average, or 0.9 percent of after-tax income (table 2). Taxpayers in the bottom two quintiles of the income distribution (those with income less than about $55,000) would see little change in their taxes, with average tax decreases of $50 or less. Taxpayers in the middle of the income distribution would see a net tax cut on average and see their after-tax incomes increase 0.5 percent. Taxpayers in the top 1 percent would receive nearly 50 percent of the total benefit; their after-tax income would increase 2.6 percent on average.” [Tax Policy Center, <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/publication/148171/2001592-distributional-analysis-of-the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-as-passed-by-the-house-ways-and-means-committee_0.pdf">11/13/17</a>]</li>

<p><strong>2017: Calvert Voted For The Final Version Of Trump’s Tax Reform Plan, Which Substantially Cut Taxes For Rich Americans And Corporations.</strong> In December 2017, Calvert voted for the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, also known as Trump’s tax reform bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, “This Conference Summary deals with the conference report on HR 1, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the House will consider Tuesday. The agreement significantly cuts corporate and individual taxes and seeks to simply the tax code, although most individual tax provisions would expire after 2025. It reduces the corporate tax from 35% to 21% and reduces taxation of so-called ‘pass-through’ businesses where profits are taxed at the individual rate. For corporate taxes it also establishes a ‘territorial’ tax system that exempts most overseas income from U.S. taxation. Most individual tax rate rates would be reduced, including by dropping the top rate from 39.6% to 37%, and it eliminates personal exemptions but nearly doubles the standard deduction so fewer taxpayers will itemize deductions.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 227 to 203. The Senate later passed a slightly modified version of the bill, which the House later agreed to. President Trump later signed an amended version of the bill into law.

  <li><strong>In 2027, 83 Percent Of The Total Tax Benefit From The Republican Tax Bill Would Go To The Top One Percent.</strong> According to Tax Policy Center, “In 2027, the overall average tax cut would be $160, or 0.2 percent of after-tax income (table 3), largely because almost all individual income tax provisions would sunset after 2025. On average, taxes would be little changed for taxpayers in the bottom 95 percent of the income distribution. Taxpayers in the bottom two quintiles of the income distribution would face an average tax increase of 0.1 percent of after-tax income; taxpayers in the middle income quintile would see no material change on average; and taxpayers in the 95th to 99th income percentiles would receive an average tax cut of 0.2 percent of after-tax income. Taxpayers in the top 1 percent of the income distribution would receive an average tax cut of 0.9 percent of after-tax income, accounting for 83 percent of the total benefit for that year.” [Tax Policy Center, <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/publication/150816/2001641_distributional_analysis_of_the_conference_agreement_for_the_tax_cuts_and_jobs_act.pdf">12/18/17</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Last Minute Provision Added To The Republican Tax Bill Gave A Tax Break To Real-Estate Moguls.</strong> According to the International Business Times, “President Donald Trump has made tens of millions of dollars of a specific kind of income that could be subjected to a last-minute tax break inserted into the Republicans’ tax legislation released Friday, according to federal records reviewed by International Business Times. The same is true for Tennessee GOP Sen. Bob Corker — a commercial real estate mogul who suddenly switched his vote to ‘yes’ on the tax bill after the provision was added to the legislation. Previously, Corker was the only Republican to vote against the Senate version of the bill. […] The reconciled tax bill includes a new 20 percent deduction for so-called ‘pass-through’ entities, business structures such as LLCs, LPs and S-Corporations that don’t pay corporate taxes, but instead ‘pass through’ income to partners who pay individual tax rates on that money. The Senate version of the bill included safeguards that would only allow businesses to take advantage of the new break if they paid out significant wages to employees. But the new provision, which wasn’t included in either version of the bill passed by the House and Senate, and was only added during the reconciliation process, gives owners of income-producing real estate holdings a way around that safeguard, effectively creating a new tax break for large landlords and real estate moguls.” [International Business Times, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/last-minute-real-estate-tax-break-gop-bill-will-benefit-trump-2629381">12/16/17</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Republican Tax Bill Reduced Taxes For Pass-Through Companies Via A 20 Percent Deduction.</strong> According to Vox, “Pass-through companies, like the Trump Organization, which get a new deduction reducing their tax burden. The House-Senate compromise bill allows people with pass-through income to deduct a portion of that income from their taxes; the deduction is for 20 percent of pass-through income, less than the 23 percent under the Senate-passed bill.” [Vox, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/14/16773202/republican-tax-bill-reform-cuts-conference-committee-senate-house">12/18/17</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Most Of The Republican Tax Bill’s Tax Cuts For Individuals Were Temporary, But The Corporate Ones Were Permanent.</strong> According to the Washington Post, “The core of the plan is a massive and permanent cut to the corporate tax rate, dropping it from 35 percent to 21 percent. The bill also would cut individual tax rates for all income tax levels. Families earning less than $25,000 a year would receive an average tax cut of $60, while those earning more than $733,000 would see an average cut of $51,000, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Many of the breaks for individuals are set to expire in the coming years. Republicans set those expiration dates to comply with Senate limits on how much their legislation could add to the nation’s deficit, and they say a future Congress will extend the cuts or make them permanent.” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/gop-tax-bill-headed-for-quick-passage-in-house-senate-on-tuesday/2017/12/19/61f83dac-e4cf-11e7-9ec2-518810e7d44d_story.html?utm_term=.34af37ede8f0">12/20/17</a>]</li>

<h4>November 16, 2025: Trump Said House Republicans Should Vote To Release The Epstein Files</h4>
<p><strong>HEADLINE: "In A Shift, Trump Says House Republicans Should Vote To Release Epstein Files"</strong> [NPR, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/16/nx-s1-5610552/trump-house-republicans-epstein-files">11/16/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>11/16/25: Trump Said House Republicans Should Vote To Release The Epstein Files And That The House Oversight Committee Could Have Whatever It Was Legally Entitled To.</strong>&nbsp;According to Trump’s Truth Social post, "As I said on Friday night aboard Air Force One to the Fake News Media, House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown.’ The Department of Justice has already turned over tens of thousands of pages to the Public on ‘Epstein,’ are looking at various Democrat operatives (Bill Clinton, Reid Hoffman, Larry Summers, etc.) and their relationship to Epstein, and the House Oversight Committee can have whatever they are legally entitled to, I DON’T CARE! All I do care about is that Republicans get BACK ON POINT, which is the Economy, ‘Affordability’ (where we are winning BIG!), our Victory on reducing Inflation from the highest level in History to practically nothing, bringing down prices for the American People, delivering Historic Tax Cuts, gaining Trillions of Dollars of Investment into America (A RECORD!), the rebuilding of our Military, securing our Border, deporting Criminal Illegal Aliens, ending Men in Women’s Sports, stopping Transgender for Everyone, and so much more! Nobody cared about Jeffrey Epstein when he was alive and, if the Democrats had anything, they would have released it before our Landslide Election Victory. Some ‘members’ of the Republican Party are being ‘used,’ and we can’t let that happen. Let’s start talking about the Republican Party’s Record Setting Achievements, and not fall into the Epstein ‘TRAP,’ which is actually a curse on the Democrats, not us. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

<h4>November 17, 2025: Lawler Voted With Nearly Every Other Member Of The U.S. House To Release The Epstein Files</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Calvert Voted To Release The Epstein Files.</strong> In November 2025, Calvert voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would require the attorney general, within 30 days of the bill's enactment, to make publicly available all Justice Department records, documents, communications and investigation material related to the department’s investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and other individuals or entities associated with Epstein. It would require the DOJ to disclose any immunity deals or plea bargains involving Epstein or his associates. It would allow the Justice Department to withhold or redact certain materials to protect victims' privacy, among other limited exceptions. It also would require the attorney general, within 15 days of making such records public, to submit a report to Congress that includes information on the materials it has released and withheld, a list of any redactions made and the legal justification for doing so, and a list of any government officials and politically exposed persons named in the investigation.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 472 to 1 and it was ultimately signed into law by President Trump.

  <li><strong>The Justice Department Had 30 Days After Trump Signed The Bill To Release All Unclassified Documents About Jeffrey Epstein.</strong>&nbsp;According to the Washington Post, "President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he has signed a bill directing the Justice Department to release the Epstein files, documents related to the sprawling sex-trafficking investigation into the onetime powerful financier that are fervently sought by Trump’s political opponents and members of his political base.&nbsp; After Trump’s announcement, made in a social media post, the Justice Department will have 30 days to release all unclassified documents about Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested on federal sex-trafficking charges in 2019 and died in an apparent suicide while in federal custody."

  <li><strong>Speaker Johnson Sent The House Home A Day Early In July To Avoid A Vote On The Release Of The Files.</strong>&nbsp;According to ABC News, “House Speaker Mike Johnson had tried to avoid holding a vote in the lower chamber on the Epstein matter.

  <li><strong>Speaker Johnson Expressed Opposition To The Process, Saying He Was “Deeply Disappointed” In The Outcome.</strong>&nbsp;According to NBC News, “Even after having voted for the bill, Johnson was still fuming over the process hours later. Returning to the Capitol from a White House dinner honoring Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Johnson said, ‘I'm deeply disappointed in this outcome,’ and he lamented that ‘Chuck Schumer rushed it to the floor.’ Senate Majority John Thune, R-S.D., didn't object, despite being aware of Johnson's concerns. Johnson said he was continuing to have conversations with Trump about those issues. ‘I'm frustrated with the process,’ he said, ‘but I trust Leader Thune.’” [NBC News,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-bill-force-release-epstein-files-bipartisan-vote-rcna244301">11/17/25</a>]</li>

As the final vote tally in the House, 427-1, was read, several Epstein survivors who were sitting in the gallery embraced one another and loud cheers went up through the chamber. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., was the only lawmaker to vote no."

  <li><strong>H.Res.581 Called On The Justice Department To Release All Unclassified Documents That Related To Jeffrey Epstein Or Ghislaine Maxwell.</strong>&nbsp;According to <a href="http://Congress.gov">Congress.gov</a>, H.Res.581 would, "This resolution provides a special rule for consideration of H.R. 185 and amends that bill to direct the Department of Justice (DOJ) to make publicly available certain records related to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell. Under H.R. 185, as amended by the resolution, DOJ must publicly disclose all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in its possession that relate to Epstein or Maxwell. The records include unclassified records referring or relating to Epstein's detention and death; flight logs of aircraft owned or used by Epstein; individuals named in connection with Epstein’s criminal activities, civil settlements, or immunity or plea agreements; immunity deals, sealed settlements, or plea bargains of Epstein or his associates; entities with ties to Epstein’s trafficking or financial networks; and internal Department of Justice communications concerning decisions to investigate or charge Epstein or his associates.&nbsp; However, under the amended bill, DOJ may withhold or redact portions of records with written justification that such portions contain (1) victims' personally identifiable information; (2) child sexual abuse materials; (3) images of death, physical abuse, or injury; (4) information which would jeopardize an active federal investigation or prosecution; or (5) classified information. DOJ may not withhold or redact records on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity. Further, within 15 days of completing the required disclosures, DOJ must provide Congress with a report listing all categories of records released and withheld, all redactions made and their legal basis, and all government officials and politically exposed persons named or referenced in the released materials."

<h3>Calvert PREVIOUSLY voted against releasing the epstein files</h3>
<h4>September 2025: Calvert Voted Against Releasing The Epstein Files</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Calvert Effectively Voted Against Releasing The Epstein Files.</strong> In September 2025, Lawler voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “adoption of the rule [that] […] would consider as adopted a resolution (H Res 668) that would direct the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to continue its ongoing inquiry into the possible mismanagement of the federal government's investigation of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death in federal custody, sex trafficking rings and potential ethics violations by elected officials. […] It also would table a rule (H Res 598) that would provide for the adoption of a resolution (H Res 589) concerning the release of certain documents related to the Epstein case.” The vote was on the rule. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 212 to 208. [House Vote 222, <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll222.xml">9/3/25</a>; Congressional Quarterly, <a href="https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/222?2">9/3/25</a>; Congressional Actions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/672/all-actions">H.Res. 672</a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Representatives Massie And Khanna Introduced A Discharge Petition To Force A Vote On The Release Of The Files With Four Republicans Signed On To It As Of Mid-September.</strong>&nbsp;According to NBC News, “In the House, the ‘discharge petition’ to force a vote on the Massie-Khanna legislation is on track to succeed. It has 216 signatures — including all Democrats and four Republicans — and needs just two more. Those two are expected to arrive this month in the form of a newly elected Democrat in a Virginia special election and another safe blue seat in Arizona that will get a special election in late September. Massie told NBC News on Tuesday that the four Republicans who have signed on are solidly behind the effort and won’t bow to pressure to remove their names. He said other GOP lawmakers have signaled to him they are open to signing the petition but prefer not to get crosswise with Trump or party leaders publicly if their votes aren't needed to pass it.

<h4>July 2025: Calvert Was The Deciding Vote Against Releasing The Epstein Files</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Calvert Voted To Block The Release Of The Epstein Files.</strong> In July 2025, Calvert voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, the “motion to order the previous question on the rule (H Res 580) providing for floor consideration of the fiscal 2026 Defense appropriations bill (HR 4016), the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act (HR 1919), the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (HR 3633) and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act (S 1582).” The vote was on the previous question. The House agreed to the motion by a vote on of 211 to 210. [House Vote 194, <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml">7/15/25</a>; Congressional Quarterly, <a href="https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/194?4">7/15/25</a>; Congressional Actions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/580/all-actions">H. Res. 580</a>]</p>

  <li><strong>The Vote Served As A Referendum With Its Passage Blocking Consideration Of Representative Khanna’s Amendment To Require Release Of The Epstein Files.</strong>&nbsp;According to Politico, “Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) had slightly more success mounting an effort to amend cryptocurrency-related legislation scheduled to hit the House floor later this week to compel the release of Epstein-related files. Democrats forced a Rules Committee vote on whether to allow a floor vote on Khanna’s amendment; Republicans voted it down, though one Rules member in their ranks, Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, crossed party lines. On the floor Tuesday afternoon, House Democrats attempted to cast a procedural vote as a referendum on releasing the so-called Epstein files. Had their effort to vote down the motion succeeded, they said, they would have moved forward with Khanna’s amendment. But the ‘previous question’ vote, which hasn’t been won by the House minority since 1988, prevailed 211-210 on party lines.” [Politico,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/07/15/congress/jeffrey-epstein-house-democrats-struggle-00454000">7/15/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>If Rep. Ro Khanna’s Maneuver Had Been Successful It Would Have Set Aside The House Republican Majority’s Agenda For The Day In Favor Of Considering Khanna’s Legislation.</strong> According to Axios, "What happened: The House voted 211-210 against allowing a House vote on Rep. Ro Khanna's (D-Calif.) measure to force the DOJ to publish the Epstein files online within 30 days. Democrats' procedural motion would have scuttled the GOP's legislative agenda for the day in favor of the Khanna bill, making it difficult for Republicans to vote for it. The vote fell along party lines, with all Democrats who were present voting for their party's maneuver and all Republicans voting against it. It came after Republicans on the House Rules Committee voted Monday night against attaching the Epstein language to a broader cryptocurrency and defense funding vote."
