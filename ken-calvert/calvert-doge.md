## Overview

Calvert was so supportive of Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” that he wrote an [entire op-ed](https://www.ocregister.com/2025/02/12/ken-calvert-doge-is-doing-what-must-be-done-to-protect-taxpayers/) defending the effort. Calvert also provided a flippant response to constituents at his office who were protesting DOGE, saying, [“it’s just another day in paradise.”](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/24/house-republicans-protests-00205892) He did this as DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) ability to [deliver services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors.

## Calvert Defended DOGE, Which Affected Services At The Social Security Administration

### Ken Calvert Wrote An Entire Op-Ed Defending DOGE

**OPINION: "Ken Calvert: DOGE Is Doing What Must Be Done To Protect Taxpayers"** \[Rep. Ken Calvert Opinion – Orange County Register, [2/12/25](https://www.ocregister.com/2025/02/12/ken-calvert-doge-is-doing-what-must-be-done-to-protect-taxpayers/)\]

**Calvert: "I Expect The Hyperbole And Dramatics From The Left Will Only Grow More Frantic As DOGE And The Trump Administration Continues To Expose A Web Of Bureaucracy That Has Strayed Far From Their Original Mission At The Expense Of The American Taxpayer."** According to an op-ed written by Ken Calvert in the Orange County Register, "I expect the hyperbole and dramatics from the left will only grow more frantic as DOGE and the Trump administration continues to expose a web of bureaucracy that has strayed far from their original mission at the expense of the American taxpayer." \[Rep. Ken Calvert Opinion – Orange County Register, [2/12/25](https://www.ocregister.com/2025/02/12/ken-calvert-doge-is-doing-what-must-be-done-to-protect-taxpayers/)\]

**Calvert Claimed DOGE Was “Essentially Acting As Auditors” And Did Not Have Access To Private Information.** According to an op-ed written by Ken Calvert in the Orange County Register, "There has been much discussion about Elon’s role in the U.S. Treasury and his access to secure data. The U.S. Treasury has robust systems and personnel to ensure the integrity of private information and, as I understand it, Musk does not have access to any system that could change or reveal private information. Protections afforded to Americans under the federal Privacy Act remain in place.  He and the DOGE team are essentially acting as auditors and reviewing payments made by the U.S. Treasury. American taxpayers have every right to know how their hard-earned money has been spent." \[Rep. Ken Calvert Opinion – Orange County Register, [2/12/25](https://www.ocregister.com/2025/02/12/ken-calvert-doge-is-doing-what-must-be-done-to-protect-taxpayers/)\]

#### Calvert Dismissed His Constituents Protesting Him Over The Trump Administration’s Cuts

**Calvert Said Protests At His Office Did Not Change His Support For DOGE’s Cuts And Said “I’m Used To It \[…\] It’s Just Another Day In Paradise.”** According to Politico, "Others have voiced concerns about the impacts NIH funding cuts could have on research institutions in their states. Some senators have also begun urging Musk and DOGE to show more ‘compassion’ for the civil servants they’re culling en masse.  ‘We are not building trust within our own government by how the DOGE teams are operating,’ Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said. And ‘we’re seeing the Congress kind of stand back and let them overreach. That cedes our authority. … That’s not good.’ But many House Republicans don’t share her public hesitation. Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.) saw protestors gather at his Palm Desert office and said it didn’t change his support for Musk.  ‘I’m used to it,’ he said. ‘It’s just another day in paradise.’" \[Politico, [2/24/25](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/24/house-republicans-protests-00205892)\]

In the field, office managers have resorted to answering phones in place of receptionists because so many employees have been pushed out. Amid all this, the agency no longer has a system to monitor customer experience because that office was eliminated as part of the cost-cutting efforts led by Elon Musk. And the phones keep ringing. And ringing." \[Washington Post, [3/25/25](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/25/social-security-phones-doge-cuts/)\]

Social Security is the primary source of income for about 40 percent of older Americans." \[Washington Post, [3/25/25](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/25/social-security-phones-doge-cuts/)\]
