 ## When to Use the Research Agent

  If you're looking for a specific page or a single piece of information, the regular search bar is your best bet. But some questions don't have a single answer—they require pulling together information scattered across dozens of pages. That's where this tool shines. Ask it a complex question, and it will scan through the databases, gather the relevant pieces, and assemble them into a clear summary with links to the original sources. Think of it as a research assistant that can read through hundreds of pages in seconds and write you a custom briefing.
