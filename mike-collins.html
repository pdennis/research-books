<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>How To Win Against Mike Collins</strong></h1>
<p>Mike Collins is a nepo baby Internet troll, who wants to cut Medicaid, privatize Medicare, and raise the Social Security retirement age. Mike Collins ran to be a change agent but is a swampy typical politician, pushing for policies to line his own pockets. Collins ripped health care away from nearly half a million Georgians and stood by while Trump fired hardworking Atlantans and shuttered Georgia social security offices.</p>
<h3><strong>Collins Endangered Georgians’ Health Care</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>In 2025, Collins <a href="https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190"><u>voted for a bill</u></a> that is estimated to kick&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/"><u>17 million Americans</u></a>&nbsp;off their health insurance, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/"><u>nearly 12 million Americans</u></a>&nbsp;who rely on Medicaid. Collins promised that “<a href="https://x.com/RepMikeCollins/status/1930786100676562989"><u>every single American will benefit</u></a>” from the bill: more&nbsp; than <a href="https://www.kff.org/uninsured/how-will-the-2025-reconciliation-law-affect-the-uninsured-rate-in-each-state/"><u>500,000 Georgians</u></a>&nbsp;could lose their health insurance as a result of Collins’ vote.</li>
  <li>Collins <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/12/jon-ossoff-pushes-for-health-care-subsidies-as-us-senate-vote-looms/"><u>mocked</u></a> the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium subsidies as a “<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/11/georgia-republicans-in-congress-weigh-in-on-the-shutdowns-effects/"><u>failed program</u></a>” and “<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/12/jon-ossoff-pushes-for-health-care-subsidies-as-us-senate-vote-looms/"><u>short-term bandaid</u></a>;” he <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/11/georgia-republicans-in-congress-weigh-in-on-the-shutdowns-effects/"><u>opposed their extension</u></a>. An estimated <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/2025/09/report-georgia-health-sector-to-lose-37b-in-2026-as-aca-subsidies-end/"><u>460,000 Georgians</u></a> could lose their health insurance without the subsidies Collins belittled and Georgians expected their health care premiums to <a href="https://roughdraftatlanta.com/2025/12/12/rising-aca-costs-georgia/"><u>more than double</u></a>.</li>
  <li>Collins wanted to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606095339/http:/www.overhauldc.com/wp-content/plugins/google-document-embedder/load.php?d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.overhauldc.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F01%2FODC_Collins.pdf"><u>fully repeal</u></a> the Affordable Care Act, endangering over <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/pre-existing-condition-prevalence-for-individuals-and-families/"><u>1.8 million Georgians'</u></a> health care, and “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606095339/http:/www.overhauldc.com/wp-content/plugins/google-document-embedder/load.php?d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.overhauldc.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F01%2FODC_Collins.pdf"><u>raise the retirement age</u></a>” and <a href="https://x.com/MikeCollinsGA/status/453203257356451843"><u>Medicare eligibility</u></a> to 67 under <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/medicare-in-ryans-2015-budget"><u>Paul Ryan’s health care disaster</u></a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Message: </strong>Collins voted to rip away health care from thousands of Georgians to fund billionaire tax cuts.</p>
<h3><strong>Collins Cheered For Trump’s Tariffs And Dismissed His Constituents’ Pain</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Collins <a href="https://x.com/MikeCollinsGA/status/1909951942110957987"><u>praised</u></a> Trump’s trade wars and told Americans to “<a href="https://x.com/RepMikeCollins/status/1911849727236460869"><u>trust the process</u></a>” and deal with the <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/trumps-tariff-plan-sparks-economic-uncertainty-georgia"><u>fallout</u></a> from Trump’s tariffs. He minimized Georgians <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/trumps-tariff-plan-sparks-economic-uncertainty-georgia"><u>economic suffering</u></a> and claimed that <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/mike-collins-the-brian-kilmeade-show-472025/s-VtzPdetGRux?si=85debe1232fe4c8db7ef2b6207ae5a90&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>“blue collar people” do not “participate in the stock market.”</u></a> Tariffs slammed Georgians with <a href="https://atlantaciviccircle.org/2025/03/18/trump-tariffs-increase-housing-costs-atlanta/"><u>increased housing costs</u></a> and <a href="https://www.13wmaz.com/article/money/economy/grocery-store-prices-continue-climb-central-georgia-shoppers-feel-the-impacts/93-b1863f8a-bc7a-4365-95e1-ba934e11e8b0"><u>grocery bills</u></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Message: </strong>Collins backed Trump’s tariffs and trade wars to crush Georgia small businesses and ensure Georgians will pay more for groceries and housing.</p>
<h3><strong>Collins Stood By While Trump Attacked Social Security And Fired Hard-Working Georgians</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>In 2025, Collins <a href="https://x.com/MikeCollinsGA/status/1903459138207699331"><u>praised</u></a> Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” as DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive"><u>affecting</u></a> the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/"><u>federal government’s</u></a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/"><u>ability</u></a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/"><u>deliver services</u></a> to seniors. More than <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/ga.pdf"><u>1.56 million Georgians</u></a><u>&nbsp;</u> relied on Social Security benefits and Collins stood by while DOGE <a href="https://www.abc27.com/news/list-of-social-security-administration-offices-doge-is-closing/"><u>closed five of Georgia’s local SSA offices</u></a>. He <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/mike-collins-right-to-the-point-podcast-4102025/s-fB9aT28Jilo?si=38dd5c1aa3264f13b22bafe3d6330793&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>downplayed</u></a> DOGE’s federal layoffs and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/d20d9243-c5c3-412c-9364-6c4147990454/s-Bc9xajQTsqn?si=2e13607d8cda405f9b0046a6b0c7a073&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>wanted federal workers to prove they were efficient</u></a> while Trump fired over <a href="https://pro.stateaffairs.com/ga/politics/georgia-doge-federal-cuts"><u>2,300 CDC employees</u></a> in Atlanta.</li>
  <li>Collins sought to <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/republicans-call-to-repeal-clean-energy-incentives-amid-georgia-green-boom/OMGLRG7GMZFTVL5EME5IWPLTRA/"><u>repeal</u></a> clean energy incentives that created <a href="https://climatepower.us/news/new-report-more-than-400000-new-clean-energy-jobs-have-been-created-since-ira-passage/"><u>10,000 jobs</u></a> in his district and <a href="https://x.com/MikeCollinsGA/status/1425905406057062402"><u>opposed</u></a> bipartisan infrastructure investment with <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/whats-in-the-12-trillion-infrastructure-bill-for-georgia/ABB2OKOUCBBPBCD6VTUCIXOJSU/"><u>billions in funding</u></a> for Georgia.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Message: </strong>While Social Security lines grew and Georgia workers were laid off, Collins didn’t help them.</p>
<h3><strong>Collins Was An Anti-Abortion Extremist</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mike Collins was an out-of-touch anti-abortion extremist, who <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-2022-midterm-elections-health-georgia-atlanta-609f4d1eb48c414305099d8e60858a46"><u>opposed</u></a> abortion acccess, even <a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/d51b2a5e/files/uploaded/Mike-Collins-Survey-2022.pdf"><u>in cases of rape, incest, and life of the mother</u></a>, and <a href="https://x.com/RepMikeCollins/status/1672627705446117378"><u>celebrated</u></a> the downfall of Roe v.

<h3><strong>Collins Was A Swamp Creature Wannabe Who Looked Out For The Rich At The Expense Of Regular Georgians</strong></h3>

  <li>Collins was a “<a href="https://x.com/MikeCollinsGA/status/398920425842814976"><u>proud and true supporter</u></a>” of a so-called ‘Fair Tax’ and wanted to <a href="https://x.com/MikeCollinsGA/status/402953489682538496"><u>repeal</u></a> the 16th Amendment.

</ul>
<p><strong>Message:</strong> Collins went to Washington to further enrich himself and strip away protective regulations on his business.</p>
<h3><strong>Collins Voted To Release The Epstein Files After 11 Months, Only Because Trump Finally Approved Of The Release</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>It took Collins 11 months to <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml"><u>vote</u></a> for the release of the Epstein files, only after <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/16/nx-s1-5610552/trump-house-republicans-epstein-files"><u>Trump</u></a> told House Republicans he approved of the release.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Collins <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/11/georgia-lawmakers-vote-to-release-epstein-files/"><u>was tweeting</u></a> during the House’s debate on the Epstein files and wanted Americans to <a href="https://x.com/MikeCollinsGA/status/1990914996633563222"><u>move on</u></a>.

</ul>
<p><strong>Message:</strong> Despite previously voting against releasing the Epstein files, Collins ultimately voted for the release of the Epstein files only because Trump approved of the release.&nbsp;</p>
