<p><strong>2017: Bacon Said He Voted “Hell, Yes” To Repeal The Affordable Care Act. </strong>According to the Omaha World-Herald, "Abandoning negotiations, President Donald Trump late Thursday demanded a make-or-break vote on health care legislation today in the House, threatening to leave the Affordable Care Act in place and move on to other issues if the vote fails. […] While President Barack Obama’s health care law included good provisions such as guaranteed coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, Bacon said he’s also heard horror stories about Nebraskans hurt by the law. As Bacon emerged from the meeting, he said it included great speeches calling for unity. He reiterated his strong support for the GOP bill. ‘I’ve changed my vote, from ‘yes’ to ‘hell, yes,’’ Bacon said."

  <li><strong>2022: Bacon Voted Against The Inflation Reduction Act. </strong>In August 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Bacon voted against concurring in the Senate amendment to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which would “require the Health and Human Services Department to negotiate a ‘maximum fair price’ with drug manufacturers for certain Medicare-eligible, brand-name drugs that do not have generic competition.” The vote was on a motion to concur. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote 220-207, thus the bill was sent to President Biden for final signage. President Biden signed the bill and it ultimately became law.
