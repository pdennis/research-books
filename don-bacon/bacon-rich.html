<h2><strong>Bacon Supported Extending The 2017 Trump Tax Cuts That Disproportionately Benefitted Big Corporations And The Wealthy</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Bacon Voted For The 2017 Trump Tax Cuts For Wealthy Americans And big Corporations</strong></h3>
<p><strong>2017: Bacon Voted For The Final Version Of Trump’s Tax Reform Plan, Which Substantially Cut Taxes For Rich Americans And Corporations.</strong> In December 2017, Bacon voted for the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, also known as Trump’s tax reform bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, “This Conference Summary deals with the conference report on HR 1, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the House will consider Tuesday. The agreement significantly cuts corporate and individual taxes and seeks to simply the tax code, although most individual tax provisions would expire after 2025. It reduces the corporate tax from 35% to 21% and reduces taxation of so-called ‘pass-through’ businesses where profits are taxed at the individual rate. For corporate taxes it also establishes a ‘territorial’ tax system that exempts most overseas income from U.S. taxation. Most individual tax rate rates would be reduced, including by dropping the top rate from 39.6% to 37%, and it eliminates personal exemptions but nearly doubles the standard deduction so fewer taxpayers will itemize deductions.” The vote was on a motion to concur with the Senate amendment, effectively on passage. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill by a vote of 224 to 201. President Trump signed the bill into law.

That’s everybody’s right.’" [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/13/trumps-trip-hill-highlights-endorsement-split/"><u>6/13/24</u></a>]</p>
<h3><strong>Bacon Supported The 2017 Trump Tax Cuts Because it Reduced Corporate Taxes&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>2025: Bacon Said His Vote For The 2017 Trump Tax Cuts Was Easy Because He Supported Reducing Corporate Taxes.</strong> According to Nebraska Public Media, "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), signed into law by President Donald Trump during his first term, overhauled the U.S. tax code. According to the Tax Foundation, the TCJA moved the U.S. to a ‘territorial’ system of business taxation. It increased the standard deduction and reduced the corporate income tax rate, among other provisions. ‘When we did this in 2017, a lot of folks said ‘This is a tough vote for you.’ It was not,’ Bacon said. ‘Reducing corporate taxes from 35% to 21%, that was the world's average. We want to compete. We pay a much higher rate. Companies move overseas. We want them here.’" [Nebraska Public Media, <a href="https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/es/news/news-articles/nebraska-congressman-meets-with-omaha-business-owners-to-discuss-tax-provisions/"><u>5/2/25</u></a>]</p>
