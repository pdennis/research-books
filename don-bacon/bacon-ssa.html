<p><strong>2024: Bacon Shared A Video Of Ben Shapiro Arguing For Privatizing Social Security And Raising The Retirement Age.</strong> According to a video posted by @toottootchoo and reposted by Don Bacon’s Twitter account, “BEN SHAPIRO: I’m not sure what Project 2025’s position on Social Security is. I’m in favor of the restructuring of Social Security along the lines of privatization and lowering, and and—increasing the retirement age, because you, as well as every other congressperson knows social security is going to go bankrupt and yet everyone seems to have an interest in lying about it for the next decade and a half until we have to take austerity measures or radically increase inflation or taxes.”&nbsp;</p>
