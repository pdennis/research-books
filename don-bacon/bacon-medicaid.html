<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Despite urging House Republican leadership to not make large spending cuts to Medicaid, Bacon voted for the U.S. House budget framework that directed the House Energy and Commerce Committee to make $880 billion in cuts. It has been widely reported that House Republicans would have to cut Medicaid in order to achieve that goal. Bacon initially claimed concerns about the proposed Medicaid cuts were “hysteria” but later admitted that $880 billion in cuts would affect Medicaid. Then in April 2025, Bacon said he would accept $500 billion in cuts to Medicaid. An estimated 78,600 or nearly 14 percent of Nebraskans in Bacon’s district relied on Medicaid or CHIP for health insurance.</p>
<h2><strong>2025: Bacon Voted For $880 Billion In Cuts To Medicaid</strong></h2>
<p><strong>2025: DESPITE URGING GOP LEADERSHIP NOT TO ENACT LARGE SPENDING CUTS TO MEDICAID, BACON VOTED FOR THE HOUSE BUDGET FRAMEWORK THAT SET UP $880 BILLION IN CUTS TO MEDICAID</strong></p>
<p><strong>January 2025: Bacon Implored GOP Leadership Not To Pursue Large Spending Cuts To The Affordable Care Act, Medicaid Or SNAP. </strong>According to Politico, "House Republicans in competitive districts warned GOP leaders Thursday: We could lose our seats if you gut Obamacare to pay for a massive border, energy and tax bill. A group of about a dozen centrist Republicans delivered the message in a meeting with GOP Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and other senior lawmakers, according to four Republicans familiar with the meeting who were granted anonymity to speak frankly. GOP members are already concerned that they’re poised to lose their trifecta and a swath of seats in the 2026 midterms — they worry GOP efforts to pare back the Affordable Care Act could pour fuel on the fire. Centrists conveyed to leaders in the meeting that they needed to ‘learn the lessons’ from the last GOP attempt to undercut the Affordable Care Act in 2017, according to one of the Republicans. The party went on to lose more than 40 House seats in the 2018 midterms. Instead, they argued, Republicans needed to embrace the GOP’s role as the working class party. Leaders would counter that message by slashing programs working Americans rely on, they said. GOP lawmakers in the room included Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Young Kim (Calif.), David Valadao (Calif.), Andrew Garbarino (N.Y.), Tom Barrett (Mich.) and Don Bacon (Neb.)."

<p><strong>February 2025: Despite Previously Claiming The Republican Budget Proposal’s Cuts To Medicaid Were Too Significant, Bacon Said He Voted For It Because He Was “Assured That The Final Bill Will Not Affect The Quality Of Healthcare Covered By Medicaid.”</strong> According to Nebraska Public Media, News, "The resolution calls for the House Energy and Commerce committee to cut around $880 billion by 2034. Some fear a chunk of that would come out of Medicaid funding.&nbsp; While the resolution doesn’t directly mention cuts to Medicaid, the Energy and Commerce committee oversees the program. One initial holdout to the resolution was Nebraska’s second district Congressman Don Bacon. He told Nebraska Public Media News earlier this month he thought the size of the cut was too significant. ‘The experts that I have been talking to think you can only do that by significantly cutting Medicaid, and we have a lot of people depend on Medicaid,’ he said in an interview on Feb. 20.&nbsp; A total of 54% of Nebraskans voted for a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid in 2018. Nebraskans at or under 138% of the federal poverty line are eligible, amounting to at or below $21,600 a year for a single person, or $44,400 for a family of four.&nbsp; But Bacon did vote to approve the resolution and said in a written statement after the vote he was ‘assured that the final bill will not affect the quality of healthcare covered by Medicaid.’" [Nebraska Public Media, <a href="https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/nebraskas-house-representatives-vote-to-approve-budget-that-some-fear-would-hurt-medicaid/"><u>2/26/25</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>New York Times Reported The $880 Billion In Cuts Required By The Republican Budget Proposal Would Have To Come From Medicaid, Medicare, Or CHIP. </strong>According to the New York Times, "The budget resolution itself is silent on whether Congress cuts Medicaid, which provides health coverage to 72 million poor and disabled Americans. But it instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the program, to cut spending by $880 billion over the next decade. If the committee can’t save at least that much, the entire effort could be imperiled because of the special process Congress is using to avoid a Senate filibuster. Ten other committees have their own instructions to follow, though none have been assigned with cutting nearly as much.&nbsp; It’s not so simple as finding the cuts elsewhere. The special process, known as budget reconciliation, means Republicans will have to find all $880 billion from within the Energy and Commerce Committee’s jurisdiction. That leaves them with fewer options than one might think. […] If Republicans want to avoid major cuts to Medicaid, the largest pot of available money is in the other big government health insurance program: Medicare. […] Even if the committee cuts everything that’s not health care to $0, it will still be more than $600 billion short.&nbsp; The committee could also save around $200 billion by eliminating the Children’s Health Insurance Program, but that option has not been raised by the budget committee or anyone in House leadership. […] Even if all of these cuts, revenues and rule cancellations from outside health care can pass muster, the committee will still be left with hundreds of billions of dollars to cut to hit its goal. Mathematically, the budget committee’s instructions mean the committee would need to make major cuts to either Medicare, Medicaid or both."

<p><strong>Bacon: “You're Right. If The Final Numbers Are $880 Billion Out Of ENC. I Think You're Right, It Would Affect Medicaid.”</strong> According to an interview Rep. Don Bacon gave on PBS NewsHour, “ANCHOR: And you did say, according to reports, there are no threats right now to the stability of Medicaid, which people asked about. Mathematically, sir, you know, there's no way to reach the target cuts that have been set in the budget by that committee. other than touching Medicaid, it has to be touched in some way. So how can you guarantee that the hundreds of thousands of people in Nebraska will not feel any impact to Medicaid? BACON: You're right. If the final numbers are $880 billion out of ENC. I think you're right, it would affect Medicaid.” [PBS NewsHour, <a href="https://x.com/American_Bridge/status/1914116690134118759"><u>3/26/25</u></a>] (video)</p>
