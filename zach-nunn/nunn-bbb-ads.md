## Overview

After voting to cut health care and food assistance for Iowans, Zach Nunn cut [“slick”](https://thehill.com/homenews/5464931-zach-nunn-promotes-trump-tax-bill/) [digital ads](https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/08/21/nunn-touts-big-beautiful-laws-tax-cuts-in-new-ad-prompting-democrat-criticism/) using taxpayer-funds promoting his support of the bill that made the cuts. In total he spent $12,000 of Iowan’s hard-earned taxpayer money on the ads. The Hill noted that the ads, despite being made by his official office, had [“more of a campaign ad feel”](https://thehill.com/homenews/5464931-zach-nunn-promotes-trump-tax-bill/) from their production.

One of the ads [featured](https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/08/21/nunn-touts-big-beautiful-laws-tax-cuts-in-new-ad-prompting-democrat-criticism/) a woman who did not live in Nunn’s district and who worked for Iowans for Tax Relief, a group whose PAC had donated to Nunn’s state legislative campaigns.

Zach Nunn (R-Iowa) is taking a novel approach to selling the ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’ in his district: Using his official office funds on a slick digital video ad campaign to promote key tax pieces of the legislation.  One 30-second ad launching Friday, first previewed to The Hill, features server Erika Pirtle from Whisky River Bar & Grill in Ankeny, Iowa, talking about the benefits of the megalaw that exempts tips from being taxed." \[The Hill, [8/22/25](https://thehill.com/homenews/5464931-zach-nunn-promotes-trump-tax-bill/)\]

Zach Nunn (R-Iowa) is taking a novel approach to selling the ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’ in his district: Using his official office funds on a slick digital video ad campaign to promote key tax pieces of the legislation. \[…\] That comes from his official taxpayer-funded office funds, not campaign funds — despite the video’s production giving it more of a campaign ad feel.” \[The Hill, [8/22/25](https://thehill.com/homenews/5464931-zach-nunn-promotes-trump-tax-bill/)\]

**Nunn’s First Ad Promoting The Republican Budget Bill Featured Sarah Curry, Who The Ad Touted As Someone Who Supported An Expansion Of The Child Tax Credit And Trump’s 2017 Tax Giveaways.** According to the Iowa Capital Dispatch, "Nunn’s first testimony ad, titled ‘Tax Relief for Iowa Families,’ was unveiled Wednesday. It features Sarah Curry, an Iowan who said the expansion of the Child Tax Credit through the budget reconciliation law from $2,000 to $2,200, as well as the tax cuts during Trump’s first term in office, have helped her family.  ‘Our kids have needs that we have to meet, and every dollar we can save on our taxes means another dollar we can invest in our family to help our children,’ she said in the ad.  Nunn said he met Curry when she testified before the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee in 2024, when the GOP-led panel held a hearing at the Iowa State Fair with Iowans who spoke largely in favor of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The ad was filmed at the 2025 Iowa State Fair, where Nunn said he reconnected with the Curry family." \[Iowa Capital Dispatch, [8/21/25](https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/08/21/nunn-touts-big-beautiful-laws-tax-cuts-in-new-ad-prompting-democrat-criticism/)\]

**Sarah Curry, Who Was Featured In Nunn’s Official Digital Ad, Did Not Live In Nunn’s District.** According to the Iowa Capital Dispatch, "But Democratic organizers say the ad does not disclose crucial information about Curry. Curry works as the research director for Iowans for Tax Relief, an organization that advocates for tax cuts. The organization has an affiliated Political Action Committee that contributed $14,000 to Nunn’s state legislative campaigns between 2014 and 2020, according to data from the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board.  Curry also lives in Glenwood — a city in Iowa’s 4th Congressional District, represented by U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra — and is not a direct constituent of Nunn." \[Iowa Capital Dispatch, [8/21/25](https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/08/21/nunn-touts-big-beautiful-laws-tax-cuts-in-new-ad-prompting-democrat-criticism/)\]

**Nunn’s Official Ad Did Not Disclose That Sarah Curry Was The Research Director For Iowans For Tax Relief, Which Was Affiliated With A PAC That Had Donated To Nunn’s Campaign In The Past.** According to the Iowa Capital Dispatch, "But Democratic organizers say the ad does not disclose crucial information about Curry.
