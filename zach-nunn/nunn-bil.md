## Overview

Nunn claimed the [Bipartisan Infrastructure Law](https://www.ottumwacourier.com/news/nunn-focuses-on-urban-rural-balance/article_f94e7384-b9b3-11ec-bcb9-f722e250a7c3.html) was an example of how [“Washington has really forgotten the heartland”](https://www.crestonnews.com/adair-county-free-press/2021/11/24/us-congress-hopeful-zach-nunn-campaigns-in-greenfield/) even though Iowa was set to [receive billions of dollars](https://www.axios.com/local/des-moines/2021/11/16/biden-infrastructure-bill-iowa-roads-bridge-repairs) to repair bridges, roads, and for broadband development projects. That was something Iowa desperately needed as it was [ranked as the number one state](https://artbabridgereport.org/) with the largest number of bridges in poor condition.

## Nunn Opposed A Bipartisan Effort To Repair Bridges In Iowa

### Nunn Opposed Infrastructure Investments When Iowa Was Ranked the Worst in The Nation for Bridges in Poor Condition

**2022: Nunn Criticized The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.** According to the Ottumwa Courier, "Nunn found issues with the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which will give the state approximately $3.4 billion to improve highways and $432 million for bridge repairs. Other funding will aid in the expansion of broadband, improve water infrastructure and public transportation. Only Axne and Sen. Chuck Grassley approved the bill among the state's congressional delegation. ‘First off, Iowa has made good investment in infrastructure,’ he said. ‘What we didn't do is shotgun out trillions of dollars that drove up the cost of construction material that made supply chins highly stretched in the middle of a pandemic." \[Ottumwa Courier, [4/12/22](https://www.ottumwacourier.com/news/nunn-focuses-on-urban-rural-balance/article_f94e7384-b9b3-11ec-bcb9-f722e250a7c3.html)\]

-   **Nunn Claimed The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Was An Example Of How “Washington Has Really Forgotten The Heartland.”** According to the Creston News Advertiser, "Two things that Nunn says he is passionate about are what we do in Iowa and how leaders can make Washington, D.C. more like it. The other is the handling of the United States’ withdraw from Afghanistan. ‘This district \[for Congress, that was just redrawn\] is the most competitive it’s ever been,’ Nunn said. ‘It has a 3+ Republican lean. A couple of things that fire me up are that Washington has really forgotten the heartland \[as seen in the recent $1 trillion infrastructure bill, pressure put on small businesses with mandates against employees, and tax increases\].’" \[Creston News Advertiser, [11/24/21](https://www.crestonnews.com/adair-county-free-press/2021/11/24/us-congress-hopeful-zach-nunn-campaigns-in-greenfield/)\] 

#### Iowa Was Set To Receive Billions Of Dollars To Repair Bridges And Roads And Build Broadband As A Result Of The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law

**Iowa Was Set To Receive Billions Of Dollars For Bridges, Roads, And Broadband Development Projects From The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.** According to Axios Des Moines, "Billions of dollars in federal funding for bridges, roads, broadband and more will flow to Iowa under the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that President Joe Biden signed into law Monday.  Why it matters: Roughly 19% of Iowa's nearly 24,000 bridges are in poor or worse condition, according to federal inspection reports.  When it comes to overall number of bridges in poor condition, Iowa ranks #1 worst in the nation, according to a 2021 report by The American Road & Transportation Builders Association." \[Axios Des Moines, [11/16/21](https://www.axios.com/local/des-moines/2021/11/16/biden-infrastructure-bill-iowa-roads-bridge-repairs)\]

### Iowa Was Ranked #1 As The State With The Most Bridges in Poor Condition

**2025: Iowa Was Still Ranked #1 Out Of All 50 States As The State With The Most Bridges In Poor Condition.** As of 2025, according to the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, Iowa was ranked #1 out of all 50 states for bridges in poor condition. \[American Road & Transportation Builders Association, State Rankings, Viewed [9/22/25](https://artbabridgereport.org/state/ranking)\] 

**2021: Iowa Ranked Number One In States With The Largest Number Of Bridges In Poor Condition.** According to the American Road & Transportation Builders Association "The states with the largest number of bridges in poor condition are: 1. Iowa: 4,571 bridges (2019: Ranked #1)" \[American Road & Transportation Builders Association, Bridge Conditions Report, [2021](https://artbabridgereport.org/reports/2021-ARTBA-Bridge-Report.pdf)\]
