# **How To Win Against Rob Bresnahan**

Rob Bresnahan sold a blue-collar brand but governs like just another rich guy who profits from the swamp. He repeatedly promised that he would protect the benefits his neighbors relied on then voted to kick thousands of Pennsylvanians off their health coverage. He was the deciding vote to protect Trump’s tariffs even as local employers warned of price spikes. He played games on DOGE while Social Security backlogs grew. He broke his own pledge to ban congressional stock trading and bought a secret helicopter. The bottom line: he gets rich while he leaves NEPA behind.

### promises made, promises broken: the bresnahan way

-   Bresnahan [repeatedly](https://heartlandsignal.com/2025/02/26/rob-bresnahan-breaks-pledge-votes-to-gut-medicaid-and-snap/) [promised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wb4Pwy0n_w) that he [would not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5RryH4_Q1Q) gut the benefits his neighbors relied on. Then [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that would kick [17 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including nearly [12 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off of Medicaid. More than [30,000 Pennsylvanians](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) in his district could lose their health coverage as a result of his vote.
-   Bresnahan [repeatedly](https://broadandliberty.com/2024/07/30/rob-bresnahan-ensuring-the-future-of-social-security-and-medicare-for-northeast-pennsylvania/) [promised](https://bresnahan.house.gov/media/press-releases/bresnahan-statement-budget-reconciliation) that he would protect Medicare and would not vote for a bill that gutted the benefits his neighbors relied on. Then he [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml) for a bill that would [trigger $500 billion in cuts to Medicare](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/).
-   Bresnahan also [promised](https://x.com/Rob4PA/status/1832031067273855429) to [protect](https://broadandliberty.com/2024/07/30/rob-bresnahan-ensuring-the-future-of-social-security-and-medicare-for-northeast-pennsylvania/) Social Security. Then, he claimed the Trump administration was [taking care of America](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rVLmS_JudVA) despite acknowledging he had to [clean up](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OWTX43sO3xQ) some of the “Department of Government Efficiency’s” messes. He even [dumped](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook-remaking-government/2025/04/02/musks-day-of-reckoning-00266772) his Tesla stock at the height of DOGE’s chaos. DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) ability to [deliver services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. [More than _193,000 Pennsylvanians_](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/pa.pdf) in Bresnahan’s district relied on Social Security benefits.
-   Bresnahan [repeatedly](https://dailycaller.com/2025/03/10/house-republicans-biden-legacy-climate-law-ira/) [promised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YmlgnhVGss) to [protect](https://www.eenews.net/articles/defenders-of-climate-law-tax-credits-outline-their-demands/) [clean energy](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/13-house-republicans-urge-senate-scale-back-clean-energy-cuts-bill-vot-rcna211516) [tax credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP2HT2ix3YE) created by the Inflation Reduction Act, but then [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) to [repeal](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/climate/congress-bill-energy.html) them and roll them back with his support of the Republican budget bill. Bresnahan’s votes not only [threatened jobs](https://underthreat.seia.org/threat/#jobs) in his district, but [one report](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-passes-senate-megabill-trump-ira-tax-credit/752276/) estimated the cuts could increase U.S. household and business energy costs by $28 billion annually in 2030. Bresnahan also [supported](https://www.thetimes-tribune.com/2025/03/02/lawmakers-area-stakeholders-discuss-environmental-issues-impacting-nepa/) the [fossil fuel industry](https://www.wvia.org/news/local/2025-03-04/officials-meet-with-epa-administrator-at-poconos-roundtable) while personally holding [more than $167,000 in stock](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2024/10066455.pdf) in 20 fossil fuel companies.

**Message:** Bresnahan's time in congress is full of broken promises. He promised he would protect Medicaid and Medicare then voted to cut both. He promised he would protect clean energy tax credits that created jobs, then he voted to cut them. He promised he would protect Social Security, then supported an agenda that destroyed services. He can't be trusted to do what's right for NEPA. 

### Bresnahan Sided with Big Pharma Over Pennsylvanians

-   Bresnahan [opposed](https://keystonenewsroom.com/2024/08/26/rob-bresnahan-drug-costs/) the Inflation Reduction Act, which lowered prescription drug costs and capped the cost of insulin at $35/hour for seniors. More than [450,000 Pennsylvanians](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ira-rx-prices-pennsylvania.pdf) took prescription drugs that had been selected for price negotiation under the law’s provisions.

**Message:** Bresnahan sided with big pharma over cheaper prescription drugs for NEPA seniors. 

### Bresnahan Sided with Trump’s Tariffs Over Pennsylvanians

-   Bresnahan told Pennsylvania businesses that were concerned about Trump’s tariffs to [“rip the Band-Aid off” and “persevere.”](https://www.standardspeaker.com/2025/04/04/congressmen-meuser-bresnahan-talk-tariffs-taxes/) Then he voted three times to protect the tariffs, including in April 2025 when he was the [deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect them, dooming Pennsylvania families who relied on him to a trade war and [rising prices](https://www.wnep.com/article/news/local/lackawanna-county/impact-of-new-tariffs-on-clothing-industry-scranton-lackawanna-county/523-68b0e9c4-b454-479e-be8d-7790544f0bd8). Tariffs are contributing to [higher food prices](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi), sparked concern at a [local school district](https://www.standardspeaker.com/2025/04/14/hazleton-area-seeks-to-buy-3500-computers-before-tariffs-add-to-cost/), and Pennsylvania businesses are [warning](https://6abc.com/post/trump-tariffs-small-businesses-warn-price-hike-everyday-items-food-electronics-alcohol/17432575/) they may have to [raise prices](https://pennsylvaniaindependent.com/economy/what-trump-tariffs-mean-for-pennsylvania-breweries/). 

Message: Bresnahan chose politics over affordable groceries and made NEPA families eat the cost. 

### Stock Trading And Secret Helicopters: Bresnahan Is Just Another Rich Guy Who Wanted To Join The Swamp

-   Before getting elected, Bresnahan [promised](https://www.republicanherald.com/2024/03/29/candidate-offers-policies-to-restore-trust-in-congress/) to end congressional stock trading, but after he got elected he became one of the [most prolific stock traders](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/congress-stock-trading-ban.html) in the House. It took him [months](https://www.timesleader.com/news/1695841/rep-bresnahan-introduces-legislation-to-ban-stock-trades) to introduce his own stock trading ban despite one [already existing](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/congress-stock-trading-ban.html) that he could have signed onto. When he was asked if he would just stop trading, he scoffed and suggested he would [“go broke”](https://www.wvia.org/news/local/2025-07-31/bresnahan-says-house-rules-thwart-plan-to-put-stock-other-investments-in-blind-trust) even though his net worth was [estimated](https://keystonenewsroom.com/2025/08/19/bresnahan-billionaire-donor-reveal/) to be up to $69 million. 
-   Bresnahan [promised](https://www.timesleader.com/news/1695841/rep-bresnahan-introduces-legislation-to-ban-stock-trades) that he would put his assets into a blind trust, then claimed it was [hard](https://www.wvia.org/news/local/2025-07-31/bresnahan-says-house-rules-thwart-plan-to-put-stock-other-investments-in-blind-trust), and [wouldn’t say](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/lawmakers-congress-stock-trading-ban-3a93dc59) whether he would follow through on his promise. 
-   Multimillionaire Bresnahan also [secretly purchased](https://www.notus.org/congress/rob-bresnahan-private-helicopter) a personal helicopter that retailed for up to $1.5 million. He purchased the helicopter through one of his LLCs. He even [sits](https://transportation.house.gov/subcommittees/subcommittee/?ID=107417) on the aviation subcommittee that regulates the use of planes and helicopters.
-   Bresnahan tells the story of [running a family business](https://seventy.org/2024-voter-guide/2024-voter-guide5/rob-bresnahan), but what he leaves out is that before he started running for congress he [sold the company to a private equity firm](https://caifunds.com/cai-announces-first-close-of-seventh-fund-and-first-transaction-midwestern-electrics-partnership-with-kuharchik-construction/), which are known for [cutting jobs](https://whyy.org/articles/crozer-health-delaware-county-closes/), [closing businesses](https://www.wpxi.com/news/local/charleroi-glass-plant-open-generations-close-friday/GYLZ4BKIJFHERH722NEXJGONNI/), and [leaving Pennsylvania workers stranded](https://penncapital-star.com/energy-environment/private-equity-kept-aging-homer-city-plant-open-then-closed-it-with-no-plan-for-the-community/). 

**Message:** Bresnahan is just another out-of-touch millionaire who profits from the swamp. He offered NEPA families nothing but empty promises while he gets rich and hides luxury toys.

### it took Bresnahan 11 months to vote to release the epstein files and he did only after trump gave republicans permission

-   In November 2025, after 11 months, Bresnahan finally [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml) to release the Epstein files, but only after [Donald Trump gave House Republicans permission](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115562626931599548) to do so. Previously, Bresnahan had [cast the deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml) against [releasing the Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj), protecting the accused pedophiles named within them. Bresnahan never [signed](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209) the discharge petition that called for their release and he never [co-sponsored](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581/cosponsors?pageSort=alphaByParty) Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna’s resolution calling for their release. 

**Message:** It took Bresnahan 11 months to vote to release the Epstein files and he did only after Trump gave Republicans permission.
