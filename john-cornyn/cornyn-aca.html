<h2><strong>Cornyn Railed Against The Affordable Care Act And Sought To Repeal The Plan With No Alternative</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Cornyn Played An “Instrumental Role” In Legislative Efforts to Repeal&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Cornyn Played An “Instrumental Role” In The 2017 Attempt To Repeal The Affordable Care Act. </strong>According to the San Antonio Express News, “Cornyn has an instrumental role in writing and working out the kinks in the health care bill along with the state's other senator, Ted Cruz. As Senate majority whip, Cornyn ensures there are enough votes to pass legislation by stringing together alliances within the Republican caucus.” [San Antonio Express News, <a href="https://www.expressnews.com/news/healthcare/article/For-some-San-Antonians-battle-over-Obamacare-11287841.php"><u>7/14/17</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Politco: Cornyn Faced “His Toughest Test” As The “Chief Vote-Counter For The Senate GOP: Rounding Up 50 Votes To Dismantle Obamacare.” </strong>According to Politico, “Senate Republicans are in a grumpy mood these days. Then there’s John Cornyn, who’s almost unfailingly optimistic about the GOP’s chances of passing its Obamacare repeal bill despite the increasingly long odds. […] Whether he’s wringing his hands in private is another matter, but the Texas Republican is facing his toughest test yet in his 4 1/2 years as chief vote-counter for the Senate GOP: rounding up 50 votes to dismantle Obamacare.” [Politico, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/16/john-cornyn-gop-health-care-bill-salesman-240593"><u>7/16/17</u></a>]</p>

<p><strong>Politico: Cornyn “Emerged As The Chief Salesman For The GOP’s Beleaguered Health Care Plan.” </strong>According to Politico, “With Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell typically tight-lipped, Cornyn has emerged as a chief salesman for the GOP’s beleaguered health care plan.” [Politico, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/16/john-cornyn-gop-health-care-bill-salesman-240593"><u>7/16/17</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Cornyn Held Private Meetings With Wavering Senators To Try And Convince Them To Back The Attempt To Repeal The Affordable Care Act. </strong>According to Politico, “He’s held private one-on-one meetings with a slew of wavering senators to try to persuade them to back the party’s controversial bill, which would overhaul one-sixth of the U.S. economy and could mean that more than 20 million fewer Americans have health insurance. Cornyn said his offerings are not “state-specific” deals to convince the likes of Nevada Sen. Dean Heller or Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, although the latest drafts of the bill include some carve-outs for Florida, Alaska and Louisiana.” [Politico, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/16/john-cornyn-gop-health-care-bill-salesman-240593"><u>7/16/17</u></a>]</p>
<h3><strong>Cornyn Supported 2017 Affordable Care Act Repeal Measures</strong></h3>
<p><strong>2017: Cornyn Endorsed The Graham-Cassidy Bill To Repeal The Affordable Care Act. </strong>According to the Houston Chronicle, “U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, gave a strong endorsement of the latest plan, saying the concept of block granting money back to states would benefit Texas. ‘Texans will benefit in a dramatic sort of way,’ Cornyn said. The Graham-Cassidy bill is already in a tough spot after Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., announced on Twitter that he will oppose the bill, just like he disapproved an earlier attempt to repeal ObamaCare that failed in the Senate last month.” [Houston Chronicle, <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/health/article/Cruz-still-on-fence-on-health-care-repeal-12225295.php"><u>9/24/17</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Cornyn Supported The “Skinny Repeal” Version Of Trumpcare</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2017: Cornyn Voted For The So Called “Skinny Repeal” Version Of Trumpcare Which Among Other Things, Repealed The Individual Mandate, Repealed The Employer Mandate Through 2024 And Defunded Planned Parenthood For One Year.</strong> In July 2017, Cornyn voted for the Health Care Freedom Act, also known as “skinny repeal.” According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have “repeal[ed] the individual mandate, repeal[ed] the employer mandate through 2024, delay[ed] the implementation of the medical device tax through 2020, and block[ed], for one year, federal funding from going to certain medical providers that provide abortions. The amendment would [have] ease[d] the waiver process for states to opt out of the requirement that their health insurance providers include certain benefits on their health care plans. Additionally, the amendment would [have] increase[d] the maximum allowable contribution to health savings accounts and would defund the Prevention and Public Health Fund starting in 2019.” The vote was on the amendment. The Senate rejected the amendment by a vote of 49 to 51.

  <li><strong>Some Republicans Said That The Purpose Of The Amendment Was To Move The ACA Repeal Process Forward. According to Vox, “Senate Republicans have framed this bill as a vehicle to simply move the health care process toward further negotiations with the House. But it doesn’t read like that at all. It reads like one meant to woo conservative Republicans. It makes careful tweaks to provisions to defund Planned Parenthood and allow states more flexibility, meant to comport with strict reconciliation rules. These are key issues that House Republicans in the conservative Freedom Caucus, for example, have raised that are reflected in this new draft.” [Vox, </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/27/16054114/health-care-freedom-act-hcfa-obamacare-repeal"><strong><u>7/27/17</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
