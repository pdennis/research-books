<h2><strong>Cornyn Voted To Benefit Large Corporations And Hurt The Middle Class With The Trump Tax Cuts</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>2025: Cornyn Wanted To Renew Trump’s Tax Cuts&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Cornyn Met With Trump “To Discuss Extending The Trump Tax Cuts” And Claimed That Senate Republicans Were “United With The President To Deliver For Americans.”</strong> Senator John Cornyn tweeted, “Great meeting with @POTUS today to discuss extending the Trump Tax Cuts &amp; ensuring that taxes are not increased for millions of Americans. Senate Republicans are united with the President to deliver for Americans 🇺🇸.” [Twitter, @JohnCornyn, <a href="https://x.com/JohnCornyn/status/1907544352475271366"><u>4/2/25</u></a>]</p>

<p><strong>Cornyn Said That Trump’s Tax Cuts Benefitted “Working Families,” Who He Claimed Would “Face A $1,500 Tax Increase Next Year” If The Cuts Weren’t Extended.</strong> According to a press release from Senator John Cornyn, “‘Our Democratic colleagues, some of them have been claiming that extending these tax cut provisions… will benefit the very rich at the expense of the rest of us.’ ‘It’s almost as if there is a concerted or orchestrated effort to use disinformation and propaganda to try to prejudice the American people against what it is we need to do in order to avoid this huge tax increase on the vast majority of Americans.’ [...] ‘The reason why Republicans won the majority in both houses and President Trump was reelected is because he connected with the concerns of everyday Americans, and particularly their concerns about the overspending and inflation. Not to mention the border.’ ‘If Congress fails to extend the Trump Tax Cuts that expire at the end of this year, the average family of four making $75,000 a year will face a $1,500 tax increase next year. Working families will see the child tax credit cut in half.’”&nbsp; [Press Release – Senator John Cornyn, <a href="https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/news/video-cornyn-exposes-democrat-propaganda-on-trump-tax-cuts/"><u>3/10/25</u></a>]</p>

<h4><strong><u>Cornyn Voted For Trump Tax Reform&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2017: Cornyn Voted For The Senate GOP’s Tax Reform Bill, Which Substantially Cut Taxes For Corporations And The Rich, And Repealed The Individual Mandate.</strong> In December 2017, Cornyn voted for the Senate’s version of Trump’s tax reform bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, “Passage of the bill, as amended, that would revise the federal income tax system by lowering individual and corporate tax rates, repealing various deductions through 2025, specifically by eliminating the deduction for state and local income taxes through 2025, increasing the deduction for pass-through entities and raising the child tax credit through 2025. It would also open parts of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling.” The vote was on passage. The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 51 to 49. President Trump later signed an amended version of the bill into law.

<h4><strong><u>Cornyn Opposed Requiring The Trump Tax Bill To Get A CBO Score Prior To Consideration</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2017: Cornyn Voted Against Requiring Senate Amendments To Reconciliation Bills Receive A CBO Score At Least 28 Hours Prior To Consideration.</strong> In October 2017, Cornyn voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, “eliminate[d] the prohibition in the Senate on consideration of amendments to reconciliation legislation that would cause a net increase in the deficit unless fully offset and would [have] require[d] certain amendments to reconciliation legislation to have an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office posted on the CBO’s website no later than 28 hours before a vote on such amendment.” The underlying legislation was the FY 2018 Senate budget resolution that set up reconciliation instructions for tax reform. The vote was on the amendment. The Senate rejected the amendment by a vote of 48 to 51.

<h4><strong><u>Cornyn Voted In Favor Of Allowing Taxes To Rise On The Middle Class</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2017: Cornyn Effectively Voted To Allow Taxes To Rise On The Middle Class As A Result Of Trump’s Tax Reform.</strong> In November 2017, Cornyn effectively voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, “eliminate any provisions ‘that would raise taxes on millions of middle-class taxpayers.’” The underlying bill was the Senate GOP’s tax reform bill. The vote was on a motion to commit the bill back to the Senate Finance committee. The Senate rejected the motion by a vote of 48 to 51.

  <li><strong>Legislation Would Increase Taxes On 9 Percent Of Taxpayers In 2019 And More Than 50 Percent Of Americans By 2027. According to Associated Press via the CNBC, “Trump spoke as the Tax Policy Center said that while all income groups would see tax reductions, on average, under the Senate bill in 2019, 9 percent of taxpayers would pay higher taxes that year than under current law. By 2027, that proportion would grow to 50 percent, largely because the legislation's personal tax cuts expire in 2026, which Republicans did to curb budget deficits the bill would create.” [Associated Press via CNBC, </strong><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/20/senate-gop-tax-plan-to-ultimately-raise-taxes-for-half-of-us-tax-policy-center.html"><strong><u>11/21/17</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>

<p><strong>2017: Cornyn Effectively Voted Against Creating A 60 Vote Point Of Order Against Legislation That Increased Taxes On Those Earning Less Than $250,000 Per Year.</strong> In October 2017, Cornyn effectively voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, “create[d] a 60-vote point of order against any reconciliation legislation that would raise taxes on taxpayers whose annual income is below $250,000.” The underlying legislation was the FY 2018 Senate budget resolution that set up reconciliation instructions for tax reform. The vote was on a motion to waive the budget act. The Senate rejected motion, effectively killing the amendment, by a vote of 47 to 51.

According to Congressional Quarterly, “This Conference Summary deals with the conference report on HR 1, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the House will consider Tuesday. The agreement significantly cuts corporate and individual taxes and seeks to simply the tax code, although most individual tax provisions would expire after 2025. It reduces the corporate tax from 35% to 21% and reduces taxation of so-called ‘pass-through’ businesses where profits are taxed at the individual rate. For corporate taxes it also establishes a ‘territorial’ tax system that exempts most overseas income from U.S. taxation. Most individual tax rate rates would be reduced, including by dropping the top rate from 39.6% to 37%, and it eliminates personal exemptions but nearly doubles the standard deduction so fewer taxpayers will itemize deductions.” The vote was on a motion to recede from the Senate version of the bill and agree concur with a further amendment, essentially on passage. The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 51 to 48. The House later agreed to the modified version of the bill. President Trump signed the bill into law.

  <li><strong>Tax Policy Center: From 2018 – 2025, Average Taxes Fall For Most Americans, But By 2027, 53 Percent Of Americans Would Pay More. According to the Tax Policy Center, “The Tax Policy Center has released distributional estimates of the conference agreement for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as filed on December 15, 2017. We find the bill would reduce taxes on average for all income groups in both 2018 and 2025. In general, higher income households receive larger average tax cuts as a percentage of after-tax income, with the largest cuts as a share of income going to taxpayers in the 95th to 99th percentiles of the income distribution. On average, in 2027 taxes would change little for lower- and middle-income groups and decrease for higher-income groups. Compared to current law, 5 percent of taxpayers would pay more tax in 2018, 9 percent in 2025, and 53 percent in 2027.” [Tax Policy Center, </strong><a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/publication/150816/2001641_distributional_analysis_of_the_conference_agreement_for_the_tax_cuts_and_jobs_act.pdf"><strong><u>12/18/17</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>In 2027, 83 Percent Of The Total Tax Benefit Would Go To The Top One Percent. According to Tax Policy Center, “In 2027, the overall average tax cut would be $160, or 0.2 percent of after-tax income (table 3), largely because almost all individual income tax provisions would sunset after 2025. On average, taxes would be little changed for taxpayers in the bottom 95 percent of the income distribution. Taxpayers in the bottom two quintiles of the income distribution would face an average tax increase of 0.1 percent of after-tax income; taxpayers in the middle income quintile would see no material change on average; and taxpayers in the 95th to 99th income percentiles would receive an average tax cut of 0.2 percent of after-tax income. Taxpayers in the top 1 percent of the income distribution would receive an average tax cut of 0.9 percent of after-tax income, accounting for 83 percent of the total benefit for that year.” [Tax Policy Center, </strong><a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/publication/150816/2001641_distributional_analysis_of_the_conference_agreement_for_the_tax_cuts_and_jobs_act.pdf"><strong><u>12/18/17</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>In 2027, 86 Million Americans Would See A Tax Increase. According to ABC News, “The bill, which carries an estimated $1.5 trillion price tag over 10 years, is not expected to win any Democratic support. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi points to a new analysis from the non-partisan Tax Policy Center that predicts 86 million people would see a tax increase compared to current law by 2027, while 83 percent of the anticipated benefits would be reaped by the wealthiest one percent of taxpayers.” [ABC News, </strong><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-expected-pass-tax-reform-measure/story?id=51870650"><strong><u>12/19/17</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Most Of The Bill’s Tax Cuts For Individuals Are Temporary, But The Corporate Ones Are Permanent. According to the Washington Post, “The core of the plan is a massive and permanent cut to the corporate tax rate, dropping it from 35 percent to 21 percent. The bill also would cut individual tax rates for all income tax levels. Families earning less than $25,000 a year would receive an average tax cut of $60, while those earning more than $733,000 would see an average cut of $51,000, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Many of the breaks for individuals are set to expire in the coming years. Republicans set those expiration dates to comply with Senate limits on how much their legislation could add to the nation’s deficit, and they say a future Congress will extend the cuts or make them permanent.” [Washington Post, </strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/gop-tax-bill-headed-for-quick-passage-in-house-senate-on-tuesday/2017/12/19/61f83dac-e4cf-11e7-9ec2-518810e7d44d_story.html?utm_term=.34af37ede8f0"><strong><u>12/20/17</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>

  <li><strong>Earlier That Day, The Joint Committee On Taxation Released A Dynamic Score Of The Tax Bill Saying That Even With Economic Growth, The Bill Would Add $1 Trillion To The Deficit Over Ten Years. According to Washington Post, “One of the most controversial aspects of President Trump’s tax plan is how much it costs. Republicans approved adding up to $1.5 trillion to America's debt to pay for tax cuts for businesses and individuals, but they claimed that the price tag wouldn't be nearly that high because the plan would unleash a lot more economic growth. Now Congress’s official estimators have weighed in: The Senate GOP bill would add $1 trillion to the debt even after accounting for economic growth generated by the tax cuts. The estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan group of experts, was released Thursday afternoon as lawmakers hotly debated the tax bill on the Senate floor. The Senate GOP tax plan would cause faster economic growth -- about 0.8 percent more over the next decade, JCT found. But that amount of growth only covers about a third of the cost, far short of what is needed to have revenue-neutral tax reform, as the White House initially claimed.” [Washington Post, </strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/30/senate-gop-tax-plan-would-fall-1-trillion-short-of-trump-administrations-promises-congress-tax-analyst-says/?utm_term=.08670b519708"><strong><u>11/30/17</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>

(When this blog post mentions budget numbers, the periods described are in fiscal years.) When debt-service costs were added, the increase in the total deficit came to $2.314 trillion.

<h4><strong><u>Cornyn Voted In Favor Of Permanent Corporate Tax Reductions</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2017: Cornyn Voted For The Final Version Of Trump’s Tax Reform Plan, Which Substantially Cut Taxes For Rich Americans And Corporations.</strong> In December 2017, Cornyn voted for the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, also known as Trump’s tax reform bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, “This Conference Summary deals with the conference report on HR 1, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the House will consider Tuesday. The agreement significantly cuts corporate and individual taxes and seeks to simply the tax code, although most individual tax provisions would expire after 2025. It reduces the corporate tax from 35% to 21% and reduces taxation of so-called ‘pass-through’ businesses where profits are taxed at the individual rate. For corporate taxes it also establishes a ‘territorial’ tax system that exempts most overseas income from U.S. taxation. Most individual tax rate rates would be reduced, including by dropping the top rate from 39.6% to 37%, and it eliminates personal exemptions but nearly doubles the standard deduction so fewer taxpayers will itemize deductions.” The vote was on a motion to recede from the Senate version of the bill and agree concur with a further amendment, essentially on passage.

  <li><strong>Most Of The Bill’s Tax Cuts For Individuals Were Temporary, But The Corporate Ones Were Permanent. According to the Washington Post, “The core of the plan is a massive and permanent cut to the corporate tax rate, dropping it from 35 percent to 21 percent. The bill also would cut individual tax rates for all income tax levels. Families earning less than $25,000 a year would receive an average tax cut of $60, while those earning more than $733,000 would see an average cut of $51,000, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Many of the breaks for individuals are set to expire in the coming years. Republicans set those expiration dates to comply with Senate limits on how much their legislation could add to the nation’s deficit, and they say a future Congress will extend the cuts or make them permanent.” [Washington Post, </strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/gop-tax-bill-headed-for-quick-passage-in-house-senate-on-tuesday/2017/12/19/61f83dac-e4cf-11e7-9ec2-518810e7d44d_story.html?utm_term=.34af37ede8f0"><strong><u>12/20/17</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
