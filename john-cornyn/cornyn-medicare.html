<h2><strong>Cornyn Backed Medicare Cuts And Privatization</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Cornyn Voted For GOP Budgets That Cut Medicare By Nearly $500 Billion</strong></h3>
<p><strong>2017: Cornyn Voted For The GOP FY 2018 Budget Resolution, Which Started The Process Towards Tax Reform And Called For Cutting Medicare By $473 Billion.</strong> In October 2017, Cornyn voted for a budget resolution that would have, according to The Hill, “The spending blueprint is key to Republicans’ efforts to pass tax reform because it includes instructions that will allow the plan to avoid a Democratic filibuster. […] The budget, meant to outline spending for the fiscal year, was widely viewed as a mere vehicle for passing tax reform. […] The budget would allow the Senate GOP’s tax plan to add up to $1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade, a proposal that has raised concerns with fiscal hawks in the GOP. Its instructions call for the Senate Finance Committee to report a tax bill by Nov. 13. Still, the document outlines the Senate GOP’s political vision. It maintains spending at 2017 levels for the year, but would then cut nondefense spending in subsequent years, leading to a $106 billion cut in 2027. It would also allow defense levels to continue rising at their current rates, reaching $684 billion at the end of a decade. The resolution also proposes $473 billion in cuts to Medicare’s baseline spending over a decade and about $1 trillion from Medicaid, though those provisions are not enforceable without additional legislation.” The vote was on passage. The Senate agreed to the budget by a vote of 51 to 49. The House later passed the budget resolution.

<p><strong>2017: Cornyn Voted For $473 Billion In Medicare Cuts.</strong> In October 2017, Cornyn voted against an amendment that would have eliminated the $473 billion in Medicare cuts found in the underlying budget resolution. According to a floor speech by Sen. Nelson (D-FL), “Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, before Medicare, one-half of senior citizens in this country did not have any healthcare, health insurance. Medicare changed that. So why in the world would we want to cut $473 billion from Medicare? It does not make sense. My amendment simply restores that cut and replaces it with eliminating a number of tax loopholes. It is a simple amendment. Save Medicare.” The underlying legislation was the FY 2018 Senate budget resolution that set up reconciliation instructions for tax reform. The vote was on the amendment. The Senate rejected the amendment by a vote of 47 to 51.

  <li><strong>Passage Of Budget Resolution Would Put In Motion The Repeal Of Significant Portions Of The Affordable Care Act. According to Vox, “The new Congress was sworn in on Tuesday, and the first thing it did was prepare to repeal Obamacare. Senate Budget Committee Chair Michael Enzi (R-WY) introduced a budget resolution Tuesday that includes ‘reconciliation instructions’ that enable Congress to repeal Obamacare with a simple Senate majority. Passing a budget resolution that includes those instructions will mean that the legislation can pass through the budget reconciliation process, in which bills cannot be filibustered. That means Republicans will only need 50 of their 52 members in the Senate, and a bare majority in the House, to pass legislation repealing the Affordable Care Act. According to the Wall Street Journal, the budget resolution could be passed by both houses as early as next week.” [Vox, </strong><a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/3/14154820/senate-obamacare-budget-resolution-reconciliation"><strong><u>1/3/17</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
