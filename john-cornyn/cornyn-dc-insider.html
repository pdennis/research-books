<h2><strong>Cornyn Was A DC Insider And A Creature Of The Swamp</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Cornyn Was Mitch McConnell’s “Lapdog” And Was Closely Aligned With The Former GOP Leader</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Cornyn Was Described As McConnell’s “Lapdog”&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Cornyn Was Described As McConnell’s “Quiet Lapdog Sitting Next To His Master” </strong>According to the Houston Chronicle, “In Texas, some of that criticism splattered on Cornyn. ‘He's a quiet lapdog sitting next to his master, Mitch McConnell,’ said Brett Rogers, the campaign manager for one of Cornyn's top Republican rivals in the 2014 primary, Dwayne Stovall.” [Houston Chronicle, <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/In-an-age-of-bombast-Cornyn-strives-for-quiet-11946101.php"><u>8/20/17</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Austin American-Statesman: Cornyn Was Described As McConnell’s “Aide-De-Camp” And Had “Shown Him Deference.” </strong>According to the Austin American-Statesman, “Cornyn has effectively been the aide-de-camp to senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, R-KY., and has shown him deference while making clear that he is in waiting to be leader some day himself. In the meantime, Cornyn will continue to be a part of McConnell’s leadership team as a counselor. Cornyn has two years remaining in his third term and already has lined up key endorsements in his re-election bid.” [Austin American-Statesman, <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/19/cornyn-leaves-senate-gop-whip-post-recalls-roller-coaster/6595420007/"><u>12/19/18</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Dallas Morning News: Cornyn “Almost Never” Broke Ranks With McConnell. </strong>According to the Dallas Morning News, “But Cornyn has almost never broken ranks in public with McConnell, who has led Senate Republicans since 2007.” [Dallas Morning News, <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2017/08/11/cornyn-stands-by-mcconnell-amid-trump-s-withering-attacks/"><u>8/11/17</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Cornyn Attempted To Publicly Ingratiate Himself To McConnell&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2020: Texas Observer: For McConnell’s Birthday, Cornyn Gave Him “A Framed Photo Of McConnell, Front And Center, Holding Court At A Press Conference, With Cornyn […] Standing Behind Him.” </strong>According to the Texas Observer, “As a fellow traveler of the establishment, Cornyn quickly made it known that he came in peace. A few weeks into their new relationship, he gave a birthday gift to his boss: a framed photo of McConnell, front and center, holding court at a press conference, with Cornyn and another top lieutenant standing behind him.” [Texas Observer, <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/john-cornyn-profile-mitch-mcconnell-trump-2020/"><u>9/30/20</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>There Were “Thousands” Of Photos Of McConnell With Cornyn Standing Behind Him. </strong>According to the Texas Observer, “There are thousands of photographs to this effect. Sometimes Cornyn stands behind him off his left shoulder, other times to his right or directly behind, causing his face to be hidden by McConnell’s mug on TV. A shame, really, given Cornyn, who is now 67, has those made-for-CSPAN looks: a tall frame and long, sober face topped with a distinguished head of white hair, senatorial in every sense of the word. He is a stark contrast to McConnell, with his testudinal features and utterly dull affect.” [Texas Observer, <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/john-cornyn-profile-mitch-mcconnell-trump-2020/"><u>9/30/20</u></a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Cornyn Wrote On Photos That He Would Have McConnell’s Back, A Sign That Cornyn Was “Not Only Humble And Loyal, But Also Knew His Place”. </strong>According to the Texas Observer, “McConnell appreciated the sentiment of this particular snapshot. His new deputy was ‘a little out of focus and halfway in the shadow,’ he fondly recalled. The message accompanying the photo read, ‘Happy birthday Mitch, I've got your back.’ McConnell took it as a sign that Cornyn was not only humble and loyal, but also knew his place.” [Texas Observer, <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/john-cornyn-profile-mitch-mcconnell-trump-2020/"><u>9/30/20</u></a>]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2019: Cornyn Defended McConnell’s Deliberate Legislative Inactivity In The Senate—A Move That Worried Some Republicans—Saying It Was “A Smart Move On His Part.” </strong>According to New York Times, “Now some Republicans, privately frustrated with the lack of legislative progress, worry that they may receive the same treatment at the hands of Democrats next year if they don’t start to produce. (Senate leaders often say that members demand votes right up to the moment they are asked to take a dicey one.) Others believe Mr. McConnell is making the best of a difficult political environment. ‘I think he wants to unify Republicans, and I believe the president’s support will help us do that,’ said Senator John Cornyn, a top ally of Mr. McConnell as the Senate’s former No. 2 Republican. ‘I think it is a smart move on his part.’” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/us/politics/senate-legislation.html"><u>9/14/19</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>2017: Cornyn Stood By McConnell When Trump Urged McConnell To Step Down As Senate Majority Leader. </strong>According to the Dallas Morning News, “With President Trump hinting that he’d like to see Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell step down, Texas Sen. John Cornyn — the deputy GOP leader and McConnell’s most likely successor — came to his defense on Friday. Cornyn didn’t criticize the president for his attacks, but in his typically genteel way, he made it clear that in the escalating feud, he’s on the side of his fellow senator. And he cast it as a ‘call for unity’ rather than a sign of a schism in the party. ‘Passing POTUS’s legislation agenda requires a team effort,’ Cornyn tweeted, using the medium Trump has been using for days to castigate McConnell. ‘No one is more qualified than Mitch McConnell to lead Senate in that effort.’” [Dallas Morning News, <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2017/08/11/cornyn-stands-by-mcconnell-amid-trump-s-withering-attacks/"><u>8/11/17</u></a>]</p>
<h3><strong>Cornyn Called For A Freeze On Congressional Pay During A Government Shutdown But Still Accepted His Salary</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Federal Government Shut Down Over Trump’s Demands For Border Wall Funding. </strong>According to Vox, “The federal government has been partially shut down since December 22 — with no end in sight. Politically, the stalemate might seem justifiable: President Donald Trump is determined to get funding for the border wall that was his signature promise of the 2016 presidential election, and Democrats in Congress — who as of January 3 will control the House of Representatives — are determined not to give it to him.” [Vox, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/21/18151974/trump-border-wall-steel-slats-shutdown"><u>1/2/19</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Cornyn Sponsored Legislation To Halt The Pay Of Congress During A Government Shutdown And Said Congress Should Not Take Their Paychecks…</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Cornyn Co-Sponsored Legislation To Halt The Pay Of Congress During A Government Shutdown. </strong>According to Newsweek, “Republican Senators John Cornyn of Texas and Steve Daines of Montana co-sponsored an act Wednesday that would halt the pay of Congress during a government shutdown. Another senator proposed not only stopping the pay of Congress, but not allowing any backpay accrued during a shutdown. […] Cornyn tweeted a message Wednesday night saying they should forego their own paychecks until the current shutdown — entering its 20th day on Thursday — is resolved. ‘Pleased to join my friend Senator Steve Daines of Montana and cosponsor his ‘No Government No Pay Act of 2019.’ Congress shouldn’t get paychecks during a shutdown while honorable federal government employees are denied theirs for no good reason.’” [Newsweek, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/government-shutdown-senators-sponsor-bills-stop-congress-pay-during-shutdown-1285999"><u>1/9/19</u></a>]</p>

<h5><i>Federal Employees Went Without Pay During The Government Shutdown</i></h5>
<p><strong>800,000 Federal Employees Were Forced To Go Unpaid Due To The Government Shutdown. </strong>According to USA Today, “It was supposed to be payday. But paychecks are on hold for some 800,000 federal employees forced to go on unpaid leave or work without pay since Dec. 22 because of the government shutdown.” [USA Today, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/11/government-shutdown-paychecks-hold-thousands-federal-workers/2538807002/"><u>1/11/19</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>At Least 35,000 Texans Went Without Paychecks During The Government Shutdown. </strong>According to the Texas Tribune, “Stuck in the middle are hundreds of thousands of Americans — and at least 35,000 Texans on the federal payroll — who will not receive their paychecks Friday. These are NASA employees in Houston; park rangers in Big Bend; Bureau of Printing and Engraving employees in Fort Worth; officials responsible for keeping Texas' airports, border and ports of entry secure; and other federal employees who work for more than a dozen cabinet departments and agencies.” [Texas Tribune, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/01/11/shutdown-anxiety-sweeps-both-texas-and-washington/"><u>1/11/19</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>When Asked If Federal Contractors Should Receive Back Pay, Cornyn Said “I Don’t Think We Can Pay People Who Didn’t Work, Even Through No Fault Of Their Own. They’re Not Federal Employees, So It’s Not A Federal Government, Federal Taxpayer Responsibility.” </strong>According to Vox, “What do you make of the intention to try to pay contractors who didn’t see this coming and lost out on wages? John Cornyn I don’t think we can pay people who didn’t work, even through no fault of their own. They’re not federal employees, so it’s not a federal government, federal taxpayer responsibility. I just think it’s very unfortunate. Li Zhou Do you think they’re comparable to furloughed federal employees? John Cornyn No. If they’re not working for the federal government, they’re not comparable. Li Zhou Do you think there should be a change to the system like the bill tries to do, to fix that and help, at least in this one-off instance, to compensate people? John Cornyn No, I don’t think so.” [Vox, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/19/18225256/republicans-back-pay-contractors"><u>2/19/19</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>…But Cornyn Still Accepted His Salary During The Government Shutdown</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Cornyn Said He Had Not Deferred His Salary During The Government Shutdown. </strong>According to WBAP, “Calling the continued partial government shutdown embarrassing for members of Congress, Senator John Cornyn says he hopes the White House and Congress can break the impasse. ‘There is a very human cost to all this which unfortunately seems lost in the partisan politics of Washington D.C.,’ Cornyn said. However Cornyn said, when asked, that he has not deferred his salary. Cornyn says he has no doubt the federal workers who missed their paychecks are wondering how much longer the shutdown will last.” [WBAP, <a href="http://www.wbap.com/2019/01/16/cornyn-calls-shutdown-embarrassing-for-members-of-congress/"><u>1/16/19</u></a>]</p>

<h4><strong><u>Cornyn Voted Against Freezing Congressional Salaries</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2019: Cornyn Voted Against The FY 2020 Minibus Appropriations Bill, Which Continued A Freeze On Salaries Of Members Of Congress.</strong> In December 2019, Cornyn voted against the FY 2020 minibus spending bill, which represented 8 of the 12 appropriations bills. According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill “continues the freeze on salaries of members of Congress, thereby preventing any pay increase for 2020; a pay freeze for lawmakers has been in place since 2009. However, it does increase the salary cap on senior staff members to $172,900 to respond to complaints that lower salaries were preventing Congress from attracting staff with the required technical expertise to address complex issues.” The vote was a motion to concur. The Senate agreed to the motion by a vote of 71-23, thereby sending the bill to the president, who signed it into law.

<p><strong>October, 2013: Cornyn Voted Against Shutdown-Ending Compromise Agreement, Which Included Provision Blocking Members Of Congress From Receiving A Pay Increase During Fiscal Year 2014.</strong> In October 2013, Cornyn effectively voted against a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, included a provision that “explicitly prohibit[ed] a pay increase for members of Congress for FY 2014.” The provision was part of the bill that ended the October 2013 federal government shutdown by temporarily funding the government through January 15, 2014 and effectively suspending the federal debt ceiling through February 7, 2014. The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 81 to 18. Afterwards, the House agreed to the legislation, and the president signed it into law.

  <li><strong>Congressional Pay Scheduled To Increase By About $3,400 In January 2004. </strong>According to the amendment’s sponsor, Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI), “My amendment is very straightforward. It would simply eliminate the roughly $3,400 pay raise for Members of Congress that is scheduled to go into effect next January.” [Congressional Record, <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-10-23/pdf/CREC-2003-10-23-pt1-PgS13076-2.pdf#page=13"><u>10/23/03</u></a>]</li>

<h4><strong><u>Cornyn Voted To Allow Congressional Pay Increases</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2012: Cornyn Voted To Allow Pay Increase For Members Of Congress, As Part Of FY 2013 Continuing Resolution.</strong> In September 2012, Cornyn voted against a continuing resolution funding the federal government through late March 2013, and which, according to the Congressional Research Service, “extended the current freeze on General Schedule (GS) pay rates through the duration of this continuing resolution. Since the percentage adjustment in Member pay may not exceed the percentage adjustment in the base pay of GS employees, any delay in the implementation of pay adjustments for GS employees would delay any scheduled Member pay adjustment.” The resolution passed by a vote of 62 to 30. Because the bill had already been approved by the House, it was then sent to the president, who signed it into law.

<h4><strong><u>Cornyn Voted Against Eliminating Congressional Pay Increases</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2009: Cornyn Effectively Voted Against FY 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, Which Included Provisions Eliminating Scheduled January 2010 Congressional Pay Increase Of 1.5 Percent.</strong> In March 2009, Cornyn effectively voted against the Omnibus Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2009, which, among other things, cancelled the scheduled January 2010 pay increase for members of Congress. According to the Congressional Research Service, “Under the formula established in the Ethics Reform Act, Members were originally scheduled to receive a pay adjustment in January 2010 of 2.1%. This adjustment was denied by Congress through a provision included in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act, which was enacted on March 11, 2009. Section 103 of Division J of the act states, ‘Notwithstanding any provision of section 601(a)(2) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (2 U.S.C. 31(2)), the percentage adjustment scheduled to take effect under any such provision in calendar year 2010 shall not take effect.’ Had Congress not passed legislation prohibiting the Member pay adjustment, the 2.1% projected adjustment would have been downwardly revised automatically to 1.5% to match the 2010 GS base pay adjustment.” After the Senate voted, 62 to 35, to end debate on the bill, it passed by a subsequent voice vote. The president signed the bill into law.
