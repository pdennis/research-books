<h4><strong><u>Cornyn Voted For 20-Week Abortion Bans With No Exemptions For Mother’s Health</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2018: Cornyn Effectively Voted For The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, Which Banned Abortion After 20-Weeks.</strong> In January 2018, Cornyn voted for legislation banning abortion after the fetus is 20-weeks old. According to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would prohibit abortions in cases where the probable age of the fetus is 20 weeks or later and would impose criminal penalties on doctors who violate the ban, with certain exceptions. The bill would require a second doctor trained in neonatal resuscitation to be present for abortions where the fetus has the ‘potential’ to survive outside the womb.” The vote was on a motion to invoke cloture on a motion to proceed, which required 60 affirmative votes. The Senate rejected the motion by a vote of 51 to 46. [Senate Vote 25, <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00025"><u>1/29/18</u></a>; Congressional Quarterly, <a href="http://cq.com/vote/2018/S/25?0"><u>1/29/18</u></a>; Congressional Actions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2311/all-actions"><u>S. 2311</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>99 Percent Of Abortions Were Before 21 Weeks And Those After Are Due To Complex Situations. According to Planned Parenthood Action Fund, “Nearly 99 percent of abortions occur before 21 weeks, but when they are needed later in pregnancy, it’s often in very complex circumstances. For example, severe fetal anomalies and serious risks to the woman’s health — the kind of situations where a woman and her doctor need every medical option available.” [Planned Parenthood Action Fund, </strong><a href="https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/20-week-bans"><strong><u>Accessed 4/21/25</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2015: Cornyn Effectively Voted For A Bill That Would Prohibit Abortions After 20-Weeks Gestation Except In Cases Of Rape Or Incest, But Would Erect New Barriers Such As Requiring Rape Victims To Document That They Received Prior Medical Treatment Or Counseling.</strong> In September 2015, Cornyn effectively voted for a bill that would prohibit abortions after 20 weeks of gestation and would impose criminal penalties on doctors that violated the ban. According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill would, “prohibit abortions in cases where the probable age of the fetus is 20 weeks or later, except in cases of rape, incest against a minor or when the life of the pregnant woman is in danger. Specifically, it would provide an exemption for pregnancies that are the result of rape against adult women if the woman obtained counseling or medical treatment for the rape at least 48 hours before the abortion. Pregnancies resulting from rape or incest against a minor would also be exempt from the ban if the rape or incest had been reported before the abortion to law enforcement or another government agency authorized to act on reports of child abuse. The measure would impose criminal penalties on doctors who violate the ban. The measure also would require health care practitioners to give the same level of care to an infant born alive during a failed abortion as they would give to an infant born at the same gestational age through natural birth.” The vote was on cloture and the Senate rejected the bill 54 to 42; 60 Senators voting yes would have been required to invoke cloture. The House had earlier passed the bill.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bill Would Sentence Doctors To Up To Five Years In Jail For Violating The Ban. According to Congressional Quarterly, “The bill imposes criminal penalties on physicians who violate the ban, with violations subject to a maximum five-year jail sentence, fines or both. It prohibits the prosecution of the woman obtaining the abortion, however, either as the perpetrator or as a conspirator to violate the ban.” [Congressional Quarterly, </strong><a href="http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4681207/3?7&amp;search=CPUgz1bX"><strong><u>5/12/15</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Opponents Of The Bill Said The Exceptions For Health Of The Mother Were Inadequate. According to Congressional Quarterly, “They also say the bill lacks adequate health exceptions for the mother, as a doctor would have to wait until a condition was life-threatening before performing an abortion. Serious but non-life-threatening conditions couldn’t be treated under this ban, they say, which could result in permanent health issues such as infertility.” [Congressional Quarterly, </strong><a href="http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4681207/3?7&amp;search=CPUgz1bX"><strong><u>5/12/15</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Bill Created Barriers For Exceptions In The Case Of Rape Or Incest.</strong> According to Congressional Quarterly, “And while the original bill’s rape and incest provisions were onerous, they say the new language erects new barriers, including requiring rape victims to document that they received prior medical treatment or counseling, and that a second doctor be present for the abortion.” [Congressional Quarterly, <a href="http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4681207/3?7&amp;search=CPUgz1bX"><u>5/12/15</u></a>]</li>

<h4><strong><u>Cornyn Voted To Restrict Access To Private Insurance Plans That Provide Abortion Coverage</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2017: Cornyn Effectively Voted To Restrict Access To Private Insurance Plans That Provide Abortion Coverage.</strong> In July 2017, Cornyn effectively voted for legislation that would have, according to Planned Parenthood, “restructured the tax credits in the underlying legislation in order to restrict coverage of abortion. This Strange Amendment was not about segregating federal funds from abortion – it was really about restricting access to safe and legal abortion. This proposal needlessly restricted women’s access to private plans that offer abortion coverage. Health plans participating in the Marketplace may already choose whether or not to offer coverage of abortion – unless state law prohibits or requires abortion coverage.” The underlying legislation was the legislative vehicle for Trumpcare. The vote was on a motion to waive all applicable budgetary discipline for the amendment, which required a three-fifths majority. The Senate rejected the motion, thereby defeating the amendment, by a vote of 50 to 50.

<p><strong>2017: Cornyn Effectively Voted Against Requiring 60 Votes To Consider Legislation That Would Reduce Reproductive Health Care Coverage And Birth Control Coverage From The Affordable Care Act.</strong> In January 2017, Cornyn voted against waiving a point of order against an amendment that said, according to the text of the amendment, “(a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses, or conference report that makes women sick again by eliminating or reducing access to women’s health care, including decreases in access to, or coverage of, reproductive health care services including contraceptive counseling, birth control, and maternity care, and primary and preventive health care as afforded to them under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148). (b) Legislation That Makes Women Sick Again.--For the purposes of subsection (a), the term ‘makes women sick again’ with respect to legislation refers to any provision of a bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses, or conference report, that would— […] (C) permitting discrimination against providers who provide reproductive health care benefits or services to women; or […] (3) eliminate, or reduce the scope or scale of, the benefits women would have received pursuant to the requirements under title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) and the amendments made to that title. (c) Waiver and Appeal.--Subsection (a) may be waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three- fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under subsection (a).” The underlying legislation was an FY 2017 budget resolution designed to being the process of repealing the Affordable Care Act, which could be passed by a majority vote. The vote was on a motion to waive the budget act in relation to the amendment. The vote required a three-fifths vote for approval. The Senate rejected the motion by a vote of 49 to 49.
