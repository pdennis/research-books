<h2><strong>Cornyn Repeatedly Failed To Protect Social Security Benefits</strong></h2>
<h4><strong><u>Cornyn Defended Elon Musk And DOGE’s Cuts To The Social Security Agency And Echoed Musk’s Belief That Social Security Was A “Ponzi Scheme”</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Cornyn Downplayed DOGE’s Changes At The SSA As A “Transition Period” And Claimed That Elon Musk’s “Ponzi Scheme” Comment Meant Social Security Was “Unsustainable,” Which Cornyn Agreed With.</strong> According to NBC News, “Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said staffing at the Social Security Administration is still a work in progress for DOGE. ‘They’ve had some layoffs, and then they’ve rehired people. They’re still trying to figure out what the right numbers are. And obviously, the sooner they can get that settled, the better,’ Cornyn said. ‘We’re in a transition period, and there’s going to be a number of changes, plus and minus. And I think — ultimately, I don’t think those kinds of personnel decisions are going to be best made by Congress.’ Asked about Musk’s remark that Social Security is a ‘Ponzi scheme,’ Cornyn said, ‘Well, I think I understand he means that there’s fewer and fewer people working and supporting more and more people, and it’s unsustainable. I happen to agree with that.’” [NBC News, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-loop-doge-social-security-administration-rcna198102"><u>3/26/25</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Musk Eliminated Thousands Of SSA Employees, Terminated SSA’s Phone Service, And Shuttered Field Offices; He Pushed Claims Of “Entitlements Fraud” By “Illegal Aliens.”</strong> According to NBC News, “It’s an argument Musk has been making repeatedly in recent weeks, as DOGE and the Trump administration announce and push for more cuts to the SSA, including eliminating thousands of employees from the already lean agency, ending the ability to make claims by phone and shuttering dozens of field offices that help seniors access their benefits. [...] But even with constituents struggling to interface with the SSA, Musk has portrayed pushback to his changes as politically motivated. ‘This is why the Democrats are so upset about the situation,’ Musk said on Fox Business last week. ‘If we turn off this gigantic money magnet for illegal immigrants, then they will leave and they will lose voters.’ ‘Entitlements fraud for illegal aliens is what is serving as a gigantic magnetic force to pull people in from all around the world and keep them here,’ he told Joe Rogan last month, without providing evidence.” [NBC News, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/musk-uses-immigration-claims-voter-fraud-sell-social-security-cuts-rcna196863"><u>3/19/25</u></a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Musk Called Social Security “The Biggest Ponzi Scheme Of All Time” And Supported Privatization.</strong> According to NBC News, “But Musk, who has called it ‘the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,’ has expressed interest at least once in the idea of privatizing Social Security. In December, he shared a social media thread about the topic by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. Lee had called Social Security a ‘nightmare’ and wrote that people would be better off managing retirement savings at least partly on their own. Musk called Lee’s views ‘interesting.’” [NBC News, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/musk-uses-immigration-claims-voter-fraud-sell-social-security-cuts-rcna196863"><u>3/19/25</u></a>]</li>

<h4><strong><u>Cornyn Voted To Facilitate Raising The Retirement Age</u></strong></h4>

<p><strong>2015: Cornyn Voted For Republican Proposal To “Protect” Current Recipients Of Social Security Benefits And Improve Its Finances; Proposal Did Not Include Pledge To “Protect” Future Beneficiaries.</strong> In March 2015, Cornyn voted for an amendment to the Senate’s FY 2016 budget resolution that, according to The Hill, “would protect current Social Security beneficiaries, as well as try to improve the solvency of the program.” The Senate agreed to the amendment by a vote of 75 to 24 and subsequently passed the underlying budget. A compromise budget later was agreed to by both sides of Congress.

  <li><strong>Opponents Claimed That The Amendment Left Future Beneficiaries At Risk, Including Those Who Are Only A Year Or Two Away From Retiring. </strong>According to The Hill, “Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) slammed the amendment, saying, while it protects current Social Security recipients ‘if you're 63 years of age, 64 years of age, 65 years of age, watch out. They’re going after you.’” [Hill, <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/236854-senators-block-social-security-amendment"><u>3/24/15</u></a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Sen. Bernie Sanders Had Introduced An Amendment Protecting All Americans Against Cuts In Earned Benefits. </strong>According to Huff Post, “Just before recessing until April 13, the Senate passed a budget resolution. Prior to final passage, it voted on three separate Social Security amendments. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) offered an amendment protecting all Americans against cuts in their Social Security earned benefits. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) offered an amendment only protecting current beneficiaries from cuts.” [Huff Post, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/expanding-social-security_b_6955394"><u>3/27/15</u></a>]</li>
