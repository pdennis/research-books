# **How To Win Against Scott Perry**

Scott Perry is out of step with Harrisburg–York–Cumberland. He spent his clout trying to overturn an election, pushing a national abortion ban, voting against the infrastructure and veterans’ care his region needs, cheered slashing Medicaid and efforts that squeezed Social Security services, backed tariffs that raised costs for Pennsylvania families, and trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy garbage. That’s not steady leadership for a pragmatic district.

### **PERRY REPEATEDLY VOTED FOR DEVASTATING HEALTH CARE CUTS**

-   Perry [_voted_](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that would kick [_17 million Americans_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including nearly [_12 million Americans_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off of Medicaid. More than [_23,000 Pennsylvanians_](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) in his district could lose their health coverage as a result of his vote.
-   Perry has also [_campaigned_](https://perry.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398500) on the [_full repeal_](https://x.com/American_Bridge/status/1851374516624031889) of the Affordable Care Act and [_voted_](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll256.xml) to repeal it. In 2013, he even [_compared the ACA to slavery_](https://www.politicspa.com/rep-perry-fights-chris-matthews-on-obamacare/51487/) as an example of something that was once legal that was later repealed. [_More than 496,000 Pennsylvanians_](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/total-marketplace-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) were enrolled in ACA Marketplace health insurance plans.

**Message:** Perry voted to rip health coverage from thousands of Pennsylvanians to give tax breaks to billionaires.

### **PERRY SIDED WITH BIG PHARMA OVER PENNSYLVANIANS**

-   Perry has twice cosponsored legislation that would completely repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, which [_lowered prescription drug costs_](https://www.hhs.gov/inflation-reduction-act/index.html) and [_capped the cost of insulin at $35/month_](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-facts-about-the-35-insulin-copay-cap-in-medicare/) for seniors. Perry also [_voted against_](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll420.xml) the Inflation Reduction Act when it came to the House floor in 2022. More than [_450,000 Pennsylvanians_](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ira-rx-prices-pennsylvania.pdf) took prescription drugs that had been selected for price negotiation under the law’s provisions.

**Message:** Perry sided with Big Pharma over cheaper prescription drug costs for Pennsylvanians.

### **PERRY CHEERED AS SOCIAL SECURITY WAS ATTACKED**

-   Perry cheered Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” and even thought it [_wasn’t enough_](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/12/elon-musk-doge-government-shutdowns). Perry believed that [_“every single component of the government”_](https://www.fox43.com/article/news/politics/scott-perry-new-congress/521-a4eb9e12-ff1d-4c07-bde2-b48c5c127412) should be on the table for cuts. Meanwhile, DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [_affecting_](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [_federal government’s_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) ability to [_deliver services_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. More than [_169,000 Pennsylvanians_](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/pa.pdf) in Perry’s district relied on Social Security benefits.
-   Perry has even [_previously_](https://web.archive.org/web/20161019174323/http:/www.patriotsforperry.com/the_issues/social-security/) [_supported_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvSGsv43m0g) raising the Social Security retirement age.

**Message:** Perry was fine with seniors waiting in longer lines for benefits they earned because dismantling government plays better on TV than helping Pennsylvanians.

### **PERRY WAS THE DECIDING VOTE TO PROTECT TRUMP’S TARIFFS**

-   Perry [_defended_](https://www.pennlive.com/news/2025/04/us-rep-scott-perry-voices-support-for-trump-tariffs.html) Trump’s tariffs and claimed they would make American industries [_“come back”_](https://www.pennlive.com/news/2025/04/us-rep-scott-perry-voices-support-for-trump-tariffs.html) despite admitting that they would also hurt [_Pennsylvania businesses_](https://www.pennlive.com/news/2025/04/rep-perry-admits-tariffs-might-make-the-sweetest-place-on-earth-a-bit-bitter.html). Then, he voted four times to protect the tariffs, including in April 2025 when he was the [_deciding vote_](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect them, dooming Pennsylvania families who relied on him to a [_trade war_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/06/trump-tariffs-layofffs-voters-pennsylvania/) and [_rising prices_](https://theburgnews.com/around-the-burg/harrisburg-area-businesses-ponder-impact-of-tariffs-which-are-likely-to-raise-costs-spark-tough-decisions). Tariffs are contributing to [_higher food prices_](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi) and Pennsylvania businesses were [_warning_](https://6abc.com/post/trump-tariffs-small-businesses-warn-price-hike-everyday-items-food-electronics-alcohol/17432575/) they may have to [_raise prices_](https://www.fox43.com/article/money/tariffs-pa/521-a2fbcea6-28e6-4f4e-aeb0-69e30526c227).

**Message:** Higher grocery and equipment prices for Pennsylvanians, political theater for Scotty Perry.

### **PERRY WAS AN ANTI-CHOICE EXTREMIST**

-   Perry was a [_perennial cosponsor_](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republican-congressman-scott-perry-abortion_n_662bdf47e4b0bd041d779adc) of the Life at Conception Act ([_2018_](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/681/cosponsors?s=1&r=15), [_2019_](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/616/cosponsors), [_2021_](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1011/cosponsors), [_2023_](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/431/cosponsors)), which sought to establish fetal personhood – a [_national abortion ban_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/25/ivf-republicans-legislation/) with no exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the mother. Legal analysts warned it also threatened IVF.
-   Perry was [_proudly_](https://web.archive.org/web/20240501233803/https:/patriotsforperry.com/issues/) anti-choice and [_celebrated_](https://twitter.com/RepScottPerry/status/1540349143603970048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1540349143603970048%7Ctwgr%5E868fc0f936f2ececfc4029e002df58d6a8f464ef%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.penncapital-star.com%2Fgovernment-politics%2Fheres-how-pa-politicians-reacted-to-the-u-s-supreme-courts-abortion-decision%2F) the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

**Message:** Central Pennsylvania values freedom and privacy, but Perry wanted to put politicians in the doctor’s office.

### **perry was all talk when it came to releasing the epstein files**

- When it came to releasing the Epstein files, Perry was all talk until Trump signaled it was okay for House Republicans to do more than just talk. Perry had initially come out strongly in support of releasing the Epstein files. He said the American people deserved to know what was in them and they should be released [“immediately.”](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/scott-perry-the-chris-stigall-show-8122025/s-Om5t6CsoM4u?si=3daa308ac7d441cda2b000a80fcf6637&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) He [agreed](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/scott-perry-the-benny-show-262025/s-XPiCKiGByiq?si=cae0bef0f6014e118793d7cac29b2534&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) that the federal government should not be protecting Jeffrey Epstein and that it was taking [too long](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/scott-perry-the-benny-show-41125/s-MTtrEVnBoeh?si=0a91b8f2d0e243989d828dad70f5ccd5&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) to release information. Except, in July, Perry cast the [deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml) against [releasing the Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj), protecting the accused pedophiles named within them. 

- He then tried to claim that congress getting involved in the release of the Epstein files would [make things go slower.](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/scott-perry-the-rj-harris-breakfast-show-982025/s-BFGwVuQVBq4?si=bd80d9f3ccbf46a18212be27abed44c5&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) Perry never [signed](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209) the discharge petition that called for their release and never [co-sponsored](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581/cosponsors?pageSort=alphaByParty) Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna’s resolution calling for their release. 

- Finally, in November 2025, after 11 months, Perry finally [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml) to release the Epstein files, but only after [Donald Trump gave House Republicans permission](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115562626931599548) to do so.


**Message:** When it came to releasing the Epstein files, Perry was all talk until Trump told him it was okay to be more than talk. 

### **PERRY SPREAD ANTISEMITIC CONSPIRACY THEORIES**

Perry has repeatedly spread antisemitic conspiracy theories:

-   In 2024, he got caught [_sharing an antisemitic meme_](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/scott-perry-antisemitic-meme-facebook-campaign-20240703.html#loaded) on his campaign Facebook page.
-   He has previously spread the [_antisemitic and anti-immigrant_](https://www.splcenter.org/resources/hatewatch/racist-great-replacement-conspiracy-theory-explained/) [_“Great Replacement Theory,”_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/04/14/tucker-carlsons-toxic-replacement-rhetoric-gets-picked-up-house/) at one point reportedly claiming that [_“replacement theory is real.”_](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/scott-perry-closed-door-comments?cid=ios_app)
-   He also [_referred_](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/scott-perry-closed-door-comments/index.html) to the KKK as the “military wing of the Democratic party” during a closed-door meeting.

**Message:** Pennsylvanians deserve a problem-solver, not someone who spreads hate and fringe conspiracy theories.

### **PERRY PLAYED A “DIRECT ROLE” IN EFFORTS TO OVERTURN THE 2020 ELECTION RESULTS**

-   Perry played a [_“direct role”_](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/07/senate-judiciary-trumps-2020-pa-house-republican-515549) in efforts that sought to overturn the 2020 election results. One former Trump aide claimed he played a key role in the efforts and even [_asked Trump for a presidential pardon_](https://whyy.org/articles/rep-scott-perry-jan-6-cassidy-hutchinson/) following the January 6^th^ attack on the Capitol. Perry was ordered to [_turn his phone over to investigators_](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/20/politics/trump-scott-perry-cell-phone-records/index.html) as a result of his [_involvement_](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/29/scott-perry-texts-unsealed-00129195).

**Message:** While Pennsylvanians needed help recovering from a global pandemic, Perry was busy trying to throw out their votes.  

### **Pennsylvania Hospitals At Risk** 

[_All hospitals in the district are included in this map; Green hospitals are at risk; Black have been shut down_](https://earth.google.com/web/@40.40367056,-76.77683217,253.17736041a,179442.57598432d,30y,0h,0t,0r/data=CgRCAggBMikKJwolCiExRmVzemRjVzVIcjNuMmw3WnNNQnQ0TVBld3hIb0R1SVggAUICCABKBwjfpsYkEAE?authuser=0)
