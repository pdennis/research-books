## GA-Sen
- [:elephant:***Buddy Carter***](/buddy-carter) Buddy Carter is a career MAGA politician who wants to gut Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security and blindly supports Trump’s moves to wreck the economy. Carter is corrupt, an election denier, and an anti-abortion extremist who puts himself and Donald Trump ahead of everyday Georgians.
- [:elephant:***Mike Collins***](/mike-collins) Mike Collins is a nepo baby Internet troll, who wants to cut Medicaid, privatize Medicare, and raise the Social Security retirement age. Mike Collins ran to be a change agent but is a swampy typical politician, pushing for policies to line his own pockets.
- [:elephant:***Derek Dooley***](/derek-dooley) Derek Dooley is a nepo baby who couldn’t win as a football coach for Georgia’s arch-rival Tennessee, or anywhere else he went. Dooley has failed upwards his entire career and has a knack for saying idiotic things.
