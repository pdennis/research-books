## Fitzpatrick Voted To Protect Trump's Tariffs

**2025: Fitzpatrick Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The
Reversal Of Trump's Tariffs.** In March 205, Fitzpatrick voted for H.J.
Res. 25, "the bill that would provide for Congressional disapproval of,
and nullify, a December 2024 IRS rule related to gross proceeds
reporting by brokers involved in digital asset sales. The rule imposed
reporting requirements, beginning in 2027, on non-custodial barkers who
participate in the decentralized digital asset market. It also required
brokers to file information returns and provide payee statements
reporting gross proceeds from certain digital asset sales and
transactions." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 292 to 132. \[House Vote 71,
[3/11/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll071.xml); Congressional
Quarterly, [3/11/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/71?4);

25](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-joint-resolution/25/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Effectively Blocked The House From Voting To Reverse
    Trump's Tariffs On Mexico, Canada, And China For The Next Year.**
    According to the New York Times, "Republican leaders on Tuesday
    slipped language into a procedural measure that would prevent any
    resolution to end the tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China from
    receiving a vote this year. It passed on party lines as part of a
    resolution that cleared the way for a vote later Tuesday on a
    government spending bill needed to prevent a shutdown at the end of
    the week." \[New York Times,
    [3/11/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]

-   **The Bill Nullified A Law That Would Allow The House And Senate To
    End A Disaster Declared By The President.** According to the New
    York Times, "In this case, Republican leaders did so using a
    particularly unusual contortion: They essentially declared the rest
    of the year one long day, nullifying a law that allows the House and
    Senate to jointly put an end to a disaster declared by the
    president." \[New York Times,
    [3/11/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]

-   **Democrats Previously Planned To Force Votes On The Tariffs Under
    The National Emergencies Act.** According to the New York Times,
    "House Democrats had planned to force a vote on resolutions to end
    the tariffs on Mexico and Canada, a move allowed under the National
    Emergencies Act, which provides a mechanism for Congress to
    terminate an emergency like the one Mr. Trump declared when he
    imposed the tariffs on Feb. 1. That would have forced Republicans
    --- many of whom are opposed to tariffs as a matter of principle ---
    to go on the record on the issue at a time when Mr. Trump's
    commitment to tariffs has spooked the financial markets and spiked
    concerns of reigniting inflation." \[New York Times,
    [3/11/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]

-   **The National Emergencies Act Required Consideration Of Resolutions
    Ending A Presidentially Declared Emergency Within Fifteen Calendar
    Days But Republican Leadership Included A Measure In The Bill
    Declaring The Rest Of The Year Did Not Constitute A Calendar Day.**
    According to the New York Times, "The national emergency law lays
    out a fast-track process for Congress to consider a resolution
    ending a presidential emergency, requiring committee consideration
    within 15 calendar days after one is introduced and a floor vote
    within three days after that. But the language House Republicans
    inserted in their measure on Tuesday declared that, 'Each day for
    the remainder of the 119th Congress shall not constitute a calendar
    day' for the purposes of the emergency that Mr. Trump declared on
    Feb. 1." \[New York Times,
    [3/11/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]

## Fitzpatrick Voted To Cut Medicaid, Betraying 68,000 People In His District

**2025: Fitzpatrick Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Framework That Included
\$2 Trillion In Cuts, Raised The Statutory Debt Limit By \$4 Trillion,
And Required House Committees To Recommend Legislation That Would
Implement Trump's Agenda.** In February 2025, Fitzpatrick voted for H.
Con Res. 14 which, according to Congressional Quarterly, "the concurrent
resolution that would recommend a budget for fiscal 2025 and budget
levels through fiscal 2034. The resolution would assume minimum savings
of \$1.5 trillion over 10 years and 2.6 percent economic growth over the
same period. It also would require the statutory debt limit to be raised
by \$4 trillion. It also would authorize the House Ways and Means
Committee to increase deficits by \$4.5 trillion over 10 years to extend
the 2017 tax cuts and implement new tax cuts proposed by the White
House. It also would provide instructions for the budget reconciliation
process through which separate legislation could be considered and
passed in the Senate via a simple majority vote. The measure would
deliver instructions to 11 House committees to report legislation that
would implement President Donald Trump's agenda, such as expanding tax
cuts and bolstering border security and immigration enforcement. The
committees would be required to report their legislative recommendations
to the House Budget Committee by March 27, 2025. It also would set a \$2
trillion target for the spending cuts to be submitted to the House
Budget Committee. The resolution also would stipulate that if the
committees don\'t reach that target, the Ways and Means' reconciliation
instructions to increase the deficit by a maximum of \$4.5 trillion
would be decreased by the amount the other committees come in below the
target. Similarly, it would stipulate that Ways and Means could increase
the deficit above the \$4.5 trillion level by the amount of savings the
committees achieve above the \$2 trillion target." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 217 to 215.
\[House Vote 50, [2/25/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll050.xml);

14](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/14/all-actions)\]

-   **The Budget Framework Requires Cuts To Medicaid If Medicare Is
    Protected.** According to the Democratic Caucus of The House
    Committee on the Budget, "Republicans\' budget (H.Con.Res.14)
    instructs the Energy and Commerce Committee to cut \$880 billion,
    which requires deep cuts to Medicaid. The Energy and Commerce
    Committee oversees Medicare, Medicaid, the Children\'s Health
    Insurance Program (CHIP), and other health, research, environmental
    protection, energy, and telecommunication programs. Medicare and
    Medicaid make up more than 97% of the total spending overseen by the
    Committee, so if you don\'t touch Medicare, the math doesn\'t work
    without deep cuts to Medicaid. The nonpartisan CBO\'s analysis
    confirms that if you protect Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP within the
    Energy and Commerce Committee\'s jurisdiction, mandatory spending
    totals \$381 billion over ten years. Of this amount, only \$135
    billion is available for cuts after excluding budget neutral
    programs, including the ACA Risk Adjustment Program and the
    Universal Service Fund, which are funded by fees and collections.
    CBO\'s analysis confirms that the only way to achieve the \$880
    billion target without touching Medicare is through deep damaging
    cuts to Medicaid!" \[Democratic Caucus of The House Committee on the
