# **How To Win Against Ryan Zinke**

Zinke talks like a Montana independent, but he votes like a big city swamp creature: backing bills that kick thousands of Montanans off their health coverage, siding with tariffs that raise costs and hurt Montana farmers, and standing by while services seniors rely on are threatened. He already left one DC job in scandal; Montanans can’t afford to be burned twice.

### **ZINKE HAS REPEATEDLY ATTACKED AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE**

-   Zinke [_voted_](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that would kick [_17 million Americans_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including [_nearly 12 million Americans_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off of Medicaid. An estimated [_27,000 Montanans_](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) in his district could lose their health coverage as a result of his vote, and he [_put_](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/medicaid-expansion-montana-rural-hospitals/) [_rural hospitals at risk_](https://nbcmontana.com/news/local/one-big-beautiful-bill-act-could-impact-montanas-rural-hospitals). Logan Health in Cutbank, the Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Polson, and Big Sky Medical Center were identified as [_at-risk medical centers_](https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_on_rural_hospitals.pdf) as a result of Zinke’s vote.
-   Zinke has also [_twice_](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/191/cosponsors) [_cosponsored_](https://montanaindependentnews.com/economy/pharmaceuticals-representative-ryan-zinke-inflation-reduction-act-drug-prices-medicare/) legislation that would completely repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, which lowered prescription drug costs and put a $35/month cap on insulin costs for seniors. Approximately [_24,000 Montanans_](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ira-rx-prices-montana.pdf) took prescription drugs that were selected for price negotiation under the Inflation Reduction Act’s provisions.

**Message:** Big Pharma ally Zinke voted to take health coverage from hard-working Montanans all to give tax breaks to billionaires.  

### zinke voted for massive cuts to medicare

- Zinke [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml) for a bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would trigger [nearly $500 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare absent future congressional action.

**Message:** Zinke voted to make massive cuts to health care services seniors rely on all to give tax breaks to billionaires. 

### **ZINKE ABANDONED MONTANA AND SAID THE TRADE WAR “HAD TO HAPPEN”**

-   Zinke defended Trump’s tariffs and claimed, [“the tariff war, it had to happen”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLFtbOFucJc) despite acknowledging they would [hit Montana harder than many states](https://www.mtpr.org/podcast/capitol-talk/2025-03-14/republicans-back-trump-cuts-and-tariffs-lawmakers-return-to-helena). He voted four times to protect the tariffs, including in April 2025 when he was the [deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect them, dooming Montanans who relied on him to a [trade war](https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2025/aug/01/montana-faces-outsized-economic-risks-from-tariffs-amid-national-economic-slowdown/) and rising prices.
-   Tariffs are contributing to [higher food prices](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi) and [hurting Montana farmers](https://nbcmontana.com/news/local/montana-farmers-see-canadian-trade-dry-up-due-to-tariffs). Zinke even admitted that tariffs cause [“some degree of inflation.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coMN-YPmLsE)

**Message:** Zinke, who admitted tariffs cause inflation, said higher food prices and harm caused to Montana farmers “had to happen.”

### **ZINKE SUPPORTED ATTACKS ON SOCIAL SECURITY MONTANA SENIORS RELY ON**

-   Zinke said he [_liked_](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5152748-trump-administration-national-parks/) what Trump’s DOGE was doing as DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [_affecting_](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [_federal government’s_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) [_ability_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/) to [_deliver services_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. More than [_133,000 Montanans_](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/mt.pdf) in Zinke’s district relied on Social Security benefits. Zinke has stood by while Social Security was threatened before. When he was first elected to congress he [_dismissed_](https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2015/apr/02/zinke-attracts-crowd-at-town-hall-meeting-6/) concerns about Republican proposals to cut Social Security and Medicare.
-   Zinke said he liked DOGE even though it resulted in the mass layoffs of [_Montana workers_](https://montanafreepress.org/2025/04/01/yellowstones-gateway-town-fears-for-its-future-amid-trump-funding-cuts/) that threatened [_rural economies_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/05/01/hamilton-montana-federal-government-job-cuts/).

**Message:** Social Security is a promise, not a bargaining chip. Montanans' livelihoods aren’t pawns in a political game. Montanans can’t be collateral damage in Zinke’s partisan political games. 

### It took zinke 11 months to vote to release the epstein files and he did only after trump gave republicans permission. 

-   In November 2025, after 11 months, Zinke finally [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml) to release the Epstein files, but only after [Donald Trump gave House Republicans permission](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115562626931599548) to do so. Previously, Zinke had [cast the deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml) against [releasing the Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj), protecting the accused pedophiles named within them. He even said he believed there was no secret Epstein list or volume of information that would indict anyone. Zinke never [signed](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209) the discharge petition that called for their release and he never [co-sponsored](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581/cosponsors?pageSort=alphaByParty) Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna’s resolution calling for their release.

**Message:** It took Zinke, who claimed there was no secret Epstein list, 11 months to vote to release the Epstein Files. 

### **ETHICS DISASTER RYAN ZINKE**

Ryan Zinke [_resigned_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/interior-secretary-zinke-resigns-amid-investigations/2018/12/15/481f9104-0077-11e9-ad40-cdfd0e0dd65a_story.html) from his post as Interior Secretary amid multiple ethics scandals.

-   The Interior Department Inspector General [_found_](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/16/1081180054/ryan-zinke-interior-investigation-ig-report) that Zinke misused his position as Interior Secretary to advance a development project in his hometown in Montana and failed to disclose the details of his involvement to ethics officials when questioned.
-   The Interior Department Inspector General [_found_](https://apnews.com/article/connecticut-ryan-zinke-climate-and-environment-government-politics-81216694a5cfda056526f5756d3b077f), as Interior Secretary, Zinke lied to investigators about conversations he had with lobbyists, lawmakers, and other officials regarding a bid by two Indian tribes to operate a casino in Connecticut.
-   The Interior Department Inspector General [_found_](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/18/politics/zinke-travel-wife-watchdog/index.html) Zinke violated government rules by allowing his wife to travel with him in government vehicles and for considering making her a volunteer so she could travel for free.
-   Zinke came under scrutiny for planning to [_spend $139,000 to replace doors_](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/08/ryan-zinke-office-doors-interior-448425) in his Interior Secretary office suite. After being confronted about the cost, Zinke claimed he had [_reduced it by half_](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/15/politics/zinke-interior-door).

 **Message:** Zinke didn't think the rules applied to him. Montanans deserve an honest straight-shooter, not another DC swamp creature wasting their money. 

**Hospitals At Risk In MT-01**

[_All hospitals in the district are included in this map; Green hospitals are at risk; Black have been shut down_](https://earth.google.com/web/@46.73761132,-112.81223898,1960.3037678a,604637.38123244d,30.00015646y,0h,0t,0r/data=CgRCAggBMikKJwolCiExRmVzemRjVzVIcjNuMmw3WnNNQnQ0TVBld3hIb0R1SVggAUICCABKBwjfpsYkEAE?authuser=0)
