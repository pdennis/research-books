# How To Win Against Karrin Taylor Robson

Karrin Taylor Robson, who only got [half an endorsement](https://apnews.com/article/trump-endorsement-arizona-governor-596a7c7bc1129119b1c8e401bae987ad) from Donald Trump, supported federal legislation that stripped health care from thousands of Arizonans, set up future cuts to Medicare, cut SNAP benefits, and rescinded tax credits meant to support clean energy jobs and projects in Arizona. Taylor Robson praised Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” calling it a “huge win” and a “historic tax cut.” Taylor Robson also praised Trump’s tariffs, saying they were proof of Trump standing up for American jobs despite the stock market crashing and increasing food prices they caused. She praised Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” and said she would create an Arizona DOGE, but failed to address the Social Security benefits it disrupted for more than 1.53 million Social Security recipients in Arizona, and the 34,000 Arizona federal workers facing DOGE layoffs. Taylor Robson opposed protections for reproductive rights, supported extreme abortion bans, and spread misinformation about pregnancies resulting from rape. Taylor Robson stood by Trump amidst calls for the release of the Epstein files and only called for their release after Trump indicated his support for doing so. Taylor Robson’s desperation for Trump’s approval stretched back to her 2022 gubernatorial campaign, where she used a payroll service to hide her campaign staff’s identities who were previously critical of Trump.

### Taylor Robson Supported Devastating Health Care Cuts

-   In 2025, Taylor Robson supported Trump’s [“One Big Beautiful Bill,”](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) which is estimated to kick [17 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including [nearly 12 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) who rely on Medicaid. Under the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” more than [342,000 Arizonans](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) could lose their health insurance, and rural hospitals in Arizona [were in jeopardy](https://coppercourier.com/2025/07/08/arizona-rural-hospitals-2025/) with [at least five at risk of closing](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2025/07/01/medicaid-cuts-donald-trump-big-beautiful-bill-could-cripple-rural-hospitals/).   
-   Taylor Robson called the “One Big Beautiful Bill” a [“huge win”](https://x.com/KTaylorRobson/status/1940846190381457542?s=20) that would [“protect Medicaid,”](https://x.com/KTaylorRobson/status/1924859622718144936?s=20) even though [193,981 Medicaid recipients](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) in Arizona were expected to lose their coverage by 2034 under the bill. 

**Message:** Taylor Robson supported stripping away health care from thousands of Arizonans to fund tax cuts for the wealthy. 

### Taylor Robson Supported Massive Cuts To Medicare

-   In 2025, Taylor Robson supported the [Republicans’ reconciliation bill](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would trigger [$500 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare. 
-   Taylor Robson called the passing of the bill a [“huge win for Arizona and America,”](https://x.com/KTaylorRobson/status/1940846190381457542?s=20) and a [“historic tax cut for the middle class.”](https://x.com/KTaylorRobson/status/1940145944097411353?s=20)

Tariffs are contributing to [higher food prices](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi) and are [hurting Arizona small businesses](https://www.abc15.com/news/local-news/how-tariffs-could-help-and-hurt-arizona-businesses) and [families](https://www.kjzz.org/politics/2025-03-01/5-ways-the-trump-tariffs-on-mexico-and-canada-would-hit-arizona-wallets).
-   Despite this, Taylor Robson said the tariffs were evidence of Trump standing up for [“Americans who have seen their jobs shipped overseas,”](https://x.com/KTaylorRobson/status/1909331294879990155?s=20) even as the [U.S. stock market crashed](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/04/nx-s1-5352362/markets-selloff-dow-trump-tariffs) due to Trump’s escalating global trade war.

Taylor Robson [called](https://x.com/KTaylorRobson/status/1940846190381457542?s=20) the bill a “huge win for Arizona and America” while nearly [300,000 Arizona households](https://www.fns.usda.gov/data-research/data-visualization/snap-community-characteristics-congressional-district-dashboard) relied on SNAP to afford groceries.

More than [1.53 million Arizonans](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/az.pdf) relied on Social Security benefits. 
-   Taylor Robson [promoted DOGE](https://youtu.be/4HmKet7kCV4) even though it resulted in [federal funding cuts](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/04/30/14-arizona-programs-lose-6-million-after-federal-funding-cut/) to Arizona nonprofits and organizations, and federal layoffs threatened the livelihoods of [34,000 federal workers](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/03/09/doge-downsizing-arizona-impact/81974555007/) in Arizona.

Since the beginning of the Trump administration, clean energy projects that were projected to create hundreds of jobs in Arizona were [cancelled or stalled](https://azmirror.com/2025/07/09/trumps-tax-bill-eliminates-clean-energy-incentives-costing-arizona-billions/).
