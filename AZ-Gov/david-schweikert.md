# How To Win Against David Schweikert

David Schweikert is unfit to represent Arizona. He voted to kick more than 342,000 Arizonans off their health coverage, for massive cuts to Medicare, and to make food more expensive with his support of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Even before that, he proposed imposing per capita caps on Medicaid, which could result in benefit cuts. Then he dismissed Arizonans’ concerns as “whining” and “bedwetting.” Schweikert cast the deciding vote to protect Trump’s tariffs and has dismissed the harm they were causing to Arizonans. Schweikert was “genuinely impressed” with DOGE cuts that gutted Social Security and fired Arizona workers. He’s an anti-choice extremist who has made disparaging comments about women. Schweikert, who in the past has said he doesn’t think the government should have secrets outside of national security matters, cast the deciding vote to protect accused pedophiles named in the Epstein files, before later voting to release the files after Trump gave House Republicans permission. He was officially reprimanded by the House Ethics Committee for 11 violations and his campaign paid a six-figure federal fine.

### Schweikert To Arizonans: Stop “Whining” About My Support For Health Cuts 

-   In 2025, Schweikert [voted for a bill](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) that was estimated to kick [17 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including [nearly 12 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) who relied on Medicaid. More than [342,000 Arizonans](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) could lose their health insurance as a result of Schweikert’s vote. Schweikert’s vote also [jeopardized the future](https://coppercourier.com/2025/07/08/arizona-rural-hospitals-2025/) of rural hospitals in Arizona, with [at least five at risk of closing](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2025/07/01/medicaid-cuts-donald-trump-big-beautiful-bill-could-cripple-rural-hospitals/).
-   Before voting for the final bill, [Schweikert's own plan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/06/house-republicans-budget-challenges/) proposed $900 billion in cuts to Medicaid through per-capita caps, which could [shift costs to Arizona](https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/medicaid-per-capita-cap-would-harm-millions-of-people-by-forcing-deep-cuts-and#:~:text=Medicaid%20Per%20Capita%20Cap%20Would,on%20Budget%20and%20Policy%20Priorities) and force cuts that could cause people to lose their health benefits. On air, he [dismissed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itUNO5pGhyg) constituents worried about Medicaid and health-care cuts as [“whining” and “bedwetting.”](https://coppercourier.com/2025/08/21/gop-congressman-mocks-medicaid-cuts/) By 2034, [193,981 Medicaid recipients](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) in Arizona were expected to lose their coverage due to Schweikert’s support for Trump’s tax bill.

**Message:** Schweikert is an extremist who wants you and your family to pay more for health care and backs that up with votes – when he isn’t sleeping through them.   

### Schweikert Voted For Massive Cuts To Medicare

-   Schweikert [missed](https://ktar.com/arizona-news/david-schweikert-fell-asleep-bill/5709325/) the May 2025 vote on Republicans’ reconciliation bill because he fell asleep on the job, but made it clear that he would have voted [yes](https://www.kjzz.org/politics/2025-05-27/schweikert-a-couple-more-months-to-go-before-senate-could-pass-trumps-big-beautiful-bill). In July 2025, he got to [vote yes](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml) on the final bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would trigger [$500 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare.

**Message:** Schweikert voted to make massive cuts to health care services seniors rely on. 

### Schweikert Repeatedly Voted Against Allowing Medicare To Negotiate The Prices Of Prescription Drugs

-   Schweikert [repeatedly](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll420.xml) [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll385.xml) [no](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll682.xml) [on](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022102) lowering prescription drug costs for seniors and lowering the cost of insulin. He voted three separate times against allowing Medicare to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs for seniors. The Inflation Reduction Act, which Schweikert voted against, benefited more than [164,000 Arizonans](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ira-rx-prices-arizona.pdf).

**Message:** Schweikert was willing to make Arizona seniors pay more for lifesaving prescription drugs in order to further his own agenda. 

### Schweikert Was The Deciding Vote To Protect Trump’s Tariffs That Hurt Arizonans  

-   Schweikert voted five times to protect Trump’s tariffs, including in April when he was the deciding vote to protect the tariffs from being repealed by Congress, dooming Arizonans who relied on him to a [trade war](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2025/07/21/trump-tariffs-mexican-tomatoes-hurt-arizona-produce-industry/85218091007/) and [rising prices](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi). Tariffs are contributing to [higher](https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/consumers/2025/03/04/donald-trump-tariffs-costs-food/81173998007/) food prices, are [hurting](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/05/02/phoenix-toy-store-bracing-trumps-china-tariffs-impact-pricing-supply/) Arizona [businesses](https://www.kgun9.com/news/community-inspired-journalism/eastside-news/tucson-toy-and-game-stores-brace-for-uncertainty-amid-tariffs) and [farmers](https://www.abc15.com/news/state/it-could-break-us-valley-farmer-says-chinese-tariffs-have-crushed-the-alfalfa-export-market), and could [increase car insurance rates](https://www.axios.com/local/phoenix/2025/08/07/arizona-car-insurance-rates-tariffs).
-   Despite having previously expressed skepticism about Trump’s tariff rollouts, Schweikert later claimed that the [“economy has been remarkably stable”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3rsDzFBx9k) and dismissed the impact the tariffs were having on Arizonans.

**Message:** Schweikert refused to use his power to stop Trump’s tariffs and Arizonans will pay more for groceries as a result.   

### Schweikert Stripped SNAP Benefits From Arizona Families 

-   In 2025, Schweikert [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that made the [largest cut to SNAP in history](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-senate-republican-leaderships-reconciliation-bill-takes). Schweikert called SNAP cuts [“fiscally responsible”](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/08/28/david-schweikert-backs-medicaid-cuts-calls-concerns-whining/85855788007/) and dismissed concerns over cuts as [“whining”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itUNO5pGhyg) and [“bedwetting.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itUNO5pGhyg) In Arizona, more than [294,000 households](https://www.fns.usda.gov/data-research/data-visualization/snap-community-characteristics-congressional-district-dashboard) relied on SNAP to afford groceries.

**Message:** Schweikert voted to strip SNAP benefits from nearly 300,000 Arizonans who relied on them.

### Schweikert stood by while trump attacked social security and fired hard-working Arizonans

-   Schweikert said he was [“genuinely impressed”](https://www.businessinsider.com/doge-capitol-hill-musk-ramaswamy-visit-republicans-2024-12) with the architects of the “Department of Government Efficiency” and said it was doing some [“great stuff”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuG9_BzYm9M) as DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) [ability](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/) to [deliver services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. Schweikert [voted for](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll555.xml) raising the Social Security retirement age to 69 and, in 2023, warned it was the [“end of your republic”](https://americanjournalnews.com/arizona-dave-schweikert-house-representatives-social-security-medicare-funding-cuts-republican-study-committee/) if Congress did not cut major programs benefiting seniors. More than [1.53 million Arizonans](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/az.pdf) relied on Social Security benefits.
-   Schweikert promoted DOGE even though it resulted in [federal funding cuts](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/04/30/14-arizona-programs-lose-6-million-after-federal-funding-cut/) to Arizona nonprofits and organizations. He [downplayed the federal layoffs](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/david-schweikert-arizonas-morning-news-22725/s-05sJgmSuSw5?si=98a2a0f0060f4a78816a13ac6737fb5e&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) while Trump threatened the livelihoods of [nearly 34,000 federal workers](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/03/09/doge-downsizing-arizona-impact/81974555007/) in Arizona.

**Message:** It’s not that Schweikert can’t be trusted on Social Security, rather it’s that he CAN. He’s told seniors and retirees he’d raise the retirement age, is impressed by service cuts, and stood by while Arizonans lost their jobs. Believe him.  

### Schweikert’s Votes Threatened Clean Energy Jobs In Arizona

-   In 2025, Schweikert [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) to [repeal](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-passes-senate-megabill-trump-ira-tax-credit/752276/) clean energy tax credits and make them harder to access, threatening clean energy jobs in Arizona. Since the beginning of the Trump administration, clean energy projects that were projected to create hundreds of jobs in Arizona were [cancelled or stalled](https://azmirror.com/2025/07/09/trumps-tax-bill-eliminates-clean-energy-incentives-costing-arizona-billions/).
-   Schweikert claimed he did not [“see the data”](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2024/07/15/arizona-republicans-skeptical-climate-change-despite-evidence/) for climate change and called climate activists [“incredibly arrogant.”](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2024/07/15/arizona-republicans-skeptical-climate-change-despite-evidence/) He called the regulatory powers of the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Water Act a [“federal power grab.”](https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2014/05/22/epa-seeks-grab-unprecedented-power/9444043/)

**Message:** Schweikert voted to kill job opportunities for Arizonans to give tax cuts to billionaires. 

### Schweikert’s Abortion Extremism And Contempt For Women  

-   Schweikert was a perennial co-sponsor of the Life at Conception Act ([2011](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/374/cosponsors), [2013](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1091/cosponsors), [2015](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/816/cosponsors), [2017](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/681/cosponsors), [2019](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/616/cosponsors), [2021](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1011/cosponsors)), which sought to establish fetal personhood—a national ban with no exceptions for rape, incest, or life of the patient. Legal analysts warned it threatened IVF as well.
-   Schweikert repeatedly voted to strip Americans of their reproductive rights. Schweikert [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll360.xml) against codifying abortion protections in federal law. He [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll362.xml) against protecting out-of-state abortion services and protecting access to FDA-approved abortion drugs. Schweikert also [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll385.xml) against codifying the right to access contraception in federal law.
-   Asked in 2024 if the nationwide abortion ban he supported could ban IVF, Schweikert answered [“I don’t know.”](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2024/04/11/democrats-hit-donald-trump-and-david-schweikert-on-reproductive-abortion-issues/73282133007/)
-   After Roe v. Wade was overturned, Schweikert said he was [“pleased”](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2024/04/11/democrats-hit-donald-trump-and-david-schweikert-on-reproductive-abortion-issues/73282133007/) and that the anti-abortion “battle” had not stopped, it was only different. Schweikert also voted to restrict access to Mifepristone more than once.
-   Schweikert has a history of making [misogynistic comments](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gop-david-schweikert-abortion-arizona_n_67194bd5e4b0ede6b2bff075) on radio shows, even [suggesting](https://x.com/American_Bridge/status/1849829184815644673) that women who got abortions hated America.

**Message:** Schweikert is focused on his own ideological crusade first; he leaves families to figure out the consequences later.  

### Schweikert Was The Deciding Vote To Protect Accused Pedophiles Named In The Epstein Files Before Trump Permitted Republicans To Vote To Release The Files

-   It took Schweikert 11 months to [vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml) for the release of the Epstein files, only after [Trump](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/16/nx-s1-5610552/trump-house-republicans-epstein-files) told House Republicans he approved of the release in November 2025. In July 2025, Schweikert cast the [deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml) against [releasing the Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj), protecting the accused pedophiles named in them.
-   When asked about the Epstein files in the past, Schweikert has said that he [didn’t think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VggMCrT-oX8) the government should have secrets outside of national security matters. Despite claiming he [always supported transparency](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/11/18/arizona-gop-gubernatorial-candidates-want-epstein-files-released/87320745007/) for the files, Schweikert also dismissed the fight over them as a [“shiny object”](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2025/11/18/epstein-files-release-arizona-grijalva/) and [“a ‘fetish’ for the political class.”](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2025/11/18/epstein-files-release-arizona-grijalva/)

**Message:** Schweikert cast the deciding vote against releasing the Epstein files, protecting the accused pedophiles named in them. But once Trump changed his tune, Schweikert followed suit and claimed he supported transparency all along.

### Schweikert’s History Of Corruption 

-   In 2020, the House of Representatives [formally reprimanded](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/30/ethics-rebukes-schweikert-slew-of-violations-388447) Schweikert and fined him $50,000 after the House Ethics Committee found he [violated 11](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/28/david-schweikert-aide-oliver-schwab-probe-680895) different ethics rules, including misuse of office/campaign funds and pressuring official staff to do political work. In 2022, the Federal Election Commission [fined him $125,000](https://www.businessinsider.com/fec-fines-arizona-david-schweikert-125000-campaign-finance-violations-2022-2) for “knowingly and willingly” violating campaign finance rules.
-   In 2022, Schweikert’s campaign consultant was sued over inappropriate campaign materials that suggested Schweikert's opponent was gay. The consultant was forced to [pay $50,000](https://www.kjzz.org/2024-04-30/content-1878636-schweikert-ally-pays-50k-settle-lawsuit-filed-over-2022-campaign-lies) to settle the lawsuit in 2024.

**Message:** Schweikert placed himself above the rules and failed to properly manage his own offices, and now he’s refusing to help Arizonans struggle with costs.
