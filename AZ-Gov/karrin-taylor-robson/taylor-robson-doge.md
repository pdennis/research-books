## Taylor Robson Praised DOGE And The Trump Administration Despite The Harm It Was Causing To The Social Security Administration

### Taylor Robson Wanted To Start An “Arizona DOGE”

**2025: Taylor** **Robson Said She Would Start An “Arizona DOGE” And Claimed That Recent Fraud Discoveries In The State Were “Just The Tip Of The Iceberg.”** According to Taylor Robson at a Cochise County Meet and Greet, “Number one, we're going to have our own Arizona Doge. President Trump revealed at the federal level how much waste, fraud and abuse there is in the federal government. Well, believe me, it's going on in the state government. I don't know if any of you saw the reports a month or so ago about the Pakistani guy, but we don't know if he ever stepped foot in Arizona, defrauded our access program by over $500 million. I mean, how does that happen? Do we not have any check and balance sheet? $264 million in uninsurance claims or insurance claims that they don't know where they are? Indeed, yes. And so that's just the tip of the iceberg.” \[Karrin Taylor Robson – Cochise County Meet And Greet, [8/15/25](https://youtu.be/4HmKet7kCV4)\] (VIDEO)

This is the largest staffing cut in SSA’s history.\[2\] (See Figure 1.)" \[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, [6/23/25](https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/reassignment-wont-fix-the-largest-ever-social-security-staffing-cut)\]

Amid all this, the agency no longer has a system to monitor customer experience because that office was eliminated as part of the cost-cutting efforts led by Elon Musk. And the phones keep ringing. And ringing." \[Washington Post, [3/25/25](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/25/social-security-phones-doge-cuts/)\]

Now, 13 AmeriCorps employees who work with ‘Be Kind’ are getting let go. Those employees worked at 13 predominantly Title I schools across the Valley, and they’ve helped thousands of kids with youth development and hundreds of teachers, too. \[…\] See below for a full list of Arizona programs that are losing funding:  Northern Arizona University Arizona Teacher Residency Arizona Supreme Court Probation Services Division  Arizona State University BE SAGE Program Northern Arizona University Environmental Steward AmeriCorps West Valley Health Equity Northern Arizona University Public Health Executive Office of State of Arizona Placeholder Funds for future allocation Family Scholar House, Inc Vista College Preparatory, Inc. Pima Prevention Partnership Maricopa Superior Court Law Library Parental Support Services AZ Inc Area Agency on Aging, Region One, Inc The Be Kind People Project” \[AZ Family, [4/30/25](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/04/30/14-arizona-programs-lose-6-million-after-federal-funding-cut/)\]

Trump ordered federal workers to report to the office five days per week and signed executive orders banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs and squashing gender identity during his first days back in office.” \[AZ Central, [2/2/25](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/02/02/trump-federal-employee-buyouts-impact-arizona-workers/78102498007/)\]
