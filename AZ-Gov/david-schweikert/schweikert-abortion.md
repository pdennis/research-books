## Overview

Schweikert was a perennial co-sponsor of the Life at Conception Act ([2011](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/374/cosponsors), [2013](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1091/cosponsors), [2015](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/816/cosponsors), [2017](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/681/cosponsors), [2019](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/616/cosponsors), [2021](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1011/cosponsors)), which sought to establish fetal personhood—a national ban with no exceptions for rape, incest, or life of the patient. Legal analysts warned it threatened IVF as well; asked in 2024 if the nationwide abortion ban he supported could ban IVF, Schweikert answered, [“I don’t know.”](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2024/04/11/democrats-hit-donald-trump-and-david-schweikert-on-reproductive-abortion-issues/73282133007/)

Schweikert repeatedly voted to strip Americans of their reproductive rights. Schweikert [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll360.xml) against codifying abortion protections in federal law. He [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll362.xml) against protecting out-of-state abortion services and protecting access to FDA-approved abortion drugs. Schweikert also [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll385.xml) against codifying the right to access contraception in federal law.

After Roe v. Wade was overturned, Schweikert said he was [“pleased”](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2024/04/11/democrats-hit-donald-trump-and-david-schweikert-on-reproductive-abortion-issues/73282133007/) and that the anti-abortion “battle” had not stopped, it was only different. Schweikert has also voted to restrict access to mifepristone more than once.    

Schweikert has a history of making [misogynistic comments](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gop-david-schweikert-abortion-arizona_n_67194bd5e4b0ede6b2bff075) on radio shows, even [suggesting](https://x.com/American_Bridge/status/1849829184815644673) that women who got abortions hated America.  

## Schweikert Was An Anti-Choice Extremist Who Co-Sponsored A Nationwide Abortion Ban Six Times

### Schweikert Co-Sponsored The Life At Conception Act, A Nationwide Abortion Ban, Six Times

**Schweikert Cosponsored The Life At Conception Act Six Separate Times Between 2012-2021.** According to Cronkite News, “But as Democrats point out, from 2012 to 2021, Schweikert co-sponsored a “Life at Conception Act” six times. That would have made abortion almost entirely illegal not only in Arizona but nationwide.” \[Cronkite News, [6/27/24](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2024/06/27/arizona-democrats-hammer-david-schweikert-over-abortion-rights/)\]

-   **7/28/21: Schweikert Cosponsored The Life At Conception Act.** \[H.R. 1001, “Life at Conception Act,” Introduced 2/11/21, Cosponsored [7/28/21](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1011/cosponsors)\]
-   **9/27/19: Schweikert Cosponsored The Life At Conception Act.** \[H.R. 616, “Life at Conception Act,” Introduced 1/16/19, Cosponsored [9/27/19](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/616/cosponsors)\]

-   **3/12/13: Schweikert Cosponsored The Life At Conception Act.** \[H.R. 1091, “Life at Conception Act,” Introduced 3/12/13, Cosponsored [3/12/13](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1091/cosponsors)\]
-   **2/1/12: Schweikert Cosponsored The Life At Conception Act.** \[H.R. 374, “Life at Conception Act,” Introduced 1/20/11, Cosponsored [2/1/12](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/374/cosponsors)\]

**The Life At Conception Act Was Effectively A Total Abortion Ban.** According to the Washington Post, “Several abortion bans have already been introduced in Congress. A six-week abortion ban has been introduced in the House, by Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), and the Life at Conception Act, which would recognize a fetus as a person with equal protections under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, has been introduced in both chambers. Nineteen Republican senators and well over 100 Republicans in the House have co-sponsored the measure, signaling that many would like to see a total ban on abortion.” \[Washington Post, [5/2/22](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/05/02/abortion-ban-roe-supreme-court-mississippi/)\]

-   **The Life At Conception Act Did Not Provide A Carve-Out For IVF.** According to CNN, “Republicans who expressed support for in vitro fertilization in the wake of the controversial Alabama Supreme Court ruling are coming under scrutiny for also backing legislation that declares human life begins at conception, without an exception for IVF — two positions that appear to be at odds with one another, in the latest example of Republicans struggling to thread the needle on reproductive rights issues.  The Life at Conception Act – which was introduced in January 2023 by GOP Rep. Alex Mooney of West Virginia and has 125 total Republican sponsors in the House, including House Speaker Mike Johnson – defines the term ‘human being’ to include ‘all stages of life, including the moment of fertilization, cloning, or other moment at which an individual member of the human species comes into being.’  The bill does not include a carveout for IVF, though it does state that nothing in the bill should ‘be construed to authorize the prosecution of any woman for the death of her unborn child.’” \[CNN, [2/26/24](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/26/politics/republicans-life-at-conception-act)\]
-   **The Life At Conception Act Did Not Provide Exceptions For Rape, Incest, Or The Life Of The Mother.** According to the Cedar Rapids Gazette, “The tweet was referencing Hinsons’s support of the Life at Conception Act, a bill introduced in the House in February 2021, Mathis’s campaign told the Fact Checker. It has not passed the Democratic-controlled House. Hinson is among 163 Republican co-sponsors of H.R. 1011, a proposal that guarantees a constitutional ‘right to life of each born and preborn human person.’  This legislation is a personhood bill, one of many proposals over the years that aims to block abortions at all stages by legally recognizing all stages of human development as persons. The bill defines human beings protected under this measure as those ‘at all stages of life, including the moment of fertilization, cloning, or other moment at which an individual member of the human species comes into being.’  The bill’s language states this constitutional right is ‘vested in each human being,’ and does not indicate any exceptions in cases of rape, incest or when the pregnant person is at risk.” \[Cedar Rapids Gazette, [7/11/22](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/fact-checker-does-ashley-hinson-support-criminalizing-abortions-with-no-exceptions/)\]

The bill would specify that rights established by the bill may not be restricted by certain requirements or limitations related to abortion services, including prohibitions on abortion prior to fetal viability, or after fetal viability if a provider determines that continuation of a pregnancy would pose a risk to a patient's life or health; requirements that patients disclose reasons for seeking an abortion or make medically unnecessary in-person appointments; requirements that providers provide medically inaccurate information or perform specific medical tests or procedures in connection with the provision of abortion services; limitations on providers' ability to prescribe drugs based on good-faith medical judgment, provide services via telemedicine or provide immediate services when a delay would pose a risk to a patient's health; and requirements for facilities and personnel that would not apply to facilities providing medically comparable procedures. It would also prohibit requirements or limitations that are similar to those established by the bill or that impede access to abortion services and expressly or implicitly single out abortion services, providers or facilities.” The vote was on passage.

-   **The Bill Repealed The FDA’s Rule Allowing The Dispense Of Abortion Drugs Without In-Person Consultation.** According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill “nullif\[ied\] the FDA’s January 2023 rule allowing medical providers to dispense the abortion drug mifepristone without an in-person consultation.” \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/28/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/507?14)\]

**2011: Schweikert Voted To Bar Funds In The 2012 Agricultural Appropriations Bill From Being Used For Mifepristone.** In June 2011, Schweikert voted for an amendment to the 2012 agriculture appropriations bill which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, “bar the use of funds in the bill for the abortion drug mifepristone, also known as RU-486.” The House passed the amendment by a vote of 240 by 176. The bill was amended by the Senate, which removed the provision. \[House Vote 445, [6/16/11](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll445.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/16/11](http://cq.com/doc/floorvote-229798000); Congressional Actions, [H.

STEVE KING: This amendment provides that none of the funds made available in this  $15 million telemedicine line item that's in this appropriations bill shall be used for the purpose of purchasing, prescribing, dispensing, procuring, or otherwise administering mifepristone, commonly known as  RU-486.” \[Congressional Record, H.R. 2112, H.Amdt. 463, [6/16/11](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/112th-congress/house-amendment/463/text)\]

She said to the committee, ‘My abortion was the best decision I ever made. It was an act of self-love.’ My gosh, they just don't even hide it and conceal it anymore.

And I'm going to say something incredibly harsh. The left is becoming like a death cult. There, and this is far beyond their radicalized positions and how extreme they've become on the issue of life. If you go over so many of their other issues, um, it is very uncomfortable how they view human beings and society and what it means just to be a gift from God.” \[David Schweikert Interview – Seth Leibsohn Show, [6/29/22](https://soundcloud.com/kayne-carey/the-seth-leibsohn-show-062922/s-6z5F71br7aJ?si=3c6384819e534cc5a0449901a044148b&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)\] (AUDIO)

And we actually you can see it in our numbers in Arizona, even for myself, precincts I had, voting precincts that had much higher, um, blue plastic, blue collar working folks, higher Hispanic populations. Republicans, myself did much better than we've ever done before, but, the not the super high end, but the college educated. HOST: White suburban women right? Trump lost them. SCHWEIKERT: Yeah, with lots of apartments. So, you know, the high end apartments which actually sometimes dominate to female, you could actually see they went much more left, you know, because they were unhappy with having their feelings assaulted by the previous president. And so does that realignment continue? And I think it does. And the classic way to look at that is who's financing who.” \[David Schweikert Interview – Wake Up Tucson, [5/13/21](https://soundcloud.com/kayne-carey/david-schweikert-wake-up-tuscon-051321/s-bwVrSXCigeD?si=9d775698cadc454aab2620c94e7c3cd3&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)\] (AUDIO)

And you think of every failed leftist idea for the last couple of decades, and it's as if the Democrats have been trying to ram it in to these first couple hundred days of Congress. And. You know, at first you go, oh that's just them paying off the left or giving lip service. But the Democrats are really serious about this stuff becoming law. HOST: Yeah. SCHWEIKERT: And that's where the attack on the filibuster. HOST: Yup. SCHWEIKERT: So for I think a number of Democrats in the House, they thought they could vote for the crazy stuff, pacify their Code Pink's their MoveOn.org, their resist groups. You know, the folks who've been radicalized and I hate to say many of these are, you know, suburban females that so disliked the last president. They moved hard, left, not actually understanding, you know, what they're doing to their own family’s future.” \[David Schweikert Interview – Seth Leibsohn Show, [3/17/21](https://soundcloud.com/kayne-carey/david-schweikert-seth-leibsohn-show-3172021/s-TMgOTIm4I4F?si=3c6384819e534cc5a0449901a044148b&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)\] (AUDIO)

### Schweikert Suggested Issues Facing Working Women Were Not Issues Worthy Of The Attention Of The Ways And Means Committee

**June 2022: Schweikert Suggested Issues Facing Working Women Were Not Issues Worthy Of The Attention Of The Ways And Means Committee.** According to an interview of David Schweikert on Wake Up Tucson, “HOST: So tell me about this. This is on your Twitter page. It's from the Ways and Means Committee. It's the bar graph about women's real wage laws. Talk about that please. SCHWEIKERT: Well, to give you an idea how the Democrats now run Congress by virtue signaling. So they called together the entire Ways and Means Committee. And we're not about to do a major, you know, piece of legislation or bring in the experts to talk about what we can do to take on inflation. You know, what we can do to save the poor and the working poor and the working middle class and the country. We're going to hold a hearing on stresses on, you know, female workers. Okay. It's fine. I'm not sure that’s a Ways and Means issue.” \[David Schweikert Interview – Wake Up Tucson, [6/10/22](https://soundcloud.com/kayne-carey/david-schweikert-wake-up-tucson-61022/s-yB6syI3RBlY?si=9d775698cadc454aab2620c94e7c3cd3&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)\] (AUDIO)

-   **Schweikert Suggested Democrats Held A Hearing On Issues Facing Working Women Not Because They Wanted To Address The Issues, But Because They Wanted To Exploit Women For Campaign Purposes.** According to an interview of David Schweikert on Wake Up Tucson, SCHWEIKERT: We're going to hold a hearing on stresses on, you know, female workers. Okay. It's fine. I'm not sure that’s a Ways and Means issue. And they, we brought in a number of witnesses. Remember, Republicans only get one witnesses. The Democrats get in like six. And they brought a number of witnesses that had compelling family stories, great difficulties. Everyone cried. It was it was all a setup for video. It was a setup for Democrat members to have video for their campaigns. Nothing about issues. So I'm sitting there going, but has anyone noticed in the last. And Democrats have been in charge 15 months. I only have data up to about the last 12 months of them being in charge. And working women. You know, there's the value of their wages have fallen almost 5%. They've lost 1/20 of their wages just because of inflation. And none of the Democrats wanted to talk about how much they've actually hurt working women. They wanted to find ways to exploit them for their campaigns.” \[David Schweikert Interview – Wake Up Tucson, [6/10/22](https://soundcloud.com/kayne-carey/david-schweikert-wake-up-tucson-61022/s-yB6syI3RBlY?si=9d775698cadc454aab2620c94e7c3cd3&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)\] (AUDIO)
