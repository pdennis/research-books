# How To Win Against Andy Biggs

Andy Biggs, who only got [half an endorsement](https://apnews.com/article/trump-endorsement-arizona-governor-596a7c7bc1129119b1c8e401bae987ad) from Donald Trump, ran on a [“Arizona First”](https://x.com/andybiggs4az/status/1937697788684566741) agenda, but voted to cut services and raise costs on Arizonans. He voted to kick more than 342,000 Arizonans off their health insurance, for massive cuts to Medicare, and to make it harder for his neighbors to buy food. Biggs cast the deciding vote to protect Trump’s tariffs, which were hurting small businesses and could result in higher food costs for Arizonans. Biggs stood by while Trump laid off Arizonans and gutted the Social Security agency. He voted to cut clean energy tax credits that supported Arizona jobs and projects. Biggs posed a threat to Arizona women's reproductive freedoms as he repeatedly voted against abortion protections. Biggs sided with corporate profits over Arizona workers as he worked to remove workplace safety protections for workers. Despite previously voting against releasing the Epstein files, it took 11 months for Biggs to ultimately vote for the release of the Epstein files only because Trump approved of the release. 

### **BIGGS VOTED FOR DEVASTATING HEALTH CARE CUTS** 

-   Biggs [voted for a bill](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) that is estimated to kick [17 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including [nearly 12 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) who rely on Medicaid. [An estimated 342,000 Arizonans](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) could lose their health insurance as a result of Biggs’ vote.
-   Biggs [called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act,](https://x.com/RepAndyBiggsAZ/status/1975617602182652065)  and pushed for [“reforms," including the elimination of subsidies.](https://www.newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/andy-biggs-obamacare-aca/2025/11/21/id/1235507/) More than [423,000 Arizonans](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/marketplace-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) were enrolled in Affordable Care Act Marketplace health insurance plans. Biggs called Medicaid expansion [“our biggest growing financial danger,"](https://youtu.be/oP4_1zrqN-s)even though Medicaid expansion enabled  coverage for more Arizonans. By 2034, [193,981 Medicaid recipients](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) in Arizona were expected to lose their coverage due to Biggs’ support for Trump’s tax bill. 

**Message:** Biggs voted to rip away health care from thousands of Arizonans to fund tax cuts for the wealthy.  

### **BIGGS VOTED FOR MASSIVE CUTS TO MEDICARE**

- Biggs [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml) for a bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would trigger [$500 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare.

**Message:** Biggs voted to make massive cuts to health care services seniors rely on. 

### Biggs WAS THE DECIDING VOTE TO PROTECT TRUMP’S TARIFFS

-   In 2025, Biggs voted five times to protect Trump’s tariffs, including in April when he was the [deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect the tariffs from being repealed by Congress, dooming Arizonans who relied on him to a trade war and [rising prices](https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/consumers/2025/03/04/donald-trump-tariffs-costs-food/81173998007/) Tariffs are contributing to [higher food prices](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi) and are hurting Arizona [small businesses](https://www.abc15.com/news/local-news/how-tariffs-could-help-and-hurt-arizona-businesses) and [families](https://www.kjzz.org/politics/2025-03-01/5-ways-the-trump-tariffs-on-mexico-and-canada-would-hit-arizona-wallets).
-   Despite this, Biggs called Trump’s tariffs [“brilliant,”](https://x.com/RepAndyBiggsAZ/status/1907570145138032839) even as the [U.S. stock market crashed](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/04/nx-s1-5352362/markets-selloff-dow-trump-tariffs) due to Trump’s escalating global trade war.

**Message:** Biggs was the deciding vote to crush Arizona small businesses and ensure Arizonans will pay more for groceries. 

### BIGGS STRIPPED SNAP BENEFITS FROM ARIZONA FAMILIES

- In 2025, Biggs [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that made the [largest cut to SNAP in history](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-senate-republican-leaderships-reconciliation-bill-takes). Biggs [touted](https://biggs.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-biggs-issues-statement-houses-passage-president-trumps-big#:~:text=Congressman%20Andy%20Biggs-,Congressman%20Biggs%20Issues%20Statement%20on%20House's%20Passage%20of%20President%20Trump's,to%20Medicaid%20and%20SNAP%20benefits) voting for the SNAP cuts and previously called SNAP a [“highly abused welfare program.”](https://x.com/RepAndyBiggsAZ/status/1787868804921360602) In Arizona, more than [294,000 households]( https://www.fns.usda.gov/data-research/data-visualization/snap-community-characteristics-congressional-district-dashboard) relied on SNAP to afford groceries.

**Message:** Biggs voted to make food more expensive for Arizonans. 

### **BIGGS STOOD BY WHILE TRUMP ATTACKED SOCIAL SECURITY AND FIRED HARD-WORKING ARIZONANS**

-   Biggs [praised](https://x.com/andybiggs4az/status/1897117280439562426) Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” as DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) [ability](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/) to [deliver services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. More than [1.53 million Arizonans](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/az.pdf) relied on Social Security benefits.
-   Biggs [promoted DOGE](https://biggs.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-biggs-reintroduces-legislation-support-president-trumps-doge) even though it resulted in [federal funding cuts](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/04/30/14-arizona-programs-lose-6-million-after-federal-funding-cut/) to Arizona nonprofits and organizations. He [downplayed](https://youtu.be/Wa_oxbnc2Ac) the federal layoffs while Trump threatened the livelihoods of nearly [34,000 federal workers](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/03/09/doge-downsizing-arizona-impact/81974555007/) in Arizona.

**Message:** While Social Security lines grew and Arizona workers were laid off, Biggs didn’t help them. 

### **BIGGS' VOTES THREATENED CLEAN ENERGY JOBS IN ARIZONA**

-   In 2025, Biggs [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) to [repeal](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-passes-senate-megabill-trump-ira-tax-credit/752276/) clean energy tax credits and make them harder to access, threatening clean energy jobs in Arizona. Biggs [called](https://redstate.com/redstate-guest-editorial/2025/05/21/biggs-backwards-on-the-beltway-n2189384) for the full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act, claiming Trump’s tax bill did not go far enough in eliminating it. Since the beginning of the Trump administration, clean energy projects that were projected to create hundreds of jobs in Arizona were [cancelled or stalled](https://azmirror.com/2025/07/09/trumps-tax-bill-eliminates-clean-energy-incentives-costing-arizona-billions/).

-   Biggs was a climate denier, who) called global warming a [“left-wing hoax”](https://x.com/RepAndyBiggsAZ/status/1983559813129720088) and a [“discredited theory,”](https://www.axios.com/2017/12/15/house-republican-introduces-measure-to-defund-key-climate-research-1513305154) and claimed there were [“credible scientists”](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2017/04/12/andy-biggs-town-hall-arizona/100124436/)  who did not believe in climate change.

**Message:** Biggs voted to kill job opportunities for Arizonans to give tax cuts to billionaires. 

### **BIGGS WAS AN ANTI-ABORTION EXTREMIST**

- Andy Biggs was an out-of-touch anti-abortion extremist, who [said](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/andy-biggs-todd-starnes-show-9321/s-XoQ0Qy0Zpxu?si=7ac130d39f5a40dd988b2d422702b1a6&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) he could not support anyone who backed abortion rights.

- In Congress, Biggs repeatedly voted to strip Americans of their reproductive rights. Biggs [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll360.xml) against codifying abortion protections in federal law, claiming it would expand a procedure that “[killed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMipJIB36BY) an estimated 62 million babies since Roe v. Wade.” He [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll362.xml) against protecting out-of-state abortion services and protecting interstate movement of FDA-approved abortion drugs. Biggs also [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll385.xml) against codifying the right to access contraception in federal law.

- Biggs introduced anti-abortion legislation to impose [ultrasound mandates](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4416859-biggs-abortion-bill-ultrasound-images-consent/) and [deny abortion as health care,](https://x.com/RepAndyBiggsAZ/status/1128830172143247360?s=20) and worked to [strip](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/andy-biggs-dewey-meet-greet-81225/s-6PJYq8Cs75a?si=441ec3752ec84453acfa2e25f2876f60&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) international law language protecting reproductive rights. He also supported [defunding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWo2Jl305WQ) Planned Parenthood.

- Biggs referred to abortion as [“murder”](https://x.com/RepAndyBiggsAZ/status/1841294008821096928?s=20) and [“killing”](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/andy-biggs-tele-town-hall-93021/s-951dvLaNZHY?si=98e04250b246441e8b16e9ec6fe0aea5&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) the unborn, and falsely [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJO-pJXuPvY) that a fetus “may feel pain as early as 12 weeks.”

**Message:** Biggs threatened the reproductive freedoms of Arizonans.

### **BIGGS SIDED WITH CORPORATE PROFITS OVER ARIZONANS’ WORKER SAFETY**

- Biggs sided with corporate profits over Arizonans’ worker safety as he worked to remove workplace safety protections, including trying to [abolish](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/nation/2025/02/06/why-andy-biggs-wants-to-dismantle-osha/78252842007/) the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 

- Biggs [filed](https://ogletree.com/insights-resources/blog-posts/member-of-congress-introduces-bill-to-abolish-occupational-safety-and-health-administration/) legislation to dismantle OSHA, the agency credited with [improving](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/lawmaker-introduces-bill-to-demolish-workplace-safety-agency-slams-bloated-federal-government/) workplace safety without illegal [retaliation](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/nation/2025/02/06/why-andy-biggs-wants-to-dismantle-osha/78252842007/) and setting [standards](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/lawmaker-introduces-bill-to-demolish-workplace-safety-agency-slams-bloated-federal-government/) to protect workers from asbestos, arsenic, benzene, lead, cotton dust, and other carcinogens. Without OSHA holding corporations accountable, employers would be enabled to further [neglect](https://www.workerscompensation.com/daily-headlines/the-potential-fallout-of-eliminating-osha/) workplace safety and working conditions for Arizonans would worsen.

**Message:** Biggs would worsen workplace conditions for Arizonans as he sided with corporate profits over worker safety.

### **BIGGS VOTED TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES AFTER 11 MONTHS, ONLY BECAUSE TRUMP FINALLY APPROVED OF THE RELEASE**

-  It took Biggs 11 months to [vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml) for the release of the Epstein files, only after [Trump](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/16/nx-s1-5610552/trump-house-republicans-epstein-files) told House Republicans he approved of the release. 

-   Biggs [touted](https://x.com/RepAndyBiggsAZ/status/1990943599891218510) his vote for the release of the Epstein files, defending Trump and claiming he supported transparency, but he never signed the discharge petition, never co-sponsored the legislation, and previously voted against the release of the files. In [July](https://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml) and [September 2025,](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll222.xml) Biggs cast the deciding votes against [releasing the Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj), protecting the accused pedophiles named within them.

**Message:** Despite previously voting against releasing the Epstein files, Biggs ultimately voted for the release of the Epstein files only because Trump approved of the release.
