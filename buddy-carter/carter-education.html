<h2><strong>Carter Backed Trump’s Gutting Public Education</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Carter Praised Trump’s Attacks On The Department Of Education</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Carter Celebrated Trump’s Executive Order Shuttering The Department Of Education</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] Carter Said The US Was “Winning” Thanks To Trump’s Executive Order Closing The Department Of Education And “Putting Parents And Communities, Not The Federal Government, Back In Charge Of Our Children's Education.”</strong> “First of all, folks, let me ask you a question. Are you tired of winning yet? And we are winning. Just last week, the president signed an executive order putting parents and communities, not the federal government, back in charge of our children's education. I applaud this. I think this is the way to go. I've always felt that education should be at the at the closest level that it could be to to the people and pushing it back to the state and local level. This is a step in the right direction. And, um, President Trump, that that's what he's trying to do” [Carter Telephone Town Hall, 3/24/25]</p>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] Carter Supported Transferring Student Loan Administration To The SBA And “The Special Needs” To HHS; He Was “Happy” And “Delighted” With Trump’s Education Plans.</strong> “Now, look, these programs are not going to be eliminated. They are being. For instance, the student loans are being transferred to the Small Business Administration, where Kelly Loeffler is. The other areas are being transferred. What was it I heard today? He's being transferred to HHS. Um, the special needs. Special needs is being transferred to HHS. The low income will continue to be there but will be transferred to another department. So, it'll be administered through another department. It is not being eliminated. It's still going to be there. Oh, I am happy, and I'm delighted. And it's ecstatic about what the president's doing and doing away with the Department of Education.” [Carter Telephone Town Hall, 3/24/25]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Carter Was Eager To Decimate The Department Of Education</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] Carter Was “Excited” For DOE’s Dismantlement And Claimed That “It Can Save Us A Lot Of Money.”</strong> “HOST: But I do want to point out part of that is manifesting itself today in the the beginning of the dismantling of the Department of Education. It seems like that's going to that's going to be something that could save us a lot of money, huh? CARTER: Absolutely. It can save us a lot of money. But I think more importantly, I'm excited about it. It pushes education back down to the local level where it should be.” [Scott Ryfun Show, 3/20/25]</p>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] Carter Pointed To DOE As Evidence Of The “Bloated Bureaucracy” And Claimed They Were “Trying To Push It Back Down To The Local Level.”</strong> “And that's and and that's important to note, because we as I said earlier, we've got a bloated bureaucracy now. We've got too many people who are dependent on the government. And speaking of our forefathers, we just were. That's not what they intended for it to be. In fact, just the opposite. They wanted the federal government to be secondary, if you will, to the state governments. And that's you know, you look at what the president is trying to do with Department of Education. Now, I had a at school board member that I spoke to earlier this week and yesterday and and at the parade in Savannah and she was telling me, you know what's going to happen to Department of Education. I said, are you excited? I said, We're trying to push it back down to the local level and to give you more authority.” [Martha Zoller Show, 3/18/25]</p>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Carter Supported “Shutting Down The Department Of Education,” Calling The Proposal A “Good Idea,” And Thought That “Education Should Be Back To The States.”</strong> “HOST: Well, I'm curious. There's a whole lot of things being discussed. I mean, shutting down the Department of Education, drastically reducing the IRS. You think those are good ideas? CARTER: I do. I think education should be back to the states and the decisions made at the local level are much better than the decisions made in in Washington, D.C. That's why I think that the education of our children should be the responsibility of the states. And I applaud the president for what he's trying to do there. And and certainly some of the some of the findings that we are having as a result of DOGE are leading us to understand better what what is the role of federal government.” [Allen Jackson Now, 3/11/25]</p>
