<h2><strong>Carter Was An Election Denier Who Voted Against The 2020 Election’s Certification</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Carter Objected To The 2020 Election’s Certification</strong></h3>
<p><strong>January 6, 2021: Carter Voted To Uphold Objections To The Certification Of The 2020 Electoral College Votes In Pennsylvania And Arizona And Stated His Objections To Georgia’s Electoral College Votes.</strong> According to the Savannah Morning News, “Wednesday’s attack on the U.S. Capitol building by a large pro-Trump mob didn’t change 1st District Rep. Buddy Carter’s mind on voting to overturn the presidential election results. Carter, who was reelected on Nov. 3, voted to uphold objections to the certification of the Electoral College votes in Pennsylvania and Arizona on Wednesday night and early Thursday morning. Carter and other Republicans in favor of the objections have only found fault with the presidential results. Since Carter stated he had objections to votes in Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia, he apparently would have made the same vote to object to the voters’ choice in Georgia if Sen. Kelly Loeffler had not revoked her objection. Carter said on Twitter Thursday that he objected to Georgia because of changes made by the secretary of state in March not approved by the Georgia General Assembly.” [Savannah Morning News, <a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/story/news/2021/01/07/trump-qanon-capitol-attack-2020-election-results-buddy-carter-vote-to-overturn-joe-biden/6585886002/"><u>1/7/21</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Carter Refused To Explain His Objections But Condemned The Insurrectionists’ Actions In A Twitter Video.</strong> According to the Savannah Morning News, “Carter has not responded to requests to explain his position. He did, however, take to Twitter to speak about the issue. ‘When the Capitol was stormed, when the House chamber was stormed by a few who got out of control....actions have consequences and these people should be prosecuted -- what they did I condemn,’ Carter said in a Twitter video. Carter said he was not questioning the election results, only the process.” [Savannah Morning News, <a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/story/news/2021/01/07/trump-qanon-capitol-attack-2020-election-results-buddy-carter-vote-to-overturn-joe-biden/6585886002/"><u>1/7/21</u></a>]</li>

<h3><strong>Carter Was An Election Denier</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Carter Declared That It Would Be “A Cold Day In Hell” Before He Apologized For Voting To Overturn The 2020 Election</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Carter Thought The Democrats’ Outrage Over His Attempt To Overturn The 2020 Election Was “Ridiculous” And Declared, “It Will Be A Cold Day In Hell Before I Apologize To Her For My Vote On January 6th.” </strong>According to The Washington Post, “‘Listen, it is ridiculous. If we’re going to hold somebody responsible for every vote that they’ve made, none of us are going to be able to work together,’ Rep. Earl L. ‘Buddy’ Carter (R-Ga.) said. ‘This is an important issue, it’s a bipartisan issue. [Dean’s] stand is completely wrong. She wanted me to apologize. It will be a cold day in hell before I apologize to her for my vote on January 6th.’ Two years ago, Carter signed on as the lead Republican to legislation drafted by Dean to combat the opioid epidemic, but after his Jan. 6 vote against Biden’s victory, Dean would allow Carter only to be an ordinary co-sponsor of the anti-opioid bill.” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/capitol-riots-house/2021/05/14/709203c0-b4d3-11eb-ab43-bebddc5a0f65_story.html"><u>5/15/21</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Carter Whipped Votes Against Legislation To Combat The Opioid Epidemic In Protest Of How Democrats Treated Him Over His January 6th Vote. </strong>According to The Washington Post, “It was scheduled on a fast-track, because the original version passed unanimously last year, so it required a two-thirds majority for approval. Instead, Carter asked Republicans to vote against the otherwise-popular measure to protest how Democrats treated him, and Republicans in general. It failed Tuesday, receiving just 250 votes, and Democrats will now have to schedule a more time-consuming process to approve the bill.” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/capitol-riots-house/2021/05/14/709203c0-b4d3-11eb-ab43-bebddc5a0f65_story.html"><u>5/15/21</u></a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Carter Previously Tried To Distance Himself From Voter Fraud Allegations And Claimed That His 2020 Objection Was “With The Process.” </strong>According to Reuters, “Ten Republicans say election was NOT stolen - after voting to overturn it. Most of the 10 Republican lawmakers who now say they don’t believe Trump lost a rigged election had previously issued relatively mild statements that avoided any direct allegation of fraud. Exceptions are Rep. Lauren Boebert from Colorado and Rep. Madison Cawthorn from North Carolina, both newly elected in November. [...] Rep. Buddy Carter Ga. 1 ‘I have been very, very cautious not to indicate in any way that there has been any voter fraud,’ Carter said in an interview with Reuters. ‘I’ve made it a point, that I have not said that at all. I’ve not lent any credence whatsoever to any kind of conspiracy theories. My problem is with the process.’” [Reuters, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-TRUMP/LAWMAKERS/xegpbedzdvq/"><u>2/4/21</u></a>]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Carter Swore He Would Never Recant His Vote To Overturn The 2020 Election And Declared That He “Would Do Over 100 Times If I Had The Opportunity Because I Feel Very Strongly.” </strong>According to The Washington Post, “Carter said that he will never do the one thing Democrats want — recant his Jan. 6 vote — and he understands the fallout. He believes that state judges made rulings in three states that overstepped their legal boundaries during the election, and he is content with his vote. ‘The bigger issue itself is the objection to the electoral certification, which I did do, and I would do over 100 times if I had the opportunity because I feel very strongly,’ Carter said.” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/capitol-riots-house/2021/05/14/709203c0-b4d3-11eb-ab43-bebddc5a0f65_story.html"><u>5/15/21</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Carter Joined Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s Attempt To Overturn The 2020 Election And Invalidate Election Results In Four States</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>December 2020: Carter Joined An Amicus Brief To Overturn The Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, And Wisconsin Election Results And Claimed That Paxton’s Case Was “About Protecting The Constitution And Our Elections.”</strong> According to a press release from Representative Buddy Carter, “Earl L. ‘Buddy’ Carter (R-Ga.) today filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of the Texas v. Pennsylvania, et al. case. Recently, the Texas Attorney General filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court to invalidate the presidential elections in four states, arguing that those states used the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to unlawfully change election laws and weaken the integrity of the election. The amicus brief signed by 106 Members of Congress ensures the Supreme Court is aware of the crucial facts in the case that Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin unconstitutionally bypassed their state legislatures to change how presidential electors are chosen. ‘This case is about protecting the Constitution and our elections,’ said Carter. ‘The Constitution is clear - only state legislatures can change how presidential electors are chosen. Whether you are a Democrat, Independent, or Republican, we should all agree that we need fair, honest, and transparent elections. The Supreme Court needs to ensure the integrity of our elections.’” [Press Release – Representative Buddy Carter, <a href="https://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=7739"><u>12/10/20</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Carter Defended His Joining The Amicus And Alleged That Georgia Secretary Of State Brad Raffensperger Exceeded His Office’s Authority.</strong> According to Savannah Now, “U.S. Congressman Buddy Carter of the 1st District (R) had joined 125 other Republican members of Congress in signing an amicus brief, a friend of the court brief, supporting the Texas lawsuit. Shortly before the Supreme Court’s ruling, Carter explained his action. ‘This isn’t about the election,’ Carter said. ‘This is about the Constitution.’ Carter said the question for him is about authority, specifically that exercised by Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in the 2020 election. Carter challenged Raffensperger's decision to allow county election officials to begin processing absentee ballots prior to Election Day. Carter also alleges Raffensperger made changes in ballot signature requirements. ‘Did the secretary of state have the authority to make election changes without the approval of the General Assembly?’ Carter said.” [Savannah Now, <a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/story/news/2020/12/12/savannah-congressman-buddy-carter-amicus-brief-texas-election-suit-republican-trump-biden/6516358002/"><u>12/12/20</u></a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Supreme Court Threw Out Paxton’s Lawsuit And Declared That Texas Lacked “A Judicially Cognizable Interest In The Manner In Which Another State Conducts Its Elections.” </strong>According to The Texas Tribune, “Briskly rejecting a long-shot but high-stakes case, the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday tossed out the Texas lawsuit that had become a vehicle for Republicans across the country to contest President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. In a few brief sentences, the high court said it would not consider the case for procedural reasons, because Texas lacked standing to bring it. ‘Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections,’ the court wrote in an unsigned ruling Friday evening.” [Texas Tribune, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/12/11/texas-lawsuit-supreme-court-election-results/"><u>12/11/20</u></a>]</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><u>Carter Later Flip-Flopped For The Midterms And Called For January 6th Prosecutions</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2022: Carter Thought January 6th Insurrectionists “Should Be Arrested” And “Should Have Their Due Process.”</strong> According to Savannah Morning News, ‘On his reaction once he learned what was going on outside the House chambers: "I remember I was so upset and so angry and I was hollered at them, saying, 'Stop. Stop doing this. This is not right. This is stupid.'’On his feelings about the siege one year later: ‘I condemn the actions of these people. This is not what America is about.’ On punishing those who participated: ‘You have every right to protest, but you have to do it in a civil way. ... They should be arrested. They should have their due process, as any criminal should have ... and they should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Because what they did was wrong.’” [Savannah Morning News, <a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/story/opinion/2022/01/06/january-6-us-capitol-attack-buddy-carter-donald-trump-ga/9101047002/"><u>1/6/22</u></a>]</p>
