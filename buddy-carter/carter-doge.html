<h2><strong>Carter Backed DOGE Efforts At Georgians’ Expense</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Carter Flip-Flopped On USAID Funding</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Carter Mocked USAID’s Initiatives And Celebrated Elon Musk’s Funding Cuts…</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>March 2025: Carter Said Musk’s Cuts “Resulted In Estimated Savings Of $105 Billion” And Claimed That USAID “Obligated $2 Million For Sex Changes And LGBTQ Activism In Guatemala,” “$4.5 Million To ‘Combat Disinformation’ In Kazakhstan, And “$7.9 Million To Teach Sri Lankan Journalists To Avoid ‘Binary-Gendered Language.’” </strong>According to a Washington Times op-ed by Representative Buddy Carter, “Together with Elon Musk, this administration is eliminating waste, fraud and abuse from our government, addressing the $36 trillion in federal debt that is crippling our nation. Already, the efforts of the Department of Government Efficiency have resulted in estimated savings of $105 billion. The waste that DOGE has uncovered is truly stunning. Through the U.S. Agency for International Development alone, the Biden administration obligated $2 million for sex changes and LGBTQ activism in Guatemala, $4.5 million to ‘combat disinformation’ in Kazakhstan, $7.9 million to teach Sri Lankan journalists to avoid ‘binary-gendered language,’ and the list goes on.” [Representative Buddy Carter Op-Ed – Washington Times, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/mar/11/trump-restoring-common-sense-america/"><u>3/11/25</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>[AUDIO] Carter Mocked USAID’s “$2 Million For Sex Change And LGBT Activism In Guatemala” And “$4.5 Million To Combat Disinformation In Kazakhstan”; He Admitted That He Did Not “Even Know Where Kazakhstan Is” On A Map.</strong> “CARTER: But but, you know, again, some of this money that we're looking at and I just want to give you an example here, USA, USA, USAID, that, you know, they were sending $2 million for sex change and LGBT activism in Guatemala. $2 million. HOST: Yeah. CARTER: Now, you know, in Washington we talk billions and trillions. But 2 trillion dollars is a lot of money. They were sending $6 million to fund terrorism in Egypt, over $4.5 million to combat disinformation in Kazakhstan. I don't even know where Kazakhstan is. $4.5 million. That's a lot of money. And all of this is taxpayers’ money. And and you pointed out earlier, Scott, we we are running a budget deficit of $2 trillion every year, and we're just digging a hole deeper as we get more and more in debt here, sending these kind of this kind of money over to other countries.” [Scott Ryfun Show, 3/20/25]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>February 2025: Carter Claimed That USAID Was “One Of The Most Egregious Offenders Of Waste, Fraud, And Abuse That We Have Ever Seen” And Alleged That The Organization Funded “Woke, Radical, DEI Nonsense Not Only In America, But Around The Globe.”</strong> According to The Current, “Can the U.S. government no longer afford foreign aid? Coastal Georgia’s representative in Congress, Earl ‘Buddy’ Carter, appears to believe so. Or maybe not. In his weekly newsletter, emailed to constituents on Sunday, Carter lambastes the primary agency that distributes foreign aid, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), describing it as ‘one of the most egregious offenders of waste, fraud, and abuse that we have ever seen.’ Carter says USAID is among those federal government departments that are tools of ‘democrat agents and bureaucrats’ that have been using taxpayer dollars to ‘fund woke, radical, DEI nonsense not only in America, but around the globe.’” [Current, <a href="https://thecurrentga.org/today-from-the-current/aid-cuts-hit-south-georgia/"><u>2/11/25</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>[VIDEO] Carter Bemoaned USAID’s Alleged “$15 Million For Condoms For The Taliban” And “$47,000 For A Transgender Opera In Colombia.”</strong> “HOST: Does DOGE’s authority supersede your own and your colleagues? CARTER: No, it does not. Of course it doesn’t. And look, the aid that was, the U.S. aid that was cut off should have been cut off. I mean, $15 million for condoms for the Taliban? And you know, $47,000 to a transgender opera in Colombia– HOST: $15 million for condoms for the Taliban? CARTER: That's what they discovered. I mean– HOST: Are you conflating things? Is this, are you, are you talking about the $50 million that was supposedly meant for condoms in Gaza. Are you conflating those two things? CARTER: I am not. I am not.” [CNN: Newsroom, <a href="https://grabien.com/file/getmedia?id=2791290&amp;key=3847059db4e8745964e982b1131af236&amp;userid=10270"><u>2/6/25</u></a>]</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><u>…But Carter Previously Voted Against Legislation To Defund USAID And Lauded Their International Efforts</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2024: Carter Voted To Protect USAID’s Funding.</strong> According to The Current, “The five-term congressman from St. Simons hasn’t always been so scathing about USAID, which was created in 1961. Last year, he voted against a bill to defund the agency, much to the dismay of U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Rome), who sponsored the measure.” [Current, <a href="https://thecurrentga.org/today-from-the-current/aid-cuts-hit-south-georgia/"><u>2/11/25</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>2024: Carter Visited Rwanda And Tanzania, Where He Praised USAID Recipient Organizations And Emphasized The Importance Of Increasing American Ties In Sub-Saharan Africa To Reduce Their Ties To China.</strong> According to The Current, “Also last year, Carter joined more than a dozen other representatives, on a weeklong visit to Rwanda and Tanzania. After the visit, he praised organizations who hosted the delegation, some of which have been recipients of USAID funds. He also stressed the importance of increasing ties with nations in sub-Saharan Africa to reduce their ties to China and ensure a steady supply of critical minerals to the U.S.” [Current, <a href="https://thecurrentga.org/today-from-the-current/aid-cuts-hit-south-georgia/"><u>2/11/25</u></a>]</p>
<h3><strong>Carter Backed DOGE’s Effort To Repeal Inflation Reduction Act Tax Credits</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Carter Supported The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s” IRA Tax Credit Repeals, Despite The Seven Projects And 4,462 Jos They Created In His District. </strong>According to Inside Climate News, “Others who said they supported tax credits come from heavily Republican districts that have major projects funded in part by the IRA. This includes Rep. Buddy Carter of Georgia, who has seven projects and 4,462 jobs in his district related to the law, and still voted for the bill. ‘This is a once-in-a-generation bill that will unlock President Trump’s full domestic agenda, which Georgians voted for overwhelmingly back in November,’ Carter said in a statement after the vote. ‘With the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act we are unleashing our nation’s energy dominance, securing the border, putting more money back into hardworking Americans’ wallets, kicking illegal immigrants off Medicaid so that it is available for those who need it, and ending the waste, fraud, and abuse that risks sending our country into economic ruin.’” [Inside Climate News, <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22052025/inside-clean-energy-republican-ira-repeal/"><u>5/22/25</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Carter Previously Signed A Letter Calling To Protect The Clean Energy Credits–And Thereby Hyundai’s $5.5 Billion Electric Vehicle, Hybrid, And Battery Manufacturing Plant In Carter’s District–But Decided To Support The ‘Big Beautiful’ Bill And Its Tax Credit Elimination Because He Wanted To “Unleash Energy Dominance.”</strong> According to The New York Times, “President Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ bill has stopped the Solarcycle factory in its tracks. The legislation, which passed the House and is now being debated in the Senate, would essentially eliminate the tax breaks that companies have been counting on to build new wind and solar projects, electric vehicle battery factories and more. Republicans in the House voted to get rid of the clean energy subsidies in order to pay for Mr. Trump’s income tax breaks, even if it meant hurting investment in their districts. [...] It turns out that Republicans feared defying Mr. Trump more than they feared endangering jobs, analysts said. “Voting no would have been a career-ender,” said Brian Robinson, a Republican political consultant in Georgia. Among the Republicans who voted for Mr. Trump’s tax bill was Representative Buddy Carter. His southeast Georgia district is home to a $5.5 billion Hyundai electric vehicle, hybrid and battery manufacturing plant. Mr. Carter had previously signed a letter with 17 other House Republicans calling to protect clean energy credits. But Mr. Carter, who is running for a Senate seat, said he ultimately voted for Mr. Trump’s package because he wanted to ‘unleash energy dominance’ and to cut taxes for his constituents.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/07/climate/republicans-clean-energy-credits-georgia.html"><u>6/7/25</u></a>]</p>
<h3><strong>Carter Celebrated DOGE’s Federal Cuts And Firings</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Carter Wanted Federal Employees To Prove They’re “Efficient” And Take A Salary Cut</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Carter Thought A Blanket 1% Reduction In Federal Salaries Was “A Great Idea” That Federal Employees Would Not Notice, “With All Due Respect To My Staff And Those On The Federal Payroll.”</strong> “HOST: The poll says that voters still want more federal belt tightening and that 53% support a 1% annual payroll cut at every federal agency. 1% would hardly get noticed, but over ten years, that would save $1.9 trillion. What do you think of that idea? CARTER: It's a great idea. Look, and you know, with all due respect to my staff and and those on the federal payroll, look, I mean, I appreciate what DOGE doing. I appreciate the suggestion here of how we can save money.” [Allen Jackson Now, 3/11/25]</p>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Carter: “I Hate For Anyone To Lose Their Job, But, You Know, Show Me What You're Doing And Show Me That It's Efficient.”</strong> “You know, I hate for anyone to lose their job, but, you know, show me what you're doing and show me that it's efficient. Show me that, that we really, truly need as big of a bureaucracy as we got. When you have a bloated bureaucracy like we have , you're going to have waste, you're going to have abuse. We need to identify that. We need to be more efficient.” [WALB, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNheInPMp68"><u>3/4/25</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Carter Preemptively Dismissed Problems From DOGE’s Indiscriminate Funding Cuts</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] Carter Said Americans Were “Going To Have To Suck It Up” Because The DOGE Cuts Were “Going To Be Uncomfortable, Uncomfortable For All Of Us.”</strong> “And if you can cut the debt, you can bring inflation down. The more the the more money the government spends, the less money you have. And we need we need to understand that it is true. And that's why we need to cut our debt. And everybody's going to have to suck it up. And we're just going to have to make cuts that are going to be uncomfortable, uncomfortable for all of us.” [Politically Georgia, 12/6/24]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Carter Feverishly Praised DOGE’s Cuts To The Federal Government</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Carter Listed 100 DOGE-Cancelled Programs And Claimed That Trump “Saved More Than $100 Billion In 100 Days.” </strong>According to an X op-ed by Representative Buddy Carter, “Through the Department of Government Efficiency, President Trump has prioritized ending the reckless spending of the Biden-Harris era, restoring fiscal sanity and putting taxpayers, not foreign governments, first. The proof is in the receipts, and today, I’m bringing them. The Trump administration saved more than $100 billion in 100 days in part by cancelling these 100 programs, grants, and contracts:” [Representative Buddy Carter Op-Ed – X, <a href="https://x.com/RepBuddyCarter/status/1917209774904520789"><u>4/29/25</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Carter Bemoaned “DEI Contracts At The Department Of Education,” Including “The Complex Histories Involved In Oppression,” And Listed 99 Other Generally Described Budget Items With Their Alleged Costs, Including “DEI-Related Contracts” And “Iraqi Sesame Street.” </strong>According to an X op-ed by Representative Buddy Carter, “1. $101 million: 29 DEI contracts at the Department of Education, including a contract for helping ‘students understand / interrogate the complex histories involved in oppression, and help students recognize areas of privilege and power on an individual and collective basis’ 2. $2 billion: A nonprofit linked to Stacey Abrams [...] 13. $1 billion: 104 DEI-related contracts 14. $45 million: DEI scholarship in Burma 15. $784 million: A contract to build a new embassy in South Sudan 16. $20 million: Iraqi Sesame Street 17. $2 million: Sex changes and ‘LGBT activism’ in Guatemala 18. $15 million: Oral contraceptives and condoms in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan 19. $60 billion: 15,000 foreign funding grants through the State Department” [Representative Buddy Carter Op-Ed – X, <a href="https://x.com/RepBuddyCarter/status/1917209774904520789"><u>4/29/25</u></a>]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Carter Claimed That Democrats “Should Be Applauding What Elon Musk And DOGE Is Doing Because They're Identifying Waste, Fraud And Abuse.”</strong> “HOST: So tell us how you really feel about if they want Elon Musk fired or not. What do you think these Democrats are going to do once Elon Musk goes back to the private sector? CARTER: You know there is, Democrats love big government. There's no question about that. And we should be applauding, they should be applauding what Elon Musk and DOGE is doing because they're identifying waste, fraud and abuse where all taxpayers he's saving all of us money, whether you're Republican or Democrat.” [FNC: Fox &amp; Friends First, <a href="https://grabien.com/file/getmedia?id=2887872&amp;key=6aaad3d09e1a6a53026f2cbcd2c87c2d&amp;userid=10270"><u>4/11/25</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>[VIDEO] Carter Declared That “We Should Be Applauding Him And Thanking Him For Helping Us To Make Government More Efficient.”</strong> “The Democrats right now, they're just lost in the wilderness. They have no vision, They have no leader, they have no plan. And because of that, they're just drawing for anything that they can get. And now he's a target. And I can assure you we should be applauding him and thanking him for helping us to make government more efficient. And that's what the people of America want. They want an efficient government. They want to end waste, fraud and abuse.” [FNC: Fox &amp; Friends First, <a href="https://grabien.com/file/getmedia?id=2887872&amp;key=6aaad3d09e1a6a53026f2cbcd2c87c2d&amp;userid=10270"><u>4/11/25</u></a>]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] Carter Said That Gutting The Federal Bureaucracy Was “Not Rocket Science” And Wanted The Congressional DOGE Caucus To Permanentize Musk’s Cuts To Ensure It Was “Once And For All Taken Care Of.”</strong> “HOST: I heard one of your colleagues discussing this yesterday and basically saying it's as simple as, you know, getting the report from Elon Musk or from DOGE and then adding some language to it and then getting it through. I mean, this is not once he identifies things, it will not be that difficult to get rid of them. CARTER: No, it's not rocket science. I mean, it's you know, we do legislation all the time and it is basically straightforward, as you indicated. And and and that's our responsibility. But without codifying it, then, you know, you really haven't achieved anything because then it can happen again. And and that's that's not what we want. We want this once and for all taken care of.” [Martha Zoller Show, 3/18/25]</p>
<p><strong>Carter: “Every Taxpayer Should Be Happy With What DOGE Has Accomplished Thus Far.” </strong>According to the Washington Examiner, “‘Every taxpayer should be happy with what DOGE has accomplished thus far,’ Rep.
