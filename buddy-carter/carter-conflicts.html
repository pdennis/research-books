<h2><strong>Carter Faced Conflict Of Interest Questions Over Self-Advantageous Legislation And Committee Assignments</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>2016: Carter Faced Ethics Concerns Over His Pursuit Of A Position On The House Energy And Commerce Committee, Overseeing Prescription Drug Pricing&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Carter, Who Previously Owned Several Pharmacies And Maintained Close Ties With The Pharmaceutical Industry, Sought An Oversight Position On Prescription Drug Price Increases And The User Fees Aimed At Expediting The Review Of Pharmaceuticals And Medical Devices</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Carter Pursued A Seat On The Committee Overseeing Prescription Drug Price Increases And The User Fees Aimed At Expediting The Review Of Pharmaceuticals And Medical Devices.</strong> According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter has made clear that he would like nothing more than a seat on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee when Congress reconvenes in the new year. The placement is a highly prized one. The committee is one of the last remaining legislative powerhouses on Capitol Hill, with a wide jurisdiction over health care, energy, manufacturing and telecommunications. Big donors tend to come with it. And as Carter, R-Pooler, notes in his pitch to colleagues, Energy and Commerce oversees prescription drug price increases and the user fees aimed at expediting the review of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/congressman-pharmaceutical-interests-raise-questions/nEZSpjmhFCcqKMcSUj8OfN/"><u>12/16/16</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Carter Faced Scrutiny Over His Previous Ownership Of Three Local Pharmacies And His Wife’s Continued Pharmacy Ownership.</strong> According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “It’s common for members of Congress with specific professional expertise to join the Capitol Hill committees that oversee the industries in which they once worked. The House Ethics Committee allows lawmakers to vote on legislation that could benefit their industry, but not on anything that would directly benefit themselves. In Carter’s case, the outside scrutiny focuses on his past ownership of three local pharmacies. When Carter arrived in Congress in early 2015, he transferred ownership of those businesses to his wife in order to comply with House rules, according to financial disclosure forms. Two of those pharmacies have since been sold, Carter said.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/congressman-pharmaceutical-interests-raise-questions/nEZSpjmhFCcqKMcSUj8OfN/"><u>12/16/16</u></a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Carter Maintained Close Ties To The Pharmaceutical Industry, Traveling On Their Dime And Accepting Over $220,000 In Political Contributions From Industry PACs.</strong> According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “Since arriving on Capitol Hill two years ago, Carter has kept his close ties to the pharmaceutical world. He’s traveled on the dime of several industry trade groups to speak at a handful of conferences in cities such as Las Vegas and St. Augustine, Fla., according to the nonpartisan LegiStorm, which compiles federal data on privately funded lawmaker trips. His campaign committee has raised upward of $220,000 over the past two years from the political action committees of pharmaceutical companies and individuals who work in the industry, an Atlanta Journal-Constitution review of federal filings found. And that doesn’t include the dozens of other health care-related groups who have also given to Carter’s re-election campaign.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/congressman-pharmaceutical-interests-raise-questions/nEZSpjmhFCcqKMcSUj8OfN/"><u>12/16/16</u></a>]</li>

<h4><strong><u>Ethics Watchdogs Thought Carter’s Pursuit Of The Committee Position Was A Clear Violation With The Potential To Enrich Carter And His Family</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Georgia Ethics Watchdogs Warned That Carter’s Pursuit Of The Committee Position “Violates Most People’s Common Sense Understanding Of Conflict Of Interest And Ethics.”</strong> According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “That fact has raised questions among good government advocates about whether conflicts of interest would arise should Carter, a pharmacist before he was elected to Congress, be appointed to the panel. ‘There’s certainly what is defined as conflict of interest by law and there’s conflict of interest by common sense,’ said William Perry, the head of Georgia Ethics Watchdogs, ‘and what Buddy Carter’s doing violates most people’s common sense understanding of conflict of interest and ethics.’” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/congressman-pharmaceutical-interests-raise-questions/nEZSpjmhFCcqKMcSUj8OfN/"><u>12/16/16</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Good Governance Groups Warned That Carter’s Position On The Committee Position&nbsp; Would Allow Him To Vote On Legislation Benefitting The Businesses He Transferred To His Wife; They Believed He Should Not Pursue Committee Assignments When “He’s Going To Continue To Have Immediate Family Members Owning His Businesses Who Would Financially Benefit From Some Of These Measures.”</strong> According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “Ethics watchdogs say that an appointment to the House Energy and Commerce Committee would put Carter in position to vote on legislation that could benefit the business that he transferred to his wife. That would violate the spirit of the ethics rules, they say. Brinkley Serkedakis, the director of the Georgia branch of the good government group Common Cause, said Carter should not be seeking the committee assignment. ‘I think that if he’s going to continue to have immediate family members owning his businesses who would financially benefit from some of these measures, then no, he shouldn’t be doing it,’ Serkedakis said.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/congressman-pharmaceutical-interests-raise-questions/nEZSpjmhFCcqKMcSUj8OfN/"><u>12/16/16</u></a>]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Carter Downplayed The Ethics Concerns And Claimed It Would Be “Irresponsible Of Me Not To Use My Expertise From Years In Health Care To Participate In The Discussion Of Health Care.”</strong> According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “Carter said he’s been in constant touch with the House Ethics Committee to make sure he wasn’t breaking any rules. ‘I don’t think there’s any conflict of interest whatsoever,’ he said in an interview Friday. ‘I think it would be irresponsible of me not to use my expertise from years in health care to participate in the discussion of health care.’” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/congressman-pharmaceutical-interests-raise-questions/nEZSpjmhFCcqKMcSUj8OfN/"><u>12/16/16</u></a>]</p>
<h3><strong>2016: Carter Co-Sponsored Legislation Affording Pharmacists With “Provider Status” And Benefiting His Pharmacy Businesses</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Described Carter As “A Vocal Advocate Of The Pharmacy Lobby’s Top Issues” And Alleged That His Legislation Affording Pharmacists “Provider Status” Would “Benefit His Pharmacy Business.”</strong> According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter is under scrutiny for co-sponsoring legislation that could benefit his pharmacy business. A report by Fox 5 Atlanta questioned whether the Savannah Republican, a licensed pharmacist who owned pharmacies in south Georgia before he was elected in 2014, had a conflict of interest. Carter, who transferred his pharmacies to his wife, was the only pharmacist in Congress before November's election and a vocal advocate of the pharmacy lobby's top issues. He backed measures that would give seniors on Medicare more access to prescription drugs at their pharmacies and another that would give pharmacists ‘provider status’ to expand their scope of practice.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/buddy-carter-faces-conflict-interest-questions-over-pharmacy-bills/cS6MRQq7C7V2F4WVWURLbO/"><u>12/14/16</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Ethics Watchdogs Described Carter’s Legislation As A “Clear Violation Of The Spirit” Of House Ethics Rules But Carter Claimed The Legislation Was Written By Other Lawmakers. </strong>According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “Carter told Dale Russell the legislation was already written by other lawmakers before his election, and that the House Ethics Committee gave him verbal approval for his role. But Brinkley Serkedekis of the Common Cause transparency advocacy told Russell the legislation financially benefits Carter as well, making it a ‘clear violation of the spirit’ of House ethics rules.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/buddy-carter-faces-conflict-interest-questions-over-pharmacy-bills/cS6MRQq7C7V2F4WVWURLbO/"><u>12/14/16</u></a>]</p>
<h3><strong>2014: Carter, Who Was At This Time Still A Pharmacist, Introduced Legislation To Restrict Pharmacy Benefit Managers To The Benefit Of Pharmacists</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Carter Introduced Legislation In The Georgia Senate That Restricted Pharmacy Benefit Managers; His Critics Claimed It Would “Directly Benefit Pharmacists And Few Others.”</strong> According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “Similar questions arose in 2014, when as a state senator Carter introduced a bill that placed restrictions on pharmacy benefits managers, who administer prescription plans for insurance companies and negotiate the prices people pay for certain drugs. His critics said the bill would directly benefit pharmacists and few others.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/congressman-pharmaceutical-interests-raise-questions/nEZSpjmhFCcqKMcSUj8OfN/"><u>12/16/16</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Carter Stood By The Failed Legislation But Admitted That It Should Have Come From Another Lawmaker.</strong> According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “Carter stood by his work and framed it as a consumer-friendly bill, but he later acknowledged to Fox 5 that it should have been offered by another lawmaker. The measure failed to advance.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/congressman-pharmaceutical-interests-raise-questions/nEZSpjmhFCcqKMcSUj8OfN/"><u>12/16/16</u></a>]</p>
