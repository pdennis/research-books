<h2><strong>Carter Opposed The Affordable Care Act</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Carter Decried Affordable Care Act Subsidies And Opposed A Three-Year Extension&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Carter Decried The Enhanced Subsidies And Blamed The Democrats For Their Expiration; He Opposed A Three-Year Extension&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Carter Declared That “We've Got To Stop The Subsidies” And “Get This Spending Under Control.”</strong> “But at the same time, we've got to stop the subsidies. We've got to get this spending under control. This was never meant to be permanent. It was only to get us through the pandemic. And if the Democrats had wanted it to be permanent, they could have made it.” [FBN: Mornings With Maria B., <a href="https://youtu.be/-9A5zcU3MgQ"><u>9/23/25</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Carter Claimed That “Democrats Have Ruined Health Care In America With The Unaffordable Care Act” And Decried The Expiring Health Care Subsidies As Failed Policy.</strong> “We will, because this is the Unaffordable Care Act. I mean, Obamacare, the Democrats realized early on that it was unaffordable, and they started subsidizing it. And then when the COVID, when the pandemic started, we got the Biden COVID bonuses that they set to expire at the end of the pandemic. Now they want to extend them. This is not going to work. I think the Democrats have ruined health care in America with the Unaffordable Care Act.” [FNC: Fox News Live, <a href="https://youtu.be/1blEjLsHCjk"><u>11/2/25</u></a>]&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Carter Said The Subsides Were “Handouts To Big Insurance Companies” And Claimed That “We Should Be Empowering Patients With Affordable Health Care Options That Work Best For Them, Not The Government.” </strong>According to the Savannah Morning News, “Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to announce a ‘clean’ three-year extension of the tax credits on Thursday. The proposal needs 60 votes to advance to a final simple-majority vote in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the chamber's 100 seats. The extension faces scrutiny from Republican lawmakers, including Georgia's District 1 Representative Buddy Carter. ‘Democrats broke health care when they passed Obamacare,’ Carter said in an emailed statement to the Savannah Morning News. ‘It made health care more expensive, so they had to subsidize it.’ Carter entered the 2026 Senate race in May, joining other Republicans seeking to unseat Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff. ‘Instead of giving handouts to big insurance companies, which is what Jon Ossoff wants to continue to do, we should be empowering patients with affordable health care options that work best for them, not the government,’ Carter stated.” [Savannah Morning News, <a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/story/news/local/2025/12/10/congress-vote-could-double-healthcare-premiums-for-1-million-georgians/87691433007/?tbref=hp"><u>12/10/25</u></a>]</p>
<h5><i>Carter Praised Trump’s Proposal To Send The Subsidies Directly To Taxpayers But Again Decried The Subsidy Program</i></h5>
<p><strong>Carter Thought Trump’s Proposal Was “Was A Great Move On His Part” And “A Great Idea”; Carter Claimed That “Any Time You Have To Subsidize A Federal Program, That Means It's Not Working. And The Un-Affordable Care Act Is Not Working.” </strong>According to Newsmax, “Meanwhile, President Donald Trump helped force a resolution when he floated sending Obamacare subsidies directly to taxpayers rather than insurance companies. ‘This was a great move on his part,’ he said. ‘I was a small businessman. I had 25 employees, and I … always provided insurance for them.’ Still, Carter said he eventually provided his employees with a stipend, so they could get their own insurance on the competitive market, ‘and that's what the president is proposing here.’ ‘I love it,’ he added. ‘I think it's a great idea … we have the Affordable Care Act that's having to be subsidized, and remember, any time you have to subsidize a federal program, that means it's not working. And the Un-Affordable Care Act is not working.’” [Newsmax, <a href="https://www.newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/buddy-carter-shutdown-donald-trump/2025/11/11/id/1234078/"><u>11/11/25</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Carter Touted House Passage Of The GOP’s “Lower Health Care Premiums For All Americans Act” Which Allowed The Affordable Care Act’s Enhanced Premium Subsidies To Expire</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Carter Celebrated The Legislation And Claimed That “Republicans Began The Hard Work Of Undoing More Than A Decade Of Harm To Patients Nationwide”; He Promised Americans “Access To The High-Quality Health Care They Deserve At A Rate They Can Afford” Under The GOP’s New Framework”</strong> According to a press release from Representative Buddy Carter, “Carter (R-GA) today released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 6703, the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act, a bill lowering health care costs and providing American citizens with more affordable coverage: [...] ‘With this vote, House Republicans began the hard work of undoing more than a decade of harm to patients nationwide. By driving down health insurance premiums, increasing pharmacy benefit manager transparency, and expanding affordable health care options, we are ensuring that American citizens have access to the high-quality health care they deserve at a rate they can afford.’” [Press Release – Representative Buddy Carter, <a href="https://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=16052"><u>12/17/25</u></a>]</p>
<h5><i>Carter Celebrated The End Of The Premium Subsidies Under The GOP Bill</i></h5>
<p><strong>Carter Mocked “Liberal Politicians Like Jon Ossoff” Who Wanted “To Continue Giving Handouts To Big Insurance And Illegal Immigrants, Making Your Health Outcomes Worse, Instead Of Addressing The Heart Of The Problem, Which Is That The UnAffordable Care Act Isn’t Working.”</strong> According to a press release from Representative Buddy Carter, “Carter (R-GA) today released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 6703, the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act, a bill lowering health care costs and providing American citizens with more affordable coverage: ‘Liberal politicians like Jon Ossoff want to continue giving handouts to Big Insurance and illegal immigrants, making your health outcomes worse, instead of addressing the heart of the problem, which is that the UnAffordable Care Act isn’t working.

<p><strong>The Georgia Health Initiative Found That Without Enhanced Subsidies Premiums In Georgia Will More Than Double, From An Average Of $69 Per Month To $148 Per Month. </strong>According to Rough Draft Atlanta, “At issue are tax credits that lowered the cost of ACA plans that are set to expire Dec. 31. The credits were enacted as part of a Covid relief package in 2021. Unless Congress takes action to extend the credits, premiums for Georgians will, on average, more than double, a recent Georgia Health Initiative analysis found. [...] The exact amount of the rate increases will vary based on several factors, but on average, premiums in Georgia will more than double, from an average of $69 per month this year to $148 per month in 2026, according to the GHI report.” [Rough Draft Atlanta, <a href="https://roughdraftatlanta.com/2025/12/12/rising-aca-costs-georgia/"><u>12/12/25</u></a>]</p>

<p><strong>460,000 Georgians Planned To Drop Their ACA Health Insurance Over Increased Costs Without The Enhanced Premium Subsidies. </strong>According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “But the most recent estimate from the health research organization KFF is that about 460,000 Georgians will drop ACA health insurance. That’s a result of two things: new barriers passed in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, such as shortening the enrollment window, curtailing auto-enrollment, and adding paperwork and fees; and by far the biggest part of the projected loss, the expiration of the enhanced subsidies.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/2025/09/report-georgia-health-sector-to-lose-37b-in-2026-as-aca-subsidies-end/"><u>9/29/25</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Georgia’s Hospitals, Doctors, And Other Health Businesses Expected To Lose $3.7 Billion In Revenue After Georgians Forego Health Care Without The Enhanced Premium Subsidies. </strong>According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “Georgia’s hospitals, doctors and other health businesses stand to lose $3.7 billion in revenue next year alone, if Congress and President Donald Trump allow Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies to expire in December, a new forecast has found. [...] Without insurance, many of those people will skip doctor visits, medications, tests and other health care that they would otherwise have received. And other patients, especially in emergencies, will seek health care but not be able to pay for it.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/2025/09/report-georgia-health-sector-to-lose-37b-in-2026-as-aca-subsidies-end/"><u>9/29/25</u></a>]</p>

Yes, we do.” [John Fredericks Show, <a href="https://youtu.be/qNXtCQehMDE"><u>5/21/25</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>The Freedom Caucus Demanded At Least $880 Billion In Medicaid Cuts And Claimed It Was A Reversal In Medicaid’s “Explosive Expansion.”</strong> According to The Pennsylvania Independent, “He and House Republicans have since signed off on a budget plan that would eliminate up to $880 billion in funding for Medicaid, however, and three powerful Republican representatives are trying to frame those cuts as reforms needed to save the country. ‘In a March 10 Fox News op-ed, House Freedom Caucus chair Andy Harris (R-MD) and caucus members Eric Burlison (R-MO) and Chip Roy (R-TX) pressed their House GOP colleagues to endorse a series of so-called Medicaid reforms. “For lawmakers who claim to be on board with cutting the waste, fraud and abuse­ — and delivering on Trump’s historic mandate — this is it. Nothing you do in the next two years will come close to the importance of implementing the $880 billion required in savings to programs under the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s jurisdiction,” they wrote. “We are not asking you to slash Medicaid, only turn back the clock and reverse its explosive expansion in the last few years that has put it on an unsustainable course.’” [Pennsylvania Independent, <a href="https://pennsylvaniaindependent.com/health-care/house-republicans-medicaid-reform-ideas-would-lead-to-massive-funding-cuts-3/"><u>3/13/25</u></a>]</li>

<p><strong>[AUDIO] Carter Claimed The GOP’s Medicaid Cuts Would Come “Through Work Requirements” And Bemoaned “Able Bodied” People On Medicaid.</strong> “You do it through work requirements. Look, you shouldn't have an able bodied person who could be doing some type of work. It even includes volunteer work that is on that program. That's not who it was intended for, and that's not who we should be using it for. So there are all kind of things that we can do to find savings without kicking anyone off.” [Politically Georgia, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/a84dcfc7-4ba1-43f4-8605-e4ad67108f53/s-1NCeqSKaJy5?si=6bc0d662b9e548f8af5770fad0212728&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>5/12/25</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] Carter Declared That “First Of All, We Are Not Kicking Anyone Off Of Medicaid,” And Claimed The GOP Was Instead Going To “Make Sure That We Have Work Requirements In That Program.”</strong> “Well, first of all, we are not kicking anyone off of Medicaid. The Democrats are fear mongering. They're already running ads suggesting that. What we want to do is we want to say we want to stabilize, sustain. What I know from personal experience, having worked in this area, that is one of the most important programs in our government, and that is Medicaid for the most vulnerable in our society, the aged, the blind, disabled, for mothers, for children, all of that. And that's what it was intended for. Unfortunately, it’s evolved into something more than that. We didn't do the Medicaid expansion here in the state of Georgia, thank goodness. But we need to do, we need to make sure we save that program. And we can do that. We can cut out waste, fraud and abuse. We can make sure that we have work requirements in that program. There are things we can do.” [Politically Georgia, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/62d85baf-91be-477e-8dd1-7fba894e044a/s-OrpO4tPsSzn?si=f1856378fe8240db8232ad132873b7a1&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>5/12/25</u></a>]</p>

<h5><i>Carter Called The Work Requirements “Community Involvement”</i></h5>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Carter Claimed That One Of The Medicaid “Improvements” Was “Community Involvement”; He Bemoaned Democrats Who “Want To Call It Work Requirements. It’s Not Work Requirements. It’s Community Involvement.”</strong> “There are improvements that are going to support the family. And and certainly, you know, these are examples of how we can improve the family. But but there are other examples as well. We put we put a number of things in this bill. Again, you know what we're trying to do? We have community involvement. You know, the Democrats, they want to call it work requirements. It's not work requirements. It's community involvement. We want to help people step up and get off of Medicaid and get on to another insurance. And and that's important because if we've got an able-bodied adult that is just not doing anything except getting Medicaid, not working, not volunteering, not doing anything, that's that's not what Medicaid is for.” [Washington Watch with Tony Perkins, <a href="https://youtu.be/kUsFTNqSIDQ"><u>5/14/25</u></a>]</p>
