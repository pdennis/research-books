## No-Show Kean Wouldn't Stand Up For His Constituents As The Trump Administration’s Cuts Affected Services And Jobs

### Kean Described DOGE As A “Necessary Step”

**Kean Claimed DOGE And The Trump Administration’s Cuts Were A “Necessary Step.”** According to a tele-town hall hosted by Rep. Tom Kean, “QUESTION: Congressman, do you support the work that Elon Musk and DOGE are doing to cut federal government agencies across the board and layoff thousands of federal employees? KEAN: I do support federal government spending that reflects the needs and the priorities of the American people. It is well past due that the federal government has a 21st century accounting system and puts a premium on both transparency and accountability. Past administrations, both Republicans and Democrats have advocated and done this with great success. Right now, we are paying $2.5 billion in interest payments on our national debt on a daily basis. I do not support turning a blind eye to any waste, fraud and abuse whatsoever. We need to make sure we also are protecting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security for their intended beneficiaries, which we all know that we've seen numerous examples of inappropriate spending at home and abroad. This is a necessary step. Thank you." \[Rep. Tom Kean Jr. Tele Town Hall, [3/26/25](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/tom-kean-jr-tele-town-hall-3262025/s-9J9ZUVNS93v?si=6cbe7cb10075463b840a752919eac639&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)\] (audio)
