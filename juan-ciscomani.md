# How To Win against Juan Ciscomani

Ciscomani pretended to be an independent voice for Arizona, but he was just another far-right Republican who fell in line with whatever Trump told him to do. He repeatedly promised his would protect Arizonans’ health care benefits and services and tax credits that created clean energy manufacturing jobs in his district, then he voted to cut them all. He defended Trump’s tariffs despite knowing they would and were hurting Arizona families, small businesses, and farmers. He can’t be trusted as an independent voice for southern Arizona, after all he was trained to push the far-right, price-skyrocketing agenda.  

### Ciscomani’s votes threatened thousands of arizonans’ access to affordable health care

-   Ciscomani [repeatedly](https://tucson.com/news/local/government-politics/us-rep-juan-ciscomani-tucson-republican-budget-cuts-fund-border-security-protect-medicai-snap-pell-grants/article_6356b6d2-f08a-11ef-b79b-e7e8ad1308e8.html) [promised](https://soundcloud.com/horton-mcdaniel/juan-ciscomani-the-conservative-circus-5125/s-J1hBDgZXbYX?si=1869aca81c1d460c841e6059c3a9d3aa&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) that he would protect Medicaid and rural health care for Arizonans. Then he [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that is estimated to kick [17 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health coverage, including [nearly 12 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) who rely on Medicaid. Ciscomani even later admitted that if congress put caps on the provider tax rate Arizona “rural hospitals would suffer,” but he voted for the bill anyway. [Nearly 32,000 Arizonans](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) in the 6^th^ congressional district could lose their health coverage as a result of Ciscomani’s votes. 

**Message:** Ciscomani voted to rip health coverage from thousands of Arizonans to pay for billionaire tax breaks. 

### Ciscomani broke his promise and voted for massive medicare cuts

-   While running for Congress in 2024, Ciscomani [promised](https://x.com/JuanCiscomani/status/1820851711784968243) that he would protect Medicare. Then, he [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml) for a bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would trigger [nearly $500 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare, absent future congressional action. 

**Message:** Ciscomani voted to cut health care services seniors rely on, all to fund billionaire tax breaks. 

### ciscomani defended trump’s tariffs that were crushing arizonans

-   Ciscomani voted four times to protect Trump’s tariffs, including in April when he was the [deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect the tariffs from being repealed by Congress, dooming Arizonans who relied on him to a trade war and rising prices. Tariffs were contributing to [higher food prices](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi), hurting [Tucson businesses](https://www.kold.com/2025/04/10/tucson-area-business-reacts-90-day-pause-tariffs/), and were [devastating to farmers](https://www.abc15.com/news/state/it-could-break-us-valley-farmer-says-chinese-tariffs-have-crushed-the-alfalfa-export-market). 
-   Ciscomani defended the tariffs, claiming people needed to [trust Trump with economic decisions](https://www.gvnews.com/free_access/q-a-ciscomani-looks-at-trumps-first-four-weeks/article_9150683a-f008-11ef-bb2f-abdfeb76f9dd.html), but later admitted that tariffs in the long-term would be [“very detrimental to Arizona.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SMn7PWtz_k)

**Message:** Ciscomani was the deciding vote to protect tariffs that were raising prices on Arizona families. 

### Ciscomani defended doge as it attacked social security and federal workers who served arizona veterans and farmers

-   Ciscomani stood by while Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” made cuts and reductions that affected the federal government’s ability to deliver services to seniors. [More than 232,000 Arizonans](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/az.pdf) in Ciscomani’s district relied on Social Security benefits. Ciscomani was even [“thrilled”](https://ciscomani.house.gov/media/press-releases/ciscomani-joins-doge-caucus-rein-wasteful-spending-and-make-government-more) to join the congressional DOGE caucus and claimed people needed to [trust Trump and his decisions](https://www.gvnews.com/free_access/q-a-ciscomani-looks-at-trumps-first-four-weeks/article_9150683a-f008-11ef-bb2f-abdfeb76f9dd.html). 

**Message:** While Social Security lines grew and Arizona workers were laid off, Ciscomani didn’t help them.

### Ciscomani’s votes threatened clean energy jobs in his district

-   Ciscomani [repeatedly](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4815990-mike-johnson-ira-clean-energy-tax-credits/) [promised](https://garbarino.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/garbarino.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025.03.09-tax-credits-letter.pdf) to protect clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act and even admitted repealing them would have [“detrimental effects”](https://www.energysage.com/news/house-republicans-support-clean-energy-tax-breaks/) on his constituents. Then he [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for Republicans’ reconciliation bill, which gutted some credits and repealed others. After voting in May 2025 for House Republicans’ version of the bill, he [signed a letter](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/13-house-republicans-urge-senate-scale-back-clean-energy-cuts-bill-vot-rcna211516) in June asking the senate to scale back the same cuts to Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax credits that he voted for. Then he claimed the credits were not [“a reason strong enough”](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/06/12/arizona-gop-congressmen-concerned-about-big-beautiful-bill/84155534007/) to oppose the bill and voted for the final version. 
-   [Major clean energy projects](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/16/clean-energy-arizona-ciscomani-ira-00342972) in Ciscomani’s district have relied on Inflation Reduction Act tax credits including an electric vehicle plant expansion that provided jobs that were described as [“life-changing”](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/16/clean-energy-arizona-ciscomani-ira-00342972) for many in the community. 

**Message:** Ciscomani said Arizonans’ jobs were not “a reason strong enough” to vote against cuts to tax credits that supported them, instead he prioritized tax cuts for billionaires. 

### it took ciscomani 11 months to vote to release the epstein files and he did only have trump gave republicans permission

In November 2025, after 11 months, Ciscomani finally [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml) to release the Epstein files, but only after [Donald Trump gave House Republicans permission](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115562626931599548) to do so. Previously, Ciscomani had [cast the deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml) against [releasing the Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj), protecting the accused pedophiles named within. Ciscomani claimed he full supported the federal government being transparent and releasing the Epstein files, but he [never signed](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209) the discharge petition that called for the files’ release and he never [co-sponsored](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581/cosponsors?pageSort=alphaByParty) Rep. Thomas Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna’s resolution that called for their release.

**Message:** It took Ciscomani 11 months to vote to release the Epstein files and he did only after Trump signaled it was okay.
