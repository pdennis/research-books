## Overview

Gabe Evans was an anti-choice extremist who is out-of-touch with Coloradans:

-   Evans described himself as 100 percent pro-life and in 2022 he received a 100 percent rating from Colorado for Life. 
-   In 2022, Evans responded to two far-right voter guides expressing anti-abortion views. In the Freedom Voter Guide, which is distributed by the designated hate group Alliance Defending Freedom, Evans said he opposed abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. In a different voter guide, when asked under what circumstances abortion should be allowed, Evans responded, “Life begins at conception. If the circumstances wouldn't warrant killing a born person, the unborn also should not be killed."
-   Evans supported the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. When asked if he would support a national abortion ban, he claimed he wouldn’t, but has twice said he saw no reason to “reverse course on the success that the pro-life movement is having.”
-   Evans opposed Colorado’s law which enshrined the right to have an abortion or continue a pregnancy, as well as the right to use or refuse contraceptives. Evans also voted against a bill that sought to protect people who traveled to Colorado from other states in order to obtain an abortion. 
-   Asked how he voted on a 2020 ballot initiative that sought to ban abortion in Colorado after 22-weeks, Evans claimed he couldn’t remember. He claimed this despite remembering the exact name of the campaign that pushed the ballot initiative, “Due Date Too Late,” and that he and his wife had deep discussions about the issue because they were split on it. Coloradans rejected the initiative with 59 percent voting against it.

**2024: Evans Said He Was 100 Percent Pro-Life.** According to the Colorado Times Recorder, “‘We have to have the wisdom to come up with policies that best preserve life,’ said Evans, saying he is 100% pro-life. ‘And I think that the Supreme Court rightly decided this case that it is now up to the legislatures and to the voters of Colorado to figure out how they are going to best protect life.’ ‘We need to stand for life. We need to stand for our most vulnerable. That’s the babies. But that’s also the women in these terrible life situations that I worked with for 10 years as a police officer. So I think this is up to the state legislatures, and I will always stand for life,’ said Evans, who’s made similar comments previously on the campaign trail.” \[Colorado Times Recorder, [1/26/24](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2024/01/gop-candidates-in-co-swing-district-support-trump-and-question-obamacare/59281/)\]

-   **Evans Said He Would “Always Stand For Life” And That Abortion Policy Should Be Left To State Legislatures.** According to the Colorado Times Recorder, “‘We need to stand for life. We need to stand for our most vulnerable. That’s the babies. But that’s also the women in these terrible life situations that I worked with for 10 years as a police officer. So I think this is up to the state legislatures, and I will always stand for life,’ said Evans, who’s made similar comments previously on the campaign trail.” \[Colorado Times Recorder, [1/26/24](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2024/01/gop-candidates-in-co-swing-district-support-trump-and-question-obamacare/59281/)\]

### 2022: In A Freedom Voter Guide, Evans Said He Opposed Abortion, Even In Cases Of Rape Or Incest

**In A 2022 Freedom Voter Guide Survey, Evans Indicated That He Opposed Abortion Including In Cases Of Rape Or Incest.** According to the Colorado Times Recorder, “Evans’s support for the overturn of Roe v. Wade comports with an anti-choice stance he took in a Freedom Voter Guide survey. There, he indicated he opposed abortion, even for women who were raped by a family member and supported abortion only to save the life of the mother.” \[Colorado Times Recorder, [9/20/23](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2023/09/congressional-candidate-gabe-evans-says-he-supports-the-overturn-of-roe/56355/)\]

-   **The Freedom Voter Guide Was Put Out By The Alliance Defending Freedom.** According to the Freedom Voter Guide, the questionnaire was created by the Alliance Defending Freedom. \[Freedom Voter Guide, Viewed [7/30/24](https://freedomvoterguide.com/)\]   
     
-   **The Southern Poverty Law Center Designated The Alliance Defending Freedom As A Hate Group For Its Anti-LGBTQ+ Work.** According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, "Founded by some 30 leaders of the Christian Right, the Alliance Defending Freedom is a legal advocacy and training group that has supported the recriminalization of sexual acts between consenting LGBTQ adults in the U.S. and criminalization abroad; has defended state-sanctioned sterilization of trans people abroad; has contended that LGBTQ people are more likely to engage in pedophilia; and claims that a ‘homosexual agenda’ will destroy Christianity and society. ADF also works to develop ‘religious liberty’ legislation and case law that will allow the denial of goods and services to LGBTQ people on the basis of religion. Since the election of President Trump, ADF has become one of the most influential groups informing the administration’s attack on LGBTQ rights." \[Southern Poverty Law Center, Viewed [7/30/24](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/alliance-defending-freedom)\] 
-   **2002-2010: Speaker Mike Johnson Worked For The Alliance Defending Freedom.** According to Rolling Stone, "Johnson comes with quite a resume. He defended Donald Trump at both of his impeachment hearings, helped plot the Jan. 6 attempted coup, and holds hardline positions on everything from abortion to LGBTQ rights. He worked for the ADF from 2002 until 2010, penning op-eds against marriage equality and endorsing briefs filed by the ADF meant to criminalize sexual activity between consenting adults. He now controls the business of the House of Representatives, including which members chair congressional committees and which bills receive floor votes. He’s also second in line for the presidency." \[Rolling Stone, [10/29/23](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/mike-johnson-alliance-defending-freedom-anti-lgbtq-1234865340/)\]

### Evans Touted His Support for Overturning Roe v. Wade and Said Abortion Decisions Should Be Handled by The States

**HEADLINE: “Congressional Candidate Gabe Evans Says He Supports The Overturn Of Roe”** \[Colorado Times Recorder, [9/20/23](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2023/09/congressional-candidate-gabe-evans-says-he-supports-the-overturn-of-roe/56355/)\]

**9/11/23: Evans Supported Overturning Roe V. Wade And Said He Saw No Reason To “Reverse Course On The Success That The Pro-Life Movement Is Having.”** According to Colorado Times Recorder, “Evens didn’t commit to backing a national abortion ban, saying instead, ‘You know, so the pro-life movement has been working for the last 50 years to try to have this issue, you know, overturned and returned to the states. We’ve seen a lot of success there. And I don’t really see any reason to reverse course on the success that the pro-life movement is having.’” \[Colorado Times Recorder, [9/20/23](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2023/09/congressional-candidate-gabe-evans-says-he-supports-the-overturn-of-roe/56355/)\]

**January 2024: Evans Said The Supreme Court Was Right In Sending Abortion Policy Back To The States.** According to Colorado Times Recorder, “Colorado Rep. Gabe Evans (R-Ft. Lupton) opposes a federal abortion ban. ‘We have to have the wisdom to come up with policies that best preserve life,’ said Evans during a January candidate forum. ‘And I think that the Supreme Court rightly decided this case that it is now up to the legislatures and to the voters of Colorado to figure out how they are going to best protect life. We need to stand for life. We need to stand for our most vulnerable. That’s the babies.” \[Colorado Times Recorder, [2/7/24](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2024/02/republican-congressional-candidates-on-abortion/59648/)\]

**7/11/24: Asked Where He Stood On A National Abortion Ban, Evans Pointed Out The Supreme Court Overturning Roe V. Wade And Said He Didn’t See “Any Reason To Reverse Half A Century Worth Of Work By The Pro-Life Movement.”** According to an interview Gabe Evans gave to Sherrie Peif, "PEIF: Which kind of leads to, you know, one of the big questions that I know you're asked that pretty much every forum and it's a big topic of conversation is if there were to be a bill that came before you that would ban abortion in all 50 states and make it a federal crime, where do you stand on a national abortion ban? EVANS: Yeah, So I think that again, I'm pro-life. The pro-life movement has been working for a half a century to get Roe overturned, and that happened a couple of years ago. And I think the Supreme Court was pretty clear when they sent that back to the states. They said this is an issue for the states to be able to address. And so I don't see any reason to reverse half a century worth of work by the pro-life movement. And so and even, you know, even President Trump does not support a national abortion ban. So I don't think that this is a national issue. I think the Supreme Court was very, very clear in sending this to the states. And so it's up to the states now to figure out how do they best preserve all life born and unborn." \[YouTube, Sherrie Peif, [7/11/24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uh_B3HgdoQ)\] (video)

### Evans Opposed Colorado’s Law, Which Protected Reproductive Freedom

**Evans Said He Opposed Colorado’s Reproductive Health Equity Act Because He Was “About As Pro-Life As They Come.”** According to the Colorado Times Recorder, "In 2022, while running for his Colorado House seat, Evans made his position clear. ‘I am running for the house legislature because I want to go into the state capital and weigh in on policies being made in the state,’ Evans told former KNUS host Steffan Tubbs. ‘Unfortunately one of the policies that was passed by the legislature and signed by the governor is the most pro-abortion law in the entire nation HB22-1279 and it basically establishes abortion in the state of Colorado as a fundamental right and I find that ridiculous, not only because I am about as pro-life as they come, but because polling shows that over 70% of Americans, to include Democrats and folks that identify as pro-choice, think that there should be restrictions on abortion. Our out-of-touch leftist legislature here in CO, they just keep pushing further left and passing these radical policies that are just out of touch with the population.’" \[Colorado Times Recorder, [8/30/24](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2024/08/as-trump-flip-flops-co-congressional-candidate-evans-anti-choice-record-includes-calling-a-fundamental-right-to-abortion-ridiculous/63973/)\]

-   **Evans On The Reproductive Health Equity Act: “It Basically Establishes Abortion In The State Of Colorado As A Fundamental Right, And I Find That Ridiculous.”** According to an interview with Gabe Evans on the Steffan Tubbs Show, “EVANS: Unfortunately, this year, one of the policies that was passed by our legislature and signed by our governor was one of actually it is it's the most pro-abortion law in the entire nation, House Bill 22-1279. And it basically establishes abortion in the state of Colorado as a fundamental right. And I find that ridiculous, not only because I'm about as pro-life as they come.” \[Steffan Tubbs Show, [5/3/22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97UITRcCi3o)\] (video) 
-   **The Reproductive Health Equity Act, Which Was Signed Into Law, Ensured Every Person The Right To Give Birth Or To Have An Abortion Without Consequences.** According to the Colorado General Assembly bill summary of HB22-1279, "The act declares that every individual has a fundamental right to use or refuse contraception; every pregnant individual has a fundamental right to continue the pregnancy and give birth or to have an abortion; and a fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus does not have independent or derivative rights under the laws of the state. The act prohibits state and local public entities from:   Denying, restricting, interfering with, or discriminating against an individual's fundamental right to use or refuse contraception or to continue a pregnancy and give birth or to have an abortion in the regulation or provision of benefits, services, information, or facilities; and Depriving, through prosecution, punishment, or other means, an individual of the individual's right to act or refrain from acting during the individual's own pregnancy based on the potential, actual, or perceived impact on the pregnancy, the pregnancy's outcomes, or on the pregnant individual's health." \[Colorado General Assembly, HB22-1279, Viewed [2/25/25](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb22-1279?fbclid=IwY2xjawIq9uRleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHTbF4QYkQv9V8-SO6UHpsp7FAusCIBYzfrlNbBj8KM-nWu1z9V6XKHVP7g_aem_lv7yQAHu5HBQywtIdiSxPg)\]
-   **Colorado Governor Jared Polis: “This Bill Will Also Prevent Any Person From Being Forced To End Or Continue A Pregnancy, And Ensure That No One Is Forced To Perform Or Have An Abortion Against Their Will Or Conscience.”** According to the Denver Post, "‘This important bill simply codifies existing protections in statute,’ Polis wrote. ‘The bill does not make any changes to the current legal framework for parental notification that exists in state law. This bill will also prevent any person from being forced to end or continue a pregnancy, and ensure that no one is forced to perform or have an abortion against their will or conscience. Such is already the case in Colorado today. This bill simply maintains this status quo regardless of what happens at the federal level and preserves all existing constitutional rights and obligations.’" \[Denver Post, [4/4/22](https://www.denverpost.com/2022/04/04/colorado-abortion-rights-state-law/?clearUserState=true)\]

### Evans Voted Against a Bill that Sought to Protect People Who Traveled to Colorado to Obtain an Abortion

**4/1/23: Evans Voted Against SB23-188.** According to the Colorado General Assembly, on April 1, 2023, Gabe Evans voted “no” on SB23-188. \[Colorado General Assembly, SB23-188, House Vote, [4/1/23](https://leg.colorado.gov/content/sb23-188vote7d764e)\] 

-   **SB23-188 Sought To Protect People Who Traveled To Colorado To Obtain An Abortion From Lawsuits And Criminal Prosecution In Other States.** According to Colorado Newsline, "Senate Bill 23-188 is a shield law to protect people who travel to Colorado for abortion or gender-affirming care from lawsuits and criminal prosecution initiated in other states. It also protects providers and people who assist patients from that prosecution. Some conservative states, such as Texas, not only severely restrict abortion but also have so-called ‘bounty laws’ in effect to go after people who seek care in states where it is legal." \[Colorado Newsline, [4/14/23](https://coloradonewsline.com/2023/04/14/colorado-polis-abortion-related-protections/)\]

So there is a lot of just like that, you know — like I know enough but there is a lot of nuances to that female reproductive care stuff that my wife is sitting there trying to explain to me about how this stuff all works together, and there are a lot of doctors that she goes to that I don’t go to because I don’t got the right parts. INTERVIEWER: Right. EVANS: And so she’s trying to explain to me what happens at these doctors visits, and I’m like at a certain point, I’m going to have to take your word for it because to me, that’s what’s most important is that we figure out, how do we best protect life. And life, there’s a lot of complexities to it, particularly when you get down to the realm of eight miscarriages and figuring out, okay, how do I protect life in this particular situation? How do I protect life in that particular situation?” \[Colorado Times Recorder, [7/18/24](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2024/07/anti-abortion-candidate-says-he-doesnt-understand-the-nuances-to-that-female-reproductive-care-stuff-because-i-dont-got-the-right-parts/63192/); Sherrie Peif Interview, [7/11/24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmtKnXoZuFA)\] (video)

**Asked If He Supported An Anti-Abortion Ballot Initiative In Colorado, Evans Correctly Named The Campaign, The “Due Date Too Late Campaign,” That Pushed The Initiative.** According to an interview Gabe Evans gave to Sherrie Peif, "SHERRIE PEIF: Going to move on to some policy stuff. Since I don't know how long people can stay on, I do actually have a question from one of the viewers, E.J. And so I'm going to ask, because I think it's an appropriate question that I probably know the answer to. But he said, Gabe, I was wondering if you supported the ballot initiative a few years ago that would have ended late term abortion in Colorado? GABE EVANS: I think that was the, what was that? The due date too late 2022?  PEIF: I think that's the one yeah, that sounds right.  EVANS: I am trying to remember how I voted on that one because my wife and I had some major discussions over that, that particular one." \[YouTube, Sherrie Peif, [7/11/24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIBQW_OWMEw)\] (video)

### 2022: Colorado for Life Effectively Endorsed Evans

**2022: Colorado For Life Gave Evans A 100 Percent Rating.** According to Colorado for Life, "Each election cycle, we evaluate candidates based on their pro-life action in public office or in their community, answers to survey questions, and leadership they’ve shown on the pro-life issue. We only offer a 100% rating and do not provide lifetime endorsements. Rather, we watch to see where candidates really stand and how they lead. The lives of our unborn are too precious to provide ratings to candidates who campaign on the pro-life issue but do not lead on it once in office. Our rating of candidates does not mean other candidates are not pro-life, just that we believe these candidates will best lead on the issue. Colorado State House Districts: HD 10 - William DeOreo HD 15 - Scott Bottoms HD 22 - Ken DeGraaf HD 26 - Savannah Wolfson HD 30 - Russ Carter HD 41 - Stephanie Hancock HD 47 - Ty Winter HD 48 - Gabe Evans" \[Colorado for Life, Candidate Ratings, [11/4/22](https://web.archive.org/web/20221104220708/https:/www.coloradoforlife.org/candidate-ratings) via archive.org\]

The bad news is that radical pro-abortionists from Denver and Boulder are in firm control of our Colorado government, even though more and more leaders and citizens are wising up to their deadly agenda." \[Colorado for Life, About, Viewed [7/30/24](https://www.coloradoforlife.org/about)\]
