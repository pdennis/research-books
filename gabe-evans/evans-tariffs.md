## Overview

Evans has voted four times to protect Trump’s tariffs, including in April when he was the [deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect the tariffs from being repealed by Congress, dooming Coloradans who relied on him to a trade war and rising prices. Tariffs are contributing to [higher food prices](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi) and are hurting Colorado [small businesses](https://www.usnews.com/news/u-s-news-decision-points/articles/2025-08-21/how-tariffs-are-affecting-this-colorado-small-business-owner) and [construction companies](https://www.vaildaily.com/news/trump-tariffs-colorado-construction-materials/), which could [worsen housing affordability](https://coloradonewsline.com/2025/09/04/colorado-tariff-rate-rises-sevenfold/). 

Despite this, Evans has claimed that Trump’s tariffs will  [“bring down the price of goods for all Americans.”](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/rep-gabe-evans-tele-town-hall-4225/s-sFjpYJiwhqL?si=2d004209e0174e428e23c07d419db518&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing/)

## Evans Was The Deciding Vote To Protect Trump’s Tariffs Despite The Harm They Could Cause To Colorado’s Economy

### Evans Repeatedly Vote to Protect Trump’s Tariffs

#### September 2025: Evans Voted To Protect Trump’s Tariffs

**2025: Evans Effectively Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through March 2026.** In September 2025, Evans voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the resolution \[that\] would allow for the tolling (the pausing of counting) of days for resolutions of inquiry from Sept. 30, 2025 through March 31, 2026. It also would provide that each day during the period from April 9, 2025, through March 31, 2026. would not constitute a calendar day for the purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution to terminate President Donald Trump's April 2, 2025 executive order declaring a national emergency regarding tariffs on imported goods. The resolution also would provide that during the period for March 11, 2025 through March 31, 2026, would not constitute a calendar day for purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution terminating a national emergency executive order declared by President Trump on Feb. 1, 2025. Such an executive order concerned tariffs on many Canadian and Mexican imports and Chinese goods. The resolution also would provide that the provisions of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act would not apply through March 31, 2026 to a joint resolution terminating the national emergency.” The vote was on the rule. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 213 to 211. \[House Vote 268, [9/16/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll268.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/16/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/268?4); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 707](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/707/all-actions);Congressional Actions, [H.Con. Res. 14](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/14/all-actions)\]

-   **Support Was Won From GOP Holdouts Through A Promise Of A Vote Later In The Week To Shorten The Block To End In January Rather Than March.** According to Politico, “GOP leaders flipped several of the Republican holdouts with a promise to add language shortening the block on tariff disapproval votes to a forthcoming measure set for approval later in the week, per two Republicans with direct knowledge of the agreement. The expiration date on the block will be reset from March 31 to the end of January, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Tuesday. It’s likely the Supreme Court will have ruled on a challenge to Trump’s tariff-declaring powers by then.” \[Politico, [9/16/25](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/16/congress/house-again-votes-to-surrender-tariff-powers-to-trump-00566975)\]

#### April 2025: Evans Cast The Deciding Vote To Protect Trump’s Tariffs

**2025: Evans Cast The Deciding Vote For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through September 2025.** In April 2025, Evans voted for, “adoption of the rule (H Res 313) that would provide for floor consideration of the Senate amendment to the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). The rule would provide up to one hour of debate on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the measure. It also would block the expedited consideration of joint resolutions terminating President Donald Trump’s tariff actions under the April 2 executive order by providing that each day during the period from April 9, 2025 through Sept. 30, 2025, will not constitute a calendar day under the federal law pertaining to terminating national emergencies.” The vote was on the rule. The underlying legislation was the FY 2025 budget resolution. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 216 to 215. \[House Vote 94, [4/9/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/9/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/94?4); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 313](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/313/all-actions);Congressional Actions, [H.Con. Res. 14](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/14/all-actions)\]

-   **Speaker Johnson Backed The Move, Claiming Trump Has “Executive Authority” And That The Tariffs Are “In The Interest Of The American People.”** According to ABC News, “House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., defended the move, telling reporters, ‘I've made it very clear I think the president has executive authority. It's an appropriate level of authority to deal with the unfair trade practices. That's part of the role of the president is to negotiate with other countries.’ Johnson said Trump told him Tuesday night that ‘there are almost 70 countries that are \[in\] some stage in negotiation of more fair-trade agreement agreements with the United States. I think that is in the interest of the American people. I think that is an ‘America First’ policy that will be effective, and so we have to give them the space to do it.’” \[ABC News, [4/9/25](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-gop-moves-prevent-votes-rescinding-trump-tariffs/story?id=120644968)\]
-   **The Vote Was The Second Use Of The Procedural Tactic To Block Votes On The Tariffs, The First Use Of It Being In March.** According to ABC News, “House Democrats, led by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., moved to force a vote on Tuesday on terminating the national emergency authority and blocking Trump's sweeping tariffs. Now, that vote is unlikely to occur. This is the second time Johnson has moved to stop the legislative calendar to prevent votes on Trump's authority on tariffs. Under House rules, these votes would typically come up within 15 calendar days but now will not if the ‘rule’ passes during the vote series Wednesday afternoon.” \[ABC News, [4/9/25](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-gop-moves-prevent-votes-rescinding-trump-tariffs/story?id=120644968)\]

##### If One “Aye” Vote Had Switched To A “No” On House Vote 94 The Measure Would Have Failed Instead Of Passing

**The Measure Considered In House Vote 94 Passed By A Vote Of 216 “Ayes” To 215 “Nos,” Which Meant If One Aye Vote Had Switched To A No Vote The Measure Would Have Failed.**

Res. 14](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/14/all-actions)\]

#### April 2025: Evans Voted To Protect Trump’s Tariffs

**2025: Evans Effectively Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through September 2025.** In April 2025, Evans voted for, “motion to order the previous question (thus ending debate and possibility of amendment) on the rule (H Res 313) that would providing for floor consideration of the Senate amendment to the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). The rule would provide up to one hour of debate on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the measure. It also would block the expedited consideration of joint resolutions terminating President Donald Trump’s tariff actions under the April 2 executive order by providing that each day during the period from April 9, 2025 through Sept. 30, 2025, will not constitute a calendar day under the federal law pertaining to terminating national emergencies.” The vote was on the previous question. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 217 to 212. \[House Vote 93, [4/9/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll093.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/9/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/93?4); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 313](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/313/all-actions)\]

#### March 2025: Evans Voted To Protect Trump’s Tariffs

**2025: Evans Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs.** In March 2025, Evans voted for, “the bill that would provide for Congressional disapproval of, and nullify, a December 2024 IRS rule related to gross proceeds reporting by brokers involved in digital asset sales. The rule imposed reporting requirements, beginning in 2027, on non-custodial barkers who participate in the decentralized digital asset market. It also required brokers to file information returns and provide payee statements reporting gross proceeds from certain digital asset sales and transactions.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 292 to 132. \[House Vote 71, [3/11/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll071.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/11/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/71?4); Congressional Actions, [H.J. Res. 25](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-joint-resolution/25/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Effectively Blocked The House From Voting To Reverse Trump’s Tariffs On Mexico, Canada, And China For The Next Year.** According to the New York Times, “Republican leaders on Tuesday slipped language into a procedural measure that would prevent any resolution to end the tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China from receiving a vote this year. It passed on party lines as part of a resolution that cleared the way for a vote later Tuesday on a government spending bill needed to prevent a shutdown at the end of the week.” \[New York Times, [3/11/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]
-   **The Bill Nullified A Law That Would Allow The House And Senate To End A Disaster Declared By The President.** According to the New York Times, “In this case, Republican leaders did so using a particularly unusual contortion: They essentially declared the rest of the year one long day, nullifying a law that allows the House and Senate to jointly put an end to a disaster declared by the president.” \[New York Times, [3/11/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]
-   **The National Emergencies Act Required Consideration Of Resolutions Ending A Presidentially Declared Emergency Within Fifteen Calendar Days But Republican Leadership Included A Measure In The Bill Declaring The Rest Of The Year Did Not Constitute A Calendar Day.** According to the New York Times, “The national emergency law lays out a fast-track process for Congress to consider a resolution ending a presidential emergency, requiring committee consideration within 15 calendar days after one is introduced and a floor vote within three days after that. But the language House Republicans inserted in their measure on Tuesday declared that, ‘Each day for the remainder of the 119th Congress shall not constitute a calendar day’ for the purposes of the emergency that Mr. Trump declared on Feb. 1.” \[New York Times, [3/11/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]

### Evans Claimed Trump’s Tariffs Would “Ultimately Bring Down the Price of Goods for All Americans”

**Evans On Trump Tariffs: "I Am Absolutely Confident That By Getting Back To Free And Fair Trade Practices… That Will Ultimately Bring Down The Price Of Goods For All Americans.”** According to Colorado Public Radio, “At a town hall hours after the tariffs were announced, Rep. Gabe Evans said he supports free trade, but still defended the sweeping move. He focused on the idea that these are ‘reciprocal tariffs, which means that if they have a tariff on us, then we have a tariff back on them.’  But not all the tariffs Trump announced are reciprocal, including some that will be levied on a couple of uninhabited islands near Antarctica. And those that are reciprocal weren’t calculated to directly match the country’s tariffs on U.S. goods. Instead, the administration’s formula takes the country’s trade deficit with the U.S., divided by its exports and then halves that amount. Existing tariff rates were not used in the calculation at all.  ‘It seems like everything’s in flux,’ Evans said at his town hall, ‘but at the end of the day, I am absolutely confident that by getting back to free and fair trade practices… that will ultimately bring down the price of goods for all Americans.’" \[Colorado Public Radio, [4/3/25](https://www.cpr.org/2025/04/03/what-colorado-lawmakers-think-of-trumps-tariffs/)\]

**April 2025: Evans Claimed Trump’s Tariff Tactics Would “Ultimately Bring Down The Price Of Goods For All Americans.”** According to a tele-town hall hosted by Rep. Gabe Evans, “EVANS: We can get back to a free trade basis in which via reciprocal tariffs, if other countries lower their tariffs because they want access to our markets, we lower ours as well. And that will ultimately bring down the price of goods for all Americans, which of course is critically important to so many of us who see how much prices have gone up around the country and specifically in Colorado.” \[Rep. Gabe Evans Tele-Town Hall, [4/2/25](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/rep-gabe-evans-tele-town-hall-4225/s-sFjpYJiwhqL?si=2d004209e0174e428e23c07d419db518&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)\] (audio) 

**January 2025: Asked About The Impact That Tariffs Would Have On Prices, Evans Claimed He “Couldn’t Give You That Conjecture At This Point.”** According to an interview Rep. Gabe Evans gave on Denver 7, “ANCHOR: Congressman Evans sits on the Energy and Commerce Committee. So while I had his attention there, I asked him about the steep tariffs the U.S. will levy against Mexico, Canada, and China starting tomorrow. Are you at all concerned this the tariffs are going to raise the price of goods for American consumers and the effect will be slowing the economy here? EVANS: I think that when again, whenever we talk tariffs, we have to be very specific about which tariffs, where, what products. And so a general statement about the impact that they're going to have on the economy, I really couldn't give you that conjecture at this point.” \[Denver 7, [1/31/25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjGDnki3-k0)\] (video) 

### Trump’s Tariffs Were Hurting Small Businesses and Construction in Colorado

**Colorado Small Business Owner: “Ultimately, Tariffs Hurt Our Ability To Compete, Which Is The Very Thing They Are Supposed To Help With."** According to U.S. News & World Report, "Many small businesses have also been forced to make difficult decisions, like raising prices and cutting their staff. One of them is Shaun Beall’s furniture company, Tactile Audio Furniture. Based in Colorado since its founding in 2019, Beall’s company specializes in custom furniture for music lovers and audiophiles. \[…\] ‘Made in America’ rarely means that something is 100% sourced and manufactured here. The reality is that we live in a global supply chain, and some things that are essential just aren't available domestically at any price. Also, functionally tariffs are paid by U.S. companies importing goods. We as the importer write the check to the U.S. government. It's a tax on us plain and simple. Tariffs are not being paid by foreign governments or suppliers. Tariffs create a negative economic ripple effect for our local supply partners, our workers and our customers. Ultimately, tariffs hurt our ability to compete, which is the very thing they are supposed to help with." \[U.S. News & World Report, [8/21/25](https://www.usnews.com/news/u-s-news-decision-points/articles/2025-08-21/how-tariffs-are-affecting-this-colorado-small-business-owner)\]

**Colorado Small Business Owner Said Tariffs Were Creating A “Drag” On Their Business Operations, Which Made Them Less Competitive And Hurt Their Ability To Confidently Invest In Growth.** According to U.S. News & World Report, "Was there a notable shift in operations before versus after the tariffs began? While we do our best to source materials, tools and supplies locally and sustainably, the reality is that some essential items just aren't available domestically at any price. We have seen tariffs create dramatic fluctuations in some material costs and availability. The constantly changing tariff policies have created an environment of uncertainty as well. Overall that has created a drag on our business operations, which makes us less competitive and hurts our ability to confidently invest in growth." \[U.S. News & World Report, [8/21/25](https://www.usnews.com/news/u-s-news-decision-points/articles/2025-08-21/how-tariffs-are-affecting-this-colorado-small-business-owner)\]

**Colorado Small Business Owner Said The Increased Cost And Decreased Availability Of Some Materials Had Caused Them To Pull Back On Staffing.** According to U.S. News & World Report, "When did tariffs start making an impact, and what have they affected most? We first started seeing the effect of tariffs in April. For us, the increased cost and decreased availability of some critical materials has been the most challenging part. This has caused us to pull back a little on staffing while we see where things will land.  We have also spent more on building inventory of raw materials to help offset pricing and availability risk. This is capital that could have been better used for investing in our growth. These are funds generally directed at other local small businesses and contractors that we partner with, so there is a ripple effect happening." \[U.S. News & World Report, [8/21/25](https://www.usnews.com/news/u-s-news-decision-points/articles/2025-08-21/how-tariffs-are-affecting-this-colorado-small-business-owner)\]

**Colorado Construction Company Said Trump’s Tariffs On Canada And Asian Countries Would Have A Major Impact On Them.** According to the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel, "Trump tariffs on Canada and Asian nations would have a particularly major impact on Shaw’s finances. ‘Almost everything we touch, to some degree, has an international component on it. From cabinets to the millwork that’s included in the cabinets, a lot of that can be from South Korea, it can be from China. That’s one example of one industry affected by tariffs,’ Meyer said. ‘The wood framing industry, a big aspect of that comes from Canada with the Doug fir. There’s a lot of reports in the news about using wood domestically and they always reference southern pine out of the southeast, but in the Rocky Mountain region, the western U.S., we don’t use that wood because it warps and it doesn’t have the same structural integrity as Doug fir. We’re looking at Doug fir from Canada. There’s pockets of Oregon and Wyoming and Montana, but our fear is that when you start playing this tariff game, that goes on and those other domestic mills will sense the blood in the water and maybe start to increase their pricing, as well.’" \[Grand Junction Daily Sentinel, [4/30/25](https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/business/how-do-tariffs-impact-construction-in-western-colorado/article_df7db143-1d23-451f-a79a-ef4b60ee90cc.html)\]
