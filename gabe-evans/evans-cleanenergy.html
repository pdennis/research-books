Then, Evans <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/sep/29/meet-americas-energy-demand-innovation-alone-isnt-enough/">defended</a> his vote to cut the credits, claiming the Republican budget bill was a sensible approach to clean energy tax credits. Since the beginning of the Trump administration, clean energy projects that were projected to create hundreds of jobs in Evans’ district have been <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2025/06/25/colorado-clean-energy-project-cancellations/">cancelled</a> or <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/07/13/colorado-renewable-energy-projects-trump-bill/">stalled</a>.</p>
<h2>Evans Voted Against Protecting Coloradans’ Clean Energy Jobs</h2>
<h3>Evans Voted to Cut Clean Energy Tax Credits that Supported Colorado Jobs</h3>
<h4>July 2025: Evans Voted For The Final Version Of Republicans’ Budget Bill, Which Repealed Electric Vehicle Tax Credits And Made It Harder For Projects To Qualify For Clean Energy Tax Credits</h4>
<p><strong>July 2025: Evans Voted For The Senate FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Extended $4 Trillion In Expiring Tax Cuts, Added New Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025, Evans voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, the “motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214.

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Republican Reconciliation Bill Restricted The Ability Of Projects To Qualify For Certain Clean Energy Tax Credits And Repealed Electric Vehicle Tax Credits.</strong> According to Utility Dive, "The bill restricts the ability of projects to qualify for the tech-neutral clean electricity 45Y production tax credit and 48E investment tax credit, shortens the timeline for those credits, and ends the 25D residential solar credit after this year. The 25E, 30D, 30C and 45W electric vehicle credits will terminate after Sept. 30. While clean energy advocates and congressional Democrats maintain that the final version of the bill goes too far in slashing IRA credits, some Republicans wanted to see more significant cuts."

  <li><strong>The Final Republican Reconciliation Bill Allowed Projects To Avoid A Requirement That They Be In Service By 2027 To Qualify For Certain Credits If They Began Construction Within A Year Of The Bill Being Signed.</strong>&nbsp;According to Utility Dive, "Before the House Freedom Caucus reached an agreement with House leadership to vote in favor of the bill, the caucus circulated a memo that criticized the Senate’s version of the bill for offering an exemption from the House’s onerous requirement that clean energy projects be placed in service by 2027 to qualify for the 45Y and 48E credits. The Senate version allows projects to avoid this requirement if they begin construction within a year after the bill is signed into law."

<h4>May 2025: Evans Voted For The House Republican Budget Bill, Which Cut Clean Energy Tax Credits Provided By The Inflation Reduction Act</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Evans Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Included $3.8 Trillion In Tax Cuts Offset By $1.5 Trillion In Spending Reductions To Programs Like Medicaid And The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</strong> In May 2025, Evans voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would provide for approximately $3.8 trillion in net tax cuts and $321 billion in military, border enforcement and judiciary spending, offset by $1.5 trillion in spending reductions, as instructed in the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). It would raise the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion and provide for increased spending on defense and border security, spending cuts on social safety net programs, such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It also includes a mix of tax breaks for businesses and individuals; tax increases on universities and foundations; and a phase-down of clean energy tax credits. […] It would reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by requiring states to shoulder more of the cost, expand work requirements for SNAP, extend programs authorized under the 2018 farm bill, and prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Program. As amended, it would cap state and local tax deductions at $40,000 for households with incomes below $500,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 215 to 214.

  <li><strong>The House Republican Budget Bill Included Cuts To Federal Tax Credits For Wind, Solar, Storage, And Other Clean Energy Projects.</strong> According to Utility Dive, "House Republicans on Thursday morning narrowly passed a sweeping budget bill that guts federal support for wind, solar, storage and other clean energy industries. The bill terminates most technology-neutral clean energy tax credits for projects placed in service after 2028 and those that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill’s passage. It also tightens restrictions on foreign entities’ involvement in projects, creating a ‘truly untenable’ situation for developers, Jefferies analysts said Thursday. Nuclear projects have more time to qualify for the credit."

  <li><strong>One Trade Association CEO Said The Bill Would Weaken Power Systems, Send Shockwaves Through The U.S. Economy, And Kill Tens Of Thousands Of Jobs.</strong> According to Utility Dive, "The House bill ‘abruptly dismantles bipartisan, long-standing tax policy that has catalyzed billions in private investment for affordable, reliable energy while sparking a rebirth of manufacturing across America,’ AEU President and CEO Heather O’Neill said. ‘If enacted as written, this bill will weaken our power system and send shockwaves throughout the U.S. economy by raising electricity prices, killing tens of thousands of jobs and ceding energy dominance to China.’" [Utility Dive,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-gop-budget-worse-than-feared-for-clean-energy-analysts/748862/">5/22/25</a>]</li>

<h3>Evans Signed Letters Asked Republicans to Protect Clean Energy Tax Credits Created by The Inflation Reduction Act</h3>
<h4>March 2025: Evans Signed A Letter Urging House Republican Leaders Not To Repeal Clean Energy Tax Credits Created By The Inflation Reduction Act</h4>
<p><strong>March 2025: Evans Signed A Letter Urging House Republican Leadership Not To Repeal Clean Energy Tax Credits In The Reconciliation Process.</strong> According to a letter led by Rep. Andrew Garbarino, "As Members of the House Republican Conference, we write to emphasize the importance of prioritizing energy affordability for American families and keeping on our current path to energy dominance amid efforts to repeal or reform current energy tax credits. We strongly support the Administration’s America First national energy dominance initiative. Continued energy expansion and innovation is necessary to bolster national security, create goodpaying American jobs, and guarantee energy independence. The United States continues to produce energy from a myriad of sources that are cleaner and more efficient than anywhere else in the world. As our conference has long believed, an all-of-the-above energy approach, combined with a robust advanced manufacturing sector, will help support the United States’ position as a global energy leader."&nbsp;[Letter, Rep.

<h4>June 2025: After Voting To Cut Inflation Reduction Act Clean Energy Tax Credits, Evans Signed A Letter Asking Senate Republicans To Scale Back The Same Cuts He Voted For</h4>
<p><strong>HEADLINE: "Moderate Republicans Are ‘Deeply Concerned’ About Provisions In The Reconciliation Bill They Voted For"</strong> [NOTUS,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.notus.org/congress/moderate-republicans-reconciliation-energy-tax-credit">6/6/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>June 2025: Evans Signed Letter Urging Senate Republicans To Scale Back Cuts To Clean Energy Tax Credits In The House GOP Budget Bill, Which She Voted For.</strong>&nbsp;According to NBC News, "Thirteen House Republicans who supported President Donald Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ sent a letter Friday urging Senate GOP leaders to scale back some of its clean energy cuts, sparking pushback from conservative hard-liners. The unusual criticism of their own bill indicates a modicum of regret by the GOP lawmakers, whose votes were critical to the bill passing the House by a narrow margin last month. ‘While we were proud to have worked to ensure that the bill did not include a full repeal of the clean energy tax credits, we remain deeply concerned by several provisions,’ said the Republicans in the letter, led by Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va." [NBC News,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/13-house-republicans-urge-senate-scale-back-clean-energy-cuts-bill-vot-rcna211516">6/6/25</a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Evans And His 12 GOP Colleagues Claimed The House GOP Budget Bill, That They Voted For, “Includes A Phase Out Schedule For Credits That Would Cause Significant Disruption To Projects Under Development And Stop Investments Needed To Win The Global Energy Race.”</strong>&nbsp;According to NBC News, "Kiggans, like most of the signatories, represents a competitive district that Democrats are targeting in the 2026 election. Other politically vulnerable members include: Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.; Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz.; Mike Lawler, R-N.Y.; Don Bacon, R-Neb.; Gabe Evans, R-Colo.; Young Kim, R-Calif.; David Valadao, R-Calif.; Rob Bresnahan, R-Pa.; and Tom Kean, R-N.J.&nbsp; The remaining three, who hold comparably safer seats, are Reps. Mark Amodei, R-Nev.; Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y.; and Nick LaLota, R-N.Y. Garbarino missed the vote, but praised the bill and said he was about to vote ‘yes’ and didn’t make it in time. It passed 215-214 in an early morning vote. The 13 Republicans warned that ‘the House-passed bill includes a phase out schedule for credits that would cause significant disruption to projects under development and stop investments needed to win the global energy race.’" [NBC News,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/13-house-republicans-urge-senate-scale-back-clean-energy-cuts-bill-vot-rcna211516">6/6/25</a>]</li>

<h3>September 2025: Evans Defended His Vote To Cut Clean Energy Tax Credits And Claimed The Bill Was A Sensible Approach</h3>
<p><strong>Evans&nbsp;Claimed The Republican Tax Bill Was A Sensible Approach To&nbsp;Clean Energy&nbsp;Tax Credits After Arguing That&nbsp;Clean Energy&nbsp;Tax Credits Were Critical To Energy Production.</strong>&nbsp;According to an opinion by Gabe&nbsp;Evans&nbsp;in the Washington Times, "But here’s the reality: innovation alone isn’t enough to meet our nation’s growing energy demand. For these resources to truly meet their potential, we must make them more accessible for American families and businesses to drive down costs and get more electrons on the grid.&nbsp;Clean energy&nbsp;tax credits are a critical component of this national strategy.&nbsp; These credits have helped fuel Colorado’s economy, creating new jobs, supporting small businesses and large companies alike, and attracting billions of dollars in private sector investment. They give families and businesses more choices, whether that be lowering their power bills or upgrading to better energy systems. […] We must have the infrastructure to support the next generation of energy technologies like geothermal and advanced storage. Transmission lines, pipelines, and modernized grids are all part of the equation. If we want affordable, reliable, and secure energy, we need the ability to move it where it is needed most. That’s why I alongside 20 other Republican members of Congress pushed for a sensible approach to the&nbsp;clean energy&nbsp;tax credits in the Working Families Tax Credit bill, which was signed into law in July."

<p><strong>May 2025: Amprius Technologies, Which Had Planned To Open A Large Lithium-Ion Battery Manufacturing Facility In Brighton, CO, Paused Its Plan To Move To The Next Phase, Citing “Market Dynamics.”</strong>&nbsp;According to the Denver Post, "Amprius Technologies announced in 2023 that it would open a 775,000-square-foot lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility in Brighton that would employ about 330 people in the first phases. But in May, the California company told shareholders that it was pausing the project as it monitors ‘market dynamics.’&nbsp; Amprius CEO Kang Sun said in a statement that while the company has completed the plant’s design, there are no immediate plans to move forward to the next phase. Producing cutting-edge battery technologies at scale in the U.S. requires ‘a highly capital-intensive process’ and technical expertise that is still developing, he said.&nbsp; ‘Meanwhile, other countries have spent years building mature, cost-efficient battery industries, giving them a significant head start,’ Sun said."
