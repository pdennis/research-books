## **Evans Repeatedly Refused To Condemn Beating Kids In Public Schools**

**HEADLINE: “On Debate Stage, Gabe Evans Declined To Condemn Child Beatings”** \[Colorado Times Recorder, [_10/10/24_](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2024/10/on-debate-stage-gabe-evans-declined-to-condemn-child-beatings/65003/)\]

**10/8/24: Asked Three Times When It Was Acceptable To Hit A Child, Evans Never Responded To The Question Directly.** According to Colorado Pols, "MODERATOR: When do you believe that it is acceptable to hit a child at home and at school? EVANS: That answer is already in the law right now. It’s in title 18-1-703, so you can go refer to the law where it talks about the special exception that parents and guardians have when they are tasked with the upbringing for a minor. But I want to address something you mentioned…  MODERATOR: How about public schools? When is it appropriate for a child to be hit in public school? EVANS: We…we need to ensure that we are providing a safe place for our kids to be able to learn in our public schools. I was a part-time school resource…  MODERATOR: There was a security exception. This went beyond the security exception when people needed to be able to control children for safety reasons. When should children be hit in school? EVANS: I was a part-time school resource officer, for about two years, at my, uh, law enforcement agency. And so one of the biggest things that I hear from teachers is… MODERATOR: I apologize sir, if you’re not going to answer the question, we’re going to use the time.” \[Colorado Pols, [_10/9/24_](https://www.coloradopols.com/diary/206547/gabe-evans-cant-answer-question-on-when-is-it-okay-to-hit-children); Colorado 8th District Congressional Debate, [_10/8/24_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vRW0nb_Tnc)\] (video)

That bill ultimately passed the state House 48 to 16 and the state Senate 32 to 3 before being signed by the governor.” \[Colorado Times Recorder, [_10/10/24_](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2024/10/on-debate-stage-gabe-evans-declined-to-condemn-child-beatings/65003/)\]

-   **3/15/23: Evans Voted Against A Bill That Banned Corporal Punishment Of Children In Colorado Schools.** According to the Colorado General Assembly, Gabe Evans voted against HB23-1191, “Prohibit Corporal Punishment Of Children.” The bill passed the House in a 48-16-1 vote.

-   **The Bill Defined Corporal Punishment As The “Willful Infliction Of, Or Willfully Causing The Infliction Of, Physical Pain On A Child.”** According to the Colorado General Assembly HB23-1191 bill summary, “The act prohibits a person employed by or volunteering in a public school, a state-licensed child care center, a family child care home, or a specialized group facility from imposing corporal punishment on a child. The act defines ‘corporal punishment’ as the willful infliction of, or willfully causing the infliction of, physical pain on a child.” \[Colorado General Assembly, HB23-1191, viewed [_3/11/25_](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb23-1191)\]

### Evans Was a Member of Heritage Defense, a Group that Defended Parents’ Use of Corporal Punishment Against Children

**Evans Was A Member Of The Conservative, Biblical Group “Heritage Defense.”** According to the Colorado Times Recorder, "Evans listed his status as a Heritage Defense member and contributor on a voter guide he filled out during his primary race earlier this year. And while it went unnoticed until the debate, his affiliation with a conservative biblical group that serves Christian homeschoolers can’t be considered all that surprising given his campaign endorsers and his academic background."
