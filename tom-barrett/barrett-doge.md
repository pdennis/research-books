## Overview

As DOGE triggered mass federal layoffs and agency slowdowns, Barrett minimized the fallout, telling constituents programs were merely [“paused and under review.”](https://apnews.com/article/musk-trump-doge-social-security-92de2ce547df0dcdcc00a5876e1a7bd6) But DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) [ability](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/) to [deliver services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. More than [171,000 Michiganders](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/mi.pdf) in Barrett’s district relied on Social Security benefits.

He [defended](https://heartlandsignal.com/2025/03/31/michigan-rep-tom-barrett-defends-nih-cuts/) Trump moves to slash National Institutes of Health funding, calling it a “reasonable approach,” even as Michigan State University leaders said proposed cuts would be a [“deathblow”](https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2025/02/trump-nih-cuts-could-be-a-deathblow-for-critical-research-on-grand-rapids-medical-mile.html) for critical medical research. 

Barrett’s own March 2025 tele-town hall showed the backlash: [70% of participants said they disapproved of DOGE](https://www.wkar.org/wkar-news/2025-03-11/more-than-two-thirds-of-rep-barrett-town-hall-attendees-say-they-dont-support-doge).

## **Barrett Defended DOGE And Its Sweeping Cuts, Despite 70 Percent Of His Tele-Town Hall Attendees Saying They Disapproved Of The Agency**

### Barrett Defended Doge, Claiming It Was “only Giving Recommendations” 

**Barrett Claimed DOGE Was “Only Giving Recommendations.”** According to the Associated Press, "Barrett opened a telephone town hall in his mid-Michigan district Monday night by addressing the flood of concerns over DOGE he said his office had been receiving. Barrett stressed that Musk is merely an adviser and said programs are ‘temporarily paused and under review.’ ‘I want to be very clear that this does not include Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid,’ he said. ‘Again, this does not include Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. It’s important to keep in mind that DOGE is only giving recommendations.’" \[Associated Press, [3/15/25](https://apnews.com/article/musk-trump-doge-social-security-92de2ce547df0dcdcc00a5876e1a7bd6)\]

Tom Barrett’s constituents present during a telephone town hall said they don’t approve of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.  Barrett ran surveys between taking questions during his first telephone town hall Monday evening. 70% of the participants indicated they do not support the department’s mission, which was presented as being ‘to streamline the federal government and reduce spending.’  The first-term member of Congress defended the department earlier in the call." \[WKAR, [3/11/25](https://www.wkar.org/wkar-news/2025-03-11/more-than-two-thirds-of-rep-barrett-town-hall-attendees-say-they-dont-support-doge)\]

#### While Talk About America's Aging Population, Barrett Said Lawmakers Would Have To Make Tough Decisions About Federal Spending

**Barrett: “At The End Of The Day, We Have To Be Prepared To Make Tough Decisions To Streamline Our Government Agencies And Hopefully Save Us Money And Deliver Better Government Assistance To People Who Need It Most.”** According to a tele-town hall hosted by Rep. Tom Barrett, “BARRETT: Thank you Michael, for the question  And, you know, you're absolutely right. Our deficits have blown up in the last few decades as we've fought foreign wars that have lasted decades plural. We've committed American troops to foreign conflicts. We've, you know, expanded benefits to people, whether that's through Medicaid expansion, whether that's to other programs as a result. We certainly have an aging population and people that have taken advantage of the benefits that they've earned through programs that were set up decades ago. All of which have combined to stack up our deficit and overall grown our debt. You know, at the end of the day, we have to be prepared to make tough decisions to streamline our government agencies and hopefully save us money and deliver better government assistance to people who need it most by protecting programs that really are critical. I think we can all agree that there are certain programs that are really critical to beneficiaries that need to have access to them, and there are things that people have taken advantage of that we ought to be watchful against.” \[Rep Tom Barrett Tele-Town Hall, [4/7/25](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/rep-tom-barrett-tele-town-hall-4725/s-WKNtUxoDGgA?si=6e04c20d6e434a6a9f10c98f4c287db6&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)\] (audio)

The NIH, meanwhile, hasn’t increased its grants to meet that rate in over 20 years, and a drastic cut to indirect funding amounts to a ‘deathblow’ for critical research, Lipton said." \[M Live, [2/20/25](https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2025/02/trump-nih-cuts-could-be-a-deathblow-for-critical-research-on-grand-rapids-medical-mile.html)\]
