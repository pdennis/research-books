Scott, Buchanan, Steube, Mast, Donalds, Diaz-Balart, Gimenez, Salazar" regarding advancing plan for budget reconciliation. \[Sarasota Herald Tribune (Florida), [2/7/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6203-B8B1-JBCN-40NB-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2023: María Salazar Voted Against 2022 Government Funding Bill Due to Wasteful Spending** According to an opinion piece by Maria Elvira Salazar in Miami Herald, "Although valid projects like mine were included, the bill, unfortunately, was also loaded up with bad policies like spending millions to study Russian cats walking on a treadmill, among countless others, and totaling a whopping \$1.7 trillion, \$200 billion more than the previous year. \[...\] I did not agree with that shameful practice or with wasteful measures, so I voted against the bill in final passage." \[Maria Elvira Salazar - Miami Herald, [2/2/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B7T-N9G1-DYJM-M026-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

#### Infrastructure and Community Development Funding

**2021-2024: María Salazar Opposed Infrastructure Bill Over Cost and Corporate Subsidies** According to an opinion piece by Maria Elvira Salazar in Miami Herald, "We have countless roads, bridges, ports, and airports that need improved.

It was irresponsible legislation in the form it was presented on the floor. I stand by my vote." \[Maria Elvira Salazar - Miami Herald, [2/2/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B7T-N9G1-DYJM-M026-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

Worst of all, there were no protections to prevent corporations from taking these investments outside of the U.S - in effect our tax dollars could be spent to create microchip industries in other countries. I couldn't support that." \[Maria Elvira Salazar - Miami Herald, [2/2/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B7T-N9G1-DYJM-M026-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
