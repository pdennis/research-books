**Rep. Salazar Congratulated Cutler Bay For Achieving CRS 3 Classification, Saving Residents 35 Percent On Flood Insurance** According to South Miami News, "Rep. Salazar congratulated the mayor and town staff for their success with FEMA's Community Rating System (CRS) which resulted in Cutler Bay being named as one of four communities in Florida, and only one of 11 communities out of 1,754 nationwide, to reach the classification of CRS 3. This classification saves residents 35 percent on flood insurance." \[South Miami News (Florida), [1/23/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B5G-GKR1-DXVP-T28G-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
