# Fisheries and Aquaculture Policy

### Summary

-   In 2022, Congresswoman María Salazar helped introduce the bipartisan Youth Coastal Fishing Program Act to promote youth fishing and marine science education ([South Florida Sun-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6747-KX41-JBM5-R543-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The proposed bill would establish a \$2 million grant program within NOAA to support projects offering fishing trips and marine conservation education for children.

-   Salazar emphasized the bill's importance in giving young Americans hands-on experiences with oceans, seas, and lakes, fostering both enjoyment and understanding of aquatic environments.

-   The legislation prioritizes underserved communities, directing grants to initiatives that provide fishing opportunities and marine science learning for children from diverse backgrounds.

-   If not sufficiently funded or implemented, the program may struggle to reach its goal of broad access and meaningful impact for all targeted youth.
