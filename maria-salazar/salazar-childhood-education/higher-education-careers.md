#### Inspiration to Enter Media

**Salazar Was Inspired To Run After GOP Donor Approached Her In 2017** According to Miami Herald, "Salazar said she didn't think about running for office until a GOP donor approached her in 2017 about the possibility of replacing Ros-Lehtinen. Further conversation with party leaders, and Ros-Lehtinen herself, convinced Salazar that transitioning from one type of public service in journalism to an elected position would be feasible for her." \[Miami Herald, [10/5/18](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5TF4-6XX1-DYJM-M49M-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
