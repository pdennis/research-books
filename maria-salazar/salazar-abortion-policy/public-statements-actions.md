# Public Statements and Political Actions

### Summary

-   Salazar has been targeted by opponents as a "MAGA Republican" and criticized heavily for her strong anti-abortion record ([Florida Jolt, 9/23/22](https://floridajolt.com/cnn-florida-republican-rep-salazar-in-pretty-good-shape-difficult-for-dems-to-keep-majority/)).

-   Attack ads have accused Salazar of supporting strict abortion bans with no exceptions for rape or incest, potentially alienating moderate voters ([Miami Times, 11/2/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66W0-54F1-JBHT-D2MT-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar has closely aligned herself with national pro-life organizations, such as receiving an A+ rating from SBA Pro-Life America, which could be polarizing in a competitive district ([Palm Beach Post, 4/7/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BRH-SHN1-JB1V-G142-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar has avoided public comment on sensitive topics like recent Florida court abortion rulings, potentially giving the impression of evasiveness or lack of transparency ([Palm Beach Post, 4/7/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BRH-SHN1-JB1V-G142-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Persistent characterizations by opponents aiming to tie her to extreme or out-of-touch positions may weaken her support among independents.
