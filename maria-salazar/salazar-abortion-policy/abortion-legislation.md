# Positions on Abortion Legislation

### Summary

-   Maria Elvira Salazar celebrated the Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade and has consistently maintained an anti-abortion stance ([Floricua News](https://floricuanews.com/2024/05/13/10-things-to-know-about-congresswoman-maria-elvira-salazar/), [Orlando Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66MT-8SC1-DY37-F051-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar has voted to restrict access to abortion medication, specifically mifepristone, and supported measures eliminating reproductive care resources for active-duty service members ([Palm Beach Post - mifepristone](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BRH-SHN1-JB1V-G142-00000-00&context=1519360), [Palm Beach Post - service members](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BRH-SHN1-JB1V-G142-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She has not sponsored or co-sponsored nationwide abortion ban legislation, such as the Life at Conception Act ([Palm Beach Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BRH-SHN1-JB1V-G142-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar has avoided taking a clear public position on Florida's Amendment 4, expressing criticism of its language as "vague" while also describing Florida's current six-week abortion ban as "complicated" ([Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article293713594.html), [El Nuevo Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5F-FW61-DYJM-M04X-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She has voiced approval that Florida voters will decide the state's abortion laws directly, emphasizing the importance of democratic choice ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5F-FW61-DYJM-M087-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerability: Salazar's reluctance to state a definitive position on state-level abortion amendments, combined with her votes restricting abortion access, may be seen as ambiguous or inconsistent by both supporters and critics.
