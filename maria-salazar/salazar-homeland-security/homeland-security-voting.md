# Legislation and Voting Record on Homeland Security and Terrorism

### Summary

-   In June 2024, Rep. María Elvira Salazar introduced the Secure Airports from Enemies (SAFE) Act, aiming to block state sponsors of terrorism---such as Cuba---from accessing sensitive U.S. airport security facilities ([Free Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C76-JVF1-DXVP-T4SS-00000-00&context=1519360), 6/9/24).

-   Salazar led a bipartisan group of Florida lawmakers, including both House Representatives and Senator Marco Rubio, to back the SAFE Act in both chambers of Congress ([Free Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C76-JVF1-DXVP-T4SS-00000-00&context=1519360), 6/9/24).

-   The bill was prompted by an incident in which Cuban officials were granted access to TSA antiterrorism facilities at Miami International Airport, a decision made by the Biden administration and strongly criticized by Salazar and her allies as a national security risk ([Free Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C76-JVF1-DXVP-T4SS-00000-00&context=1519360), 6/9/24).

-   Salazar is not a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, although she has participated in activities and visits with committee members ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6272-76T1-JC3J-X531-00000-00&context=1519360), 3/15/21).

-   The incident exposing TSA facilities to Cuban officials highlights a potential vulnerability in U.S. homeland security policy, which Salazar and her colleagues are seeking to address through new legislation.
