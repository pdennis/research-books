**2021: Florida Times-Union Reported Salazar Studied Art Therapy Post-Service** According to Florida Times-Union, "She went back to school to study art therapy so she could understand why and how art is an avenue to healing. A required ceramics course gave her the medium she found most effective because of the intimacy between artist and medium, the ability to create something out of a ball of mud and the need to tap into all five senses." \[Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville), [7/17/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:635D-47R1-JBSS-G3YN-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
