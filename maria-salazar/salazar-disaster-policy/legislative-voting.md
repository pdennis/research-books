# Legislative Initiatives and Voting Record

### Summary

-   In July 2021, Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar introduced the bipartisan Rebuilding Communities After Disasters Act to double the Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster loan limits for homeowners affected by major storms ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6329-24Y1-DYJM-M01F-00000-00&context=1519360), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6329-XG51-DYTM-N00T-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The bill proposed raising the maximum SBA loan for home repairs from \$200,000 to \$400,000, and for replacing household and personal belongings from \$40,000 to \$75,000, reflecting the increased cost of recovery after disasters ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6329-24Y1-DYJM-M01F-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar's legislation received broad bipartisan support, with 35 co-sponsors across both parties, including Reps. Carlos Gimenez, Brian Mast, and Charlie Crist ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6329-24Y1-DYJM-M01F-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Her office argued that the existing SBA disaster loan limits, unchanged since 1994, are outdated and not reflective of current home prices or post-disaster needs ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6329-XG51-DYTM-N00T-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar emphasized the need to modernize disaster assistance programs to ensure coastal communities can rebuild effectively in the face of rising home costs and more frequent storms ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6329-XG51-DYTM-N00T-00000-00&context=1519360)).
