# Public Statements, Controversies, and Media Coverage

### Summary

-   María Elvira Salazar has faced scrutiny for amplifying false claims about the 2020 election, especially regarding Pennsylvania's vote, which led to criticism from media editorials and accusations of spreading misinformation ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:62V4-J6T1-DYJM-M2XJ-00000-00&context=1519360), [El Nuevo Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:62V7-5N81-JC3J-X4K8-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar initially supported the creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate the January 6 Capitol attack but voted against the final committee version, calling it a "partisan show" and facing both far-right criticism and media scrutiny for her shifting stance ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65HC-KN61-JC3J-X0MV-00000-00&context=1519360), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:62R0-YP21-DYTM-N1T4-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She has sometimes declined to clarify or delayed responses regarding her positions or votes on controversial issues, leaving her vulnerable to charges of evasiveness and inconsistent communication with constituents ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:61PB-D3W1-JC3J-X0JV-00000-00&context=1519360), [El Nuevo Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B78-CBG1-DYJM-M048-00000-00&context=1519360)).
