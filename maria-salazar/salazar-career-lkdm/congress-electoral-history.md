# Congressional Service and Electoral History

### Summary

-   María Elvira Salazar was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for Florida's 27th District in 2020, defeating incumbent Democrat Donna Shalala in a closely watched and competitive race, then successfully defended her seat in 2022 and 2024 ([Miami Herald, 11/3/20](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:616X-WYD1-DYJM-M1BN-00000-00&context=1519360), [El Nuevo Herald, 2/22/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BD0-CNN1-JC3J-X50B-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar's initial win in 2020 flipped the district from Democratic to Republican, marking a notable shift in Miami-Dade's political landscape and contributing to the GOP's increased diversity in Congress ([NBC - 8 WFLA, 6/8/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C6Y-TC61-DXVP-T024-00000-00&context=1519360), [Miami Herald, 11/23/20](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:61C1-N4J1-JC3J-X0DK-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She won reelection in 2022 by a significantly larger margin (about 14-15 percentage points) against Democratic challenger Annette Taddeo, following redistricting that made the district more favorable to Republicans ([Miami Herald, 11/8/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66TN-G021-DYJM-M169-00000-00&context=1519360), [Tampa Bay Times, 5/16/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C23-3BM1-DYTM-N003-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Although Florida's 27th District has been highly competitive and was considered "vulnerable" or a key Democratic target due to its diverse, Hispanic-majority electorate and narrow past margins, Salazar has maintained incumbency, and recent elections have seen her favored for reelection ([Tampa Bay Times, 7/22/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6608-G6N1-JCBJ-Y1XT-00000-00&context=1519360), [Cook Political Report via Miami Herald, 8/20/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CSG-9SW1-JC3J-X01G-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar has served on key committees, including chairing the House's Western Hemisphere Foreign Affairs Subcommittee as of 2025, and has focused on both local constituent service and foreign policy ([Orlando Sentinel, 3/15/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FBG-FC63-RS7N-1095-00000-00&context=1519360), [Miami Herald, 2/4/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:61XV-5561-DYJM-M29F-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Despite recent advantages, her district remains demographically diverse and was recently considered one of the most competitive in Florida, suggesting the potential for future electoral vulnerability ([Tampa Bay Times, 6/26/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68JX-JS31-JCBJ-Y0H2-00000-00&context=1519360), [South Florida Sun-Sentinel, 6/17/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C8W-H241-JBM5-R07J-00000-00&context=1519360)).
