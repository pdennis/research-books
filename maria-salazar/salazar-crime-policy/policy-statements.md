# Policy Positions and Public Statements

### Summary

-   In 2021, Parkland parents expressed hope that Maria Elvira Salazar would work with them on improving school safety, as she was seen as a potential ally despite not having established relationships with them yet ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6208-06Y1-DYTM-N4CD-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   During a 2024 Republican National Convention panel, Salazar made controversial comments suggesting the U.S. should "kill" certain members of the Venezuelan gang El Tren de Aragua who entered the country illegally ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5F-FW61-DYJM-M087-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   After public backlash, Salazar's office clarified that her position was to support deporting gang members, not killing them ([El Nuevo Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5F-FW61-DYJM-M04X-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar's original remarks about gang violence and subsequent retraction have exposed her to criticism and highlight potential vulnerabilities regarding her approach to public safety and communication.

**2021: Parkland Parents Expressed Hope For Working With Maria Elvira Salazar On School Safety** According to Tampa Bay Times, "And the parents also said Gimenez and Salazar's votes give them hope that they'll have two more members who will work with them on school safety issues. None of the parents currently have close relationships with Gimenez and Salazar like they do with Diaz-Balart, because they were recently elected." \[Tampa Bay Times, [2/10/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6208-06Y1-DYTM-N4CD-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2024: Salazar Walked Back Comments About Killing Gang Members** According to Miami Herald, "In July, during a panel discussion at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Salazar stirred controversy when she said that the U.S. should 'kill' some members of the Venezuelan gang El Tren de Aragua who illegally enter the country.

#### Support for Law Enforcement Agencies
