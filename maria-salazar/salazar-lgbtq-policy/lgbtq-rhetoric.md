# Public Statements and Rhetoric on LGBTQ Issues

### Summary

-   Salazar's repeated statements claiming to be an ally of the LGBTQ community may be undermined by votes interpreted as exclusionary, leaving her open to accusations of hypocrisy ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6724-JGF1-DYJM-M2F3-00000-00), [El Nuevo Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:672T-4F41-JC3J-X2X1-00000-00)).

-   High-profile local opinion writers have accused Salazar of sending a message to LGBTQ+ constituents that their families are less valued, aligning her with broader Republican attacks on LGBTQ rights ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6724-JGF1-DYJM-M2F3-00000-00)).

-   Statements from advocacy leaders highlight that Salazar is aware of her LGBTQ constituents and personal connections, yet critics question whether her actions match her rhetoric ([South Florida Sun-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:662C-1XF1-JBM5-R1PS-00000-00)).

-   Coverage in both English and Spanish-language media risks amplifying negative perceptions about her support for LGBTQ equality among diverse voter groups ([El Nuevo Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:672T-4F41-JC3J-X2X1-00000-00), [Orlando Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:662C-HN71-DY37-F224-00000-00)).

-   Public scrutiny of her votes in the context of broader Republican legislative actions on LGBTQ rights could dampen her credibility with moderate and LGBTQ-friendly voters ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6724-JGF1-DYJM-M2F3-00000-00)).
