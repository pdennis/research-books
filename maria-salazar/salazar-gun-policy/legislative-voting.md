# Legislative Actions and Voting Record

### Summary

-   Maria Elvira Salazar has expressed support for, and voted in favor of, expanding background checks on gun purchases, including backing the Bipartisan Background Checks Act in March 2021 ([Miami Herald, 3/11/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6263-58B1-DYJM-M2T6-00000-00&context=1519360); [El Nuevo Herald, 3/12/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:626D-G5M1-DYJM-M1F9-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar was the only Florida Republican in the U.S. House to vote for the landmark bipartisan gun-control bill after the Uvalde school shooting ([Miami Herald, 10/18/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66N1-XCD1-DYJM-M0P7-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She has openly supported measures such as raising the purchase age for assault-style rifles from 18 to 21 and has indicated willingness to consider an assault weapons ban ([Miami Herald, 10/11/24](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article293713594.html); [Editorial - Miami Herald, 10/21/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D7K-5FW1-DYJM-M26N-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   During her 2018 campaign and since, Salazar voiced support for universal background checks and closing the gun show loophole, and has at times been open to other gun control and early intervention proposals ([Miami Herald, 10/14/18](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5TGN-8J71-DYJM-M15Y-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Despite bipartisan votes on some measures, Salazar has faced criticism and a potential vulnerability from both sides: she opposed certain amendments to strengthen firearm transfer restrictions and extend FBI review periods, and has questioned the effectiveness of raising the purchase age, which may be viewed as inconsistency on gun regulation ([El Nuevo Herald, 3/12/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:626D-G5M1-DYJM-M1F9-00000-00&context=1519360); [Miami Herald, 10/5/18](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5TF4-6XX1-DYJM-M49M-00000-00&context=1519360)).
