# Statements and Engagements on Broader Civil Liberties

### Summary

-   In October 2018, Salazar condemned aggressive protests at a political event and emphasized her commitment to protecting free speech rights, urging both political sides to denounce such actions ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5TJ2-FDY1-JC3J-X1X5-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar has frequently invoked the First Amendment, criticizing Democrats for allegedly fearing Hispanic opposition to socialism and for restricting free speech ([El Nuevo Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:62GK-V3D1-JC3J-X42M-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   In 2023, Salazar introduced a bill to ban the use of the term "Latinx" in executive branch documents, arguing that it is a "woke invention" of the left and an attack on Hispanic identity and language ([NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:683X-6FD1-DXVP-T44K-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar has publicly criticized the Biden Administration for its use of "Latinx," claiming it imposes progressive ideology on the Hispanic community ([NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:683X-6FD1-DXVP-T44K-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   In February 2021, Salazar voted to remove Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from House committees, breaking with Republican leadership and stating all members of Congress should be held to high standards of accountability ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:61XV-5561-DYJM-M29G-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerability: Salazar's strong stance against the term "Latinx" and her framing of it as a partisan issue may alienate some progressive or younger Hispanic voters who support inclusive language.

### Freedom of Speech and Political Expression

#### Statements on censorship or artistic expression

**October 2018: Salazar Distanced Herself From Protest At Shalala Campaign Event** According to Miami Herald, "In a statement to the Herald, Salazar distanced herself from the protest, saying her campaign 'did not participate in the protest, much less encourage this behavior.' 'We strongly condemn this and any acts of aggression and reckless mob-like actions,' she said. 'The right to free speech is sacred and must always be protected, regardless of how distasteful a view a person may have. It is our sincere hope that those on the right and the left condemn these acts.'" \[Miami Herald, [10/20/18](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5TJ2-FDY1-JC3J-X1X5-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**April 2021: Salazar Cited First Amendment And Accused Democrats Of Fearing Hispanic Rejection Of Socialism** According to El Nuevo Herald, '¡La Primera Enmienda es sagrada y está claro cómo los demócratas están aterrorizados por el creciente número de hispanos que RECHAZAN su extremismo socialista!', tuiteó este martes Salazar, representante por el distrito 27 de Miami desde su perfil personal de Twitter en respuesta a un tuit del comisionado de la Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones (FCC), Brendan Carr \[...\] \[El Nuevo Herald, [4/20/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:62GK-V3D1-JC3J-X42M-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**April 2023: Rep. María Elvira Salazar Introduced Bill To Ban** '**Latinx**' **In Executive Branch Documents** According to NBC - 8 WFLA: Web Edition Articles (Florida), "Rep. María Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.) on Wednesday introduced a bill to ban the use of the term 'Latinx' in public executive branch documents." \[NBC - 8 WFLA: Web Edition Articles (Florida), [4/26/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:683X-6FD1-DXVP-T44K-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2023: Salazar Criticized Use Of** '**Latinx**' **By Biden Administration** According to NBC - 8 WFLA: Web Edition Articles (Florida), 'The Biden Administration is waging a woke crusade on Latino identity and the Spanish language,' Salazar said in a statement. 'We cannot allow the Biden Administration to use White House communications to attack our language and impose progressive ideology on our people.' \[NBC - 8 WFLA: Web Edition Articles (Florida), [4/26/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:683X-6FD1-DXVP-T44K-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2023: Salazar Described** '**Latinx**' **As A** '**Woke Invention**' **By The Left** According to NBC - 8 WFLA: Web Edition Articles (Florida), "'Latinx' is a woke invention of the neo-Marxist left and as such should never be used to refer to someone of Latin American or Hispanic ancestry. Far-left professors in universities introduced the term in 2004 with the sole purpose of infiltrating the Hispanic community with gender ideology. Despite the push by college campuses to use the word, the public continues to reject it," reads Salazar's press release. \[NBC - 8 WFLA: Web Edition Articles (Florida), [4/26/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:683X-6FD1-DXVP-T44K-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Accountability, Transparency, and Congressional Conduct

#### 2021: Statement on Congressional Accountability

**February 2021: Salazar Voted To Remove Marjorie Taylor Greene From House Committees** According to Miami Herald, "The votes by Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Gimenez and Maria Elvira Salazar came as a surprise at the last moment during a 30-minute vote late Thursday. They bucked House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, part of a group of Republicans who waited till the end to cast their 'yes' votes for a resolution authored by Broward Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz." \[Miami Herald, [2/4/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:61XV-5561-DYJM-M29G-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**February 2021: Salazar Cited Holding Colleagues To New Standard After Greene Vote** According to Miami Herald, "'Voting against a member of your own party is never easy, but everyone in Congress must be held to the same high standard,' Salazar said in a statement shortly after the vote. 'I had to hold Marjorie Taylor Greene accountable for her denial of the Parkland massacre, the Flight 77 crash and accusing a Jewish family of starting the California wildfires. From now on, I will hold every Democrat to this new standard that they have created.'" \[Miami Herald, [2/4/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:61XV-5561-DYJM-M29G-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
