# Voting Record and Stances on Key Civil Rights Policies

### Summary

-   María Elvira Salazar voted against the Equality Act (HR 5) in February 2021, which sought to expand civil rights protections to LGBTQ individuals by outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity ([Sarasota Herald Tribune](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:623P-VY71-DXVP-V4KS-00000-00&context=1519360); [Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:63G7-DFT1-DYJM-M0CH-00000-00&context=1519360); [Bradenton Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66T9-GN31-DYJM-M1X0-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   In June 2021, Salazar was the only South Florida representative to vote "no" on a bill to remove Confederate statues and other figures who defended slavery from the U.S. Capitol, and did not provide a public explanation for her vote ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:631S-DFN1-JC3J-X0JF-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   In January 2022, she also voted against legislation (HR 5746) aimed at strengthening federal voting rights and combating discrimination in voting practices ([Bradenton Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66T9-GN31-DYJM-M1X0-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar has publicly accused the Black Lives Matter movement and leading Democrats of promoting socialism, reflecting a critical stance toward prominent racial justice initiatives ([Miami Herald opinion](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6186-2M11-DYJM-M312-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Her voting record and public statements on civil rights issues could be viewed as potential vulnerabilities, especially regarding minority and LGBTQ rights, and her opposition to removing Confederate symbols.
