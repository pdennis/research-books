# Community Engagement and Reunification

### Summary

-   Immigration policy is a major concern in María Elvira Salazar's district, particularly due to the impacts of the Cuban government's response to protests and the resulting exodus of Cubans ([Florida Times-Union, 3/2/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67NW-0VK1-JBSS-G1W9-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar emphasized that her district supports her stance on immigration and appreciates her advocacy on the issue ([Florida Times-Union, 3/2/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67NW-0VK1-JBSS-G1W9-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Proposed travel bans on Cuban and Venezuelan nationals present a dilemma for Salazar and other Miami congressional members, as these measures could harm many constituents with family ties to those countries ([Orlando Sentinel, 3/15/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FBG-FC63-RS7N-1095-00000-00&context=1519360); [Sun-Sentinel, 3/19/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FCR-XB53-RRWF-P2VY-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The political climate forces Salazar and her colleagues to choose between opposing Trump administration policies or supporting actions that may negatively affect their own community ([Sun-Sentinel, 3/19/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FCR-XB53-RRWF-P2VY-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   This dynamic creates a vulnerability where representatives may face backlash from either party leadership or constituents, depending on their stance regarding controversial immigration and travel policies.
