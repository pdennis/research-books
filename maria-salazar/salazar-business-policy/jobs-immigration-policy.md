# Jobs, Immigration, and Workforce Policy

### Summary

-   In 2021, Salazar stated she was developing a plan to use her salary to help people find jobs, emphasizing her commitment to employment initiatives ([Miami Herald, 2/26/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:623S-4M41-DYJM-M54S-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   By 2022, Salazar proposed that restitution funds be directed into an American Worker Fund to support workforce training for U.S. citizens ([Miami Herald, 2/8/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:64R9-DK71-JC3J-X415-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar suggested the concept of charging restitution---suggesting \$1,000 a year---for living in the U.S., tying it directly to workforce funding ([Miami Herald, 2/8/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:64R9-DK71-JC3J-X415-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   In July 2024, Salazar emphasized a need for workers in sectors such as agriculture, janitorial services, and construction, highlighting ongoing labor shortages ([Tampa Bay Times, 7/17/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CH3-9K61-JCBJ-Y00J-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   A potential vulnerability is that specific details and implementation strategies for her proposed workforce initiatives remain unclear, raising questions about their feasibility and impact.
