# Legislative Actions and Policy Positions

### Summary

-   Salazar has received criticism for accepting campaign donations from Victor Manuel Rocha, an accused Cuban spy, and faced questions about the adequacy and timing of returning the funds ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69TS-KP91-JC3J-X3KD-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She has been accused by local opponent Báez-Geller of voting against her district's best interests and not effectively advocating for community needs ([Islander News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CPW-5Y11-DXVP-T05F-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Salazar's strong stance against former lawmakers becoming lobbyists---including criticism of former Rep. Ros-Lehtinen---could be perceived as politically motivated or inconsistent, depending on her own future actions ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5Y7S-DBK1-DYJM-M35G-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Her invocation of Reagan-era foreign policy approaches to Central America and comments urging Trump to intervene in gang violence may be seen as dated or not fully addressing root causes of migration ([El Nuevo Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5WPT-GDT1-DYJM-M21X-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   While seeking bipartisan immigration reform with Democrat Veronica Escobar, Salazar may risk criticism from both the right and left if perceived as too compromising or ineffective ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C23-3BM1-DYTM-N003-00000-00&context=1519360)).
