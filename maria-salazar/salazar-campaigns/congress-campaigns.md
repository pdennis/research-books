# Congressional Campaigns and Elections

### Summary

-   María Elvira Salazar ran multiple competitive campaigns for Florida's 27th Congressional District, initially losing to Democrat Donna Shalala in 2018 by six percentage points but securing the seat in a 2020 rematch with a narrow victory [Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5TNP-46V1-DYJM-M210-00000-00), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:615X-VMJ1-JCBJ-Y2YD-00000-00).

-   Salazar consistently received strong support from national and local GOP leaders, notably including endorsements from Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Marco Rubio, Ron DeSantis, Mike Pompeo, and House Republican leadership [Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66MT-8SC1-DY37-F051-00000-00), [El Nuevo Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5T9H-9V71-DYJM-M1W8-00000-00).

-   She often ran on platforms focused on the economy, anti-socialism/anti-communism themes, and support for law enforcement, which resonated with Cuban-American and Hispanic voters, especially in Miami-Dade [Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:616X-WYD1-DYJM-M1BN-00000-00), [El Nuevo Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBX-7KM1-JC3J-X3R7-00000-00).

-   Despite occasional internal and independent polling showing close races, Salazar's broad name recognition, strong fundraising, and support from the local Cuban-American community helped secure her repeated electoral successes [Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:616X-WYD1-DYJM-M1BN-00000-00), [Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CSG-9SW1-JC3J-X01G-00000-00).
