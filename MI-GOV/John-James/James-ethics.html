<p><strong>August 2025: Michigan Resident, Joel Rutherford, Filed A House Ethics Complaint Alleging John James Used His Congressional Office To Support His Gubernatorial Campaign.</strong> According to the Michigan Independent, “One of John James’ constituents in Michigan’s 10th Congressional District, Joel Rutherford, filed a complaint against John James with the U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee on Aug. 22, requesting an investigation into the matter, which stems from a backpack giveaway the Shelby Township Republican hosted in Utica two days prior. John James’ office publicized the event in a press release on congressional letterhead as a community giveaway to provide free backpacks and school supplies ahead of the school year. In photos of the event posted to social media, however, a staffer can be seen wearing a ‘ John James for Governor’ T-shirt near a table of backpacks with the same branding.” [Michigan Independent, <a href="https://michiganindependent.com/politics/ethics-complaint-john-james-campaign-governor-misuse-taxpayer-funds-house-representatives/">8/29/25</a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Rutherford Argued John James Violated House Ethics Rules Prohibiting The Use Of Official Resources For Campaign Activities.</strong> According to the Michigan Independent, “Rutherford argues the use of campaign material at an event involving congressional resources violates a rule in the House Ethics manual, which states, ‘Official resources of the House must, as a general rule, be used for the performance of official business of the House, and hence those resources may not be used for campaign or political purposes.’” [Michigan Independent, <a href="https://michiganindependent.com/politics/ethics-complaint-john-james-campaign-governor-misuse-taxpayer-funds-house-representatives/">8/29/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Election Attorney Mark Brewer Said John James’ Conduct Was "Illegally And Unethically Using Federal Government Resources For Campaign Purposes."</strong> According to Michigan Advance, “Michigan election attorney Mark Brewer, former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, told the Democratic Governors Association that the violation was not complicated to understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘[John James] was illegally and unethically using federal government resources for campaign purposes in support of his run for governor of Michigan. It’s as simple as that,’ Brewer said.” [Michigan Advance, <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/briefs/john-james-faces-mounting-pressure-over-alleged-misuse-of-government-resources-to-promote-campaign/">8/26/25</a>]</li>

John James also wrote a letter to the U.S. House Clerk’s office saying there had been no impropriety, and no impropriety had occurred, and that he was taking aggressive action to ensure these errors did not occur in the future, according to the Detroit News. He also wrote that he had filed his 2023 financial disclosure late due to ‘prioritizing integrity and transparency above haste in correcting these newly uncovered errors.’” [Michigan Advance, <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/briefs/watchdog-group-files-complaint-against-u-s-rep-john-james-for-late-stock-disclosure/">9/25/24</a>]</p>
