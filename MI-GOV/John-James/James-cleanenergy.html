<h3>John James Voted To Cut Clean Energy Tax Credits That Supported Michigan Jobs&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>&nbsp;John James Voted For The “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Which Cut Inflation Reduction Act Clean Energy Tax Credits And Made It Harder For Projects To Qualify For Clean Energy Tax Credits</h4>
<p><strong>July 2025: John James Voted For The Senate FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill, The “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Which Extended $4 Trillion In Expiring Tax Cuts, Added New Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025, John James voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, the “motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214. The bill was ultimately signed into law.

  <li><strong>The Republican Reconciliation Bill Restricted The Ability Of Projects To Qualify For Certain Clean Energy Tax Credits And Repealed Electric Vehicle Tax Credits. </strong>According to Utility Dive, "The bill restricts the ability of projects to qualify for the tech-neutral clean electricity 45Y production tax credit and 48E investment tax credit, shortens the timeline for those credits, and ends the 25D residential solar credit after this year. The 25E, 30D, 30C and 45W electric vehicle credits will terminate after Sept. 30. While clean energy advocates and congressional Democrats maintain that the final version of the bill goes too far in slashing IRA credits, some Republicans wanted to see more significant cuts."

  <li><strong>The Final Republican Reconciliation Bill Allowed Projects To Avoid A Requirement That They Be In Service By 2027 To Qualify For Certain Credits If They Began Construction Within A Year Of The Bill Being Signed.&nbsp;</strong>According to Utility Dive, "Before the House Freedom Caucus reached an agreement with House leadership to vote in favor of the bill, the caucus circulated a memo that criticized the Senate’s version of the bill for offering an exemption from the House’s onerous requirement that clean energy projects be placed in service by 2027 to qualify for the 45Y and 48E credits. The Senate version allows projects to avoid this requirement if they begin construction within a year after the bill is signed into law."

<h4>May 2025: John James Voted For The House Republican Budget Bill, Which Cut Clean Energy Tax Credits Provided By The Inflation Reduction Act</h4>
<p><strong>May 2025: John James Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Included $3.8 Trillion In Tax Cuts Offset By $1.5 Trillion In Spending Reductions To Programs Like Medicaid And The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</strong> In May 2025, John James voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would provide for approximately $3.8 trillion in net tax cuts and $321 billion in military, border enforcement and judiciary spending, offset by $1.5 trillion in spending reductions, as instructed in the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). It would raise the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion and provide for increased spending on defense and border security, spending cuts on social safety net programs, such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It also includes a mix of tax breaks for businesses and individuals; tax increases on universities and foundations; and a phase-down of clean energy tax credits. […] It would reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by requiring states to shoulder more of the cost, expand work requirements for SNAP, extend programs authorized under the 2018 farm bill, and prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Program. As amended, it would cap state and local tax deductions at $40,000 for households with incomes below $500,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 215 to 214.

  <li><strong>The House Republican Budget Bill Included Cuts To Federal Tax Credits For Wind, Solar, Storage, And Other Clean Energy Projects.</strong> According to Utility Dive, "House Republicans on Thursday morning narrowly passed a sweeping budget bill that guts federal support for wind, solar, storage and other clean energy industries. The bill terminates most technology-neutral clean energy tax credits for projects placed in service after 2028 and those that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill’s passage. It also tightens restrictions on foreign entities’ involvement in projects, creating a ‘truly untenable’ situation for developers, Jefferies analysts said Thursday. Nuclear projects have more time to qualify for the credit."

  <li><strong>One Trade Association CEO Said The Bill Would Weaken Power Systems, Send Shockwaves Through The U.S. Economy, And Kill Tens Of Thousands Of Jobs.</strong> According to Utility Dive, "The House bill ‘abruptly dismantles bipartisan, long-standing tax policy that has catalyzed billions in private investment for affordable, reliable energy while sparking a rebirth of manufacturing across America,’ AEU President and CEO Heather O’Neill said. ‘If enacted as written, this bill will weaken our power system and send shockwaves throughout the U.S. economy by raising electricity prices, killing tens of thousands of jobs and ceding energy dominance to China.’" [Utility Dive,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-gop-budget-worse-than-feared-for-clean-energy-analysts/748862/">5/22/25</a>]</li>

<h4>March 2025: John James Signed A Letter Urging House Republican Leaders Not To Repeal Clean Energy Tax Credits&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>March 2025: John James Signed A Letter Urging House Republican Leadership Not To Repeal Clean Energy Tax Credits In The Reconciliation Process.</strong>&nbsp;According to a letter led by Rep. Andrew Garbarino, "As Members of the House Republican Conference, we write to emphasize the importance of prioritizing energy affordability for American families and keeping on our current path to energy dominance amid efforts to repeal or reform current energy tax credits. We strongly support the Administration’s America First national energy dominance initiative. Continued energy expansion and innovation is necessary to bolster national security, create goodpaying American jobs, and guarantee energy independence. The United States continues to produce energy from a myriad of sources that are cleaner and more efficient than anywhere else in the world. As our conference has long believed, an all-of-the-above energy approach, combined with a robust advanced manufacturing sector, will help support the United States’ position as a global energy leader."&nbsp;[Letter, Rep.

<h3>Since Early 2025, The Trump Administration Blocked Billions In Michigan Clean Energy Investments That Could Have Created Jobs And Strengthened The Power Grid</h3>
<p><strong>February 2025: Trump Administration Froze Or Rescinded $21 Billion In Federal Funding For Michigan Clean Energy Projects, Halting Battery Manufacturing And Grid Upgrades.</strong> According to Michigan Public, “The Trump administration has rescinded or frozen previously approved funds amounting to nearly $21 billion for Michigan clean energy projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government is rescinding some grant funds and freezing other grants, loans, and loan guarantees.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly $400 million for consumer energy rebates and weatherization assistance for Michigan homes is on hold.&nbsp;&nbsp;Money to make the electric grid more resilient to intense storms, amounting to $102 million is frozen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Battery manufacturing for electric vehicles was to get $500 million in federal support, but that has been put on hold.&nbsp;&nbsp;$20 billion dollars in loans or loan guarantees for clean energy projects by Consumers Energy and DTE Energy and others, including the $1.5 billion loan guarantee for reopening the Palisades nuclear plant are being held up.” [Michigan Public via Archive.org, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251208165049/https:/www.michiganpublic.org/environment-climate-change/2025-02-14/21-billion-for-clean-energy-in-michigan-being-rescinded-held-back-or-canceled-by-trump-administration">2/14/25</a>]</p>
