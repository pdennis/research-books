### Delay EPA Standards For Hazardous Air Pollutants For Brick Manufacturing

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Delay The National Standards That The EPA Set For Hazardous Air Pollutants For Brick Manufacturing.** In March 2016, Schweikert voted for a bill that would delay until all judicial reviews are complete the EPA's rule on brick manufacturing. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "delay\[ed\] compliance dates for the Environmental Protection Agency's 2015 rule that set national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants for the manufacturing of brick, structural clay products and clay ceramics. The bill would delay compliance dates until completion of judicial reviews in which legal actions were filed within 60 days of the final rule\'s publication in the Federal Register. The bill also would apply to any final rule that succeeds or changes the 2015 rule." The vote was on the bill. The House passed the bill by a vote of 238 to 163. The Senate has took no substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 109, [3/3/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll109.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/3/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/109?18); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4557](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4557/all-actions)\]
