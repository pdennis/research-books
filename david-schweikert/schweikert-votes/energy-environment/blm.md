# Bureau Of Land Management

### Conservation

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Nullify A 2023 Bureau Of Land Management Conservation And Landscape Health Rule.** In April 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would nullify the Bureau of Land Management\'s proposed 2023 'Conservation and Landscape Health' rule and any final rule derived from it --- including the April 2023 final rule issued by the Biden administration. The final rule would amend how the agency implements conservation programs under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 212 to 202. \[House Vote 165, [4/30/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll165.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/30/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/165?12); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3397](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3397/all-actions)\]

-   **The Rule Stated That Conservation Was A Use Of Public Lands, In Turn Limiting Land Uses Incompatible With Environmental Goals.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Bureau of Land Management on Thursday finalized a rule to put conservation on 'equal footing' with other uses for public lands, including resource extraction, a move that congressional Republicans are vowing to repeal. The agency said the rule will help address threats facing these lands, including climate change. The rule will apply to the land bureau\'s approximately 245 million acres, or about one-tenth of the nation's land mass. It clarifies that conservation is a 'use' under the law governing the administration of BLM lands, which the agency said would allow it to promote conservation activities and limit other land uses that are incompatible with environmental goals." \[Congressional Quarterly, [4/18/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7990828?20)\]

### Superior National Forest

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Allow Mining In The Superior National Forest.** In April 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would rescind the 2023 Bureau of Land Management order that withdrew approximately 225,504 acres of National Forest System land in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota from disposition under mineral and geothermal leasing laws. It would require the Interior and Agriculture departments to complete all necessary environmental and regulatory reviews, including those under the National Environmental Policy Act, for all mine operation plans within the forest. Specifically, it would direct the departments to complete these reviews within 18 months of the bill\'s enactment for plans submitted or resubmitted before the enactment date or within 18 months of a mine plan of operations submission or resubmission in the seven years period after the enactment date. It would require the departments to reissue, on the same terms, each mineral lease, preference right lease and prospecting permit canceled between Jan. 31, 2021 and the date of the bill's enactment. It would prohibit judicial review of these leases and permits." The vote was on passage.
