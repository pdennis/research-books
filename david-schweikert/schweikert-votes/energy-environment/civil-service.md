### Outreach For Permitting And Natural Resources Positions

**2023: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Would Require The National Park Service, Bureau Of Land Management And U.S. Forest Service To Conduct Outreach And Advertise Open Civil Service Positions For Permitting Or Natural Resources.** In March 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against an amendment to the Lower Energy Costs Act, which would "require each local unit of the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service, within one year of enactment, to conduct an outreach plan to advertise open civil service positions in their offices relating to permitting or natural resources, including outreach to local educational and other relevant institutions. It would permit local units to collaborate to produce a joint outreach plan with nearby units." The vote was on the adoption of an amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 323 to 109. \[House Vote 175, [3/30/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll175.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/30/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/175?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 156](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/156/actions?s=a&r=6)\]
