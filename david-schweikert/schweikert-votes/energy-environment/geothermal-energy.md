### Leases

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Increase The Frequency Of Geothermal Leasing.** In November 2019, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill \[that\] would require the Interior Department to increase the frequency of geothermal leasing under the 1970 Geothermal Steam law from at least once every two years to at least once per year. In the event any lease sale is canceled or delayed, the DOI would be required to conduct a replacement sale during the same year. It would require that when conducting a lease sale the department offers all nominated parcels eligible for geothermal development and utilization under the resource management plan in effect for that state. It also would require the department to notify any applicant for a geothermal drilling permit within 30 days of receiving the application as to whether their application is complete or if the department needs any further information. If the application is complete, the DOI would be required to issue a final decision within 30 days of that notification." The House passed the bill by a vote of 244 to 171. \[House Vote 473, [11/19/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll473.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/19/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/473?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1449](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1449/all-actions)\]

### Permits

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Waive Permit Requirements For Geothermal Exploration If The Federal Government Owns Less Than 50 Percent Of The Property.** In November 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would prevent the Interior Department from requiring an operator to obtain a federal drill permit for geothermal exploration and development on state or privately owned land if the federal government holds subsurface rights for less than 50 percent of the subsurface geothermal estate to be accessed and the operator submits a state permit. The bill would specify that any geothermal exploration and production activity carried out under this provision would not be considered a major federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act, would require no additional federal action, and can commence 30 days after the submission of the state permit to the department. It would still require the operator to pay royalties to the federal government. It also would permit the DOI to conduct onsite reviews and inspections to ensure proper accountability. The bill would not apply to actions on Native American lands or resources managed in trust for the benefit of Native American tribes." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 225 to 181. \[House Vote 464, [11/14/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll464.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/14/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/464?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7409](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7409/all-actions)\]
