# Carbon Emissions Tax

### Imposing Taxes And Fees On Carbon Emissions

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Reject The Carbon Tax.** In March 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the concurrent resolution (H Con Res 86) that would express the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to U.S. families and business and is not in the best interest of the country. The measure would also state that a carbon tax would reduce America's global competitiveness and instead encourage development abroad in countries that have not imposed a similar tax." The vote was on passage. The House passed the concurrent resolution by a vote of 222 to 196. \[House Vote 97, [3/21/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll097.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/21/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/97?4); Congressional Actions, H.Con.Res. 86\]

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Block Any Carbon Tax Imposed By Executive Agency Regulations Without Express Congressional Approval.** In August 2013, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "include\[d\] in the definition of major regulations, rules that would provide for the implementation or collection of a carbon tax." The amendment was to the House's version of the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2013, which, according to Congressional Quarterly, would "bar major federal agency rules from being implemented without congressional approval." The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 237 to 176. The underlying bill later passed the House, but the Senate had taken no substantive action on it as of mid-December 2013. \[House Vote 437, [8/2/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll437.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [8/2/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/floorvote-241393000); Congressional Quarterly, [8/2/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4328037); Congressional Quarterly, [8/2/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4327590); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Carbon Tax Would Affect Electricity Production; Industrial, Commercial And Residential Heating; And Transportation.** According to the Center for Climate and Electricity Policy, "A carbon tax is a tax imposed on releases of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is emitted largely through the combustion of fossil fuels used in electricity production; industrial, commercial, and residential heating; and transportation." \[Center for Climate and Electricity Policy, [viewed 11/20/13](http://www.rff.org/centers/climate_and_electricity_policy/pages/carbon_tax_faqs.aspx#Q1)\]

-   **Amendment's Sponsor Said His Amendment Would Block Any Surreptitious Administration Effort To Implement Tax.** According to the Times-Picayune, "But Scalise said the fact that the administration opposes his amendment indicates that it might have other ideas. 'The Obama administration has used every trick in the book to implement its radical agenda through back door regulations,' Scalise said. 'This amendment is necessary to prohibit a carbon tax from being imposed by unelected bureaucrats on behalf of the President without legislative action and oversight." \[Times-Picayune, 8/4/13\]

-   **Opponents Said Congress Would Need To Approve Any Carbon Tax If The Administration Decided It Wanted One.** According to the Times-Picayune, "Democrats said the Obama administration has said it has no plans to seek a carbon tax, and, even if it wanted one, congressional approval would be needed." \[Times-Picayune, 8/4/13\]

-   **Koch Brothers Backed Organization, American For Prosperity, Urged Representatives To Vote Yes And Included The Vote In Their Annual Scorecard.** \[Americans for Prosperity, [113th Congress Scorecard](http://afpscorecard.org/)\]
