### Hydropower Projects

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Authorize The Development Of Non-Federal Hydropower Projects As Part Of The American Energy Solutions For Lower Costs And More American Jobs Act.** In October 2014, Schweikert voted for authorizing the development of non-federal hydropower projects. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation "authorizes the development of non-federal hydropower projects, along with the issuance of leases of power privileges, at Bureau of Reclamation projects constructed under the Water Conservation and Utilization Act --- which would open up 11 bureau facilities to development." The underlying measure was the American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs and More American Jobs Act. The vote was on the bill. The House passed the bill by a vote of 228 to 194; the bill was then sent to the Senate, which did not take any substantive action on it. \[House Vote 515, [9/18/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll515.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/15/14](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4547314/36?9&search=xqwJGnpM); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2/all-actions)\]
