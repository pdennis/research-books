# American Battlefield Preservation

### Civil War Battlefield Preservation

**2013: Schweikert Voted Against Extending The Authorization For The Battlefield Acquisition Grant Program And Expand It To Cover Civil War Battlefields To Allow For Their Conservation.** In April 2013, Schweikert voted against legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "extend the current \$10 million annual authorization for a battlefield acquisition grant program through fiscal 2018. The bill would \[have\] expand\[ed\] the government's authority to preserve Civil War battlefields to allow for the use of conservation easements or purchase to obtain historical sites associated with battles of the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion, passing the bill, by a vote of 283 to 122. The Senate took no substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 91, [4/9/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll091.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/9/13](http://cq.com/vote/2013/H/91?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1033](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1033/all-actions)\]
