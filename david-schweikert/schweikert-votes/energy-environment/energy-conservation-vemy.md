**2025: Schweikert Voted To Disapprove A Rule That Established Energy Conservation Standards For Commercial Refrigeration Equipment.** In March 2025, according to Congressional Quarterly, "the joint resolution that would provide for congressional disapproval of, and nullify, a January 2025 Energy Department final rule that prescribed new and amended energy conservation standards for commercial refrigeration equipment."
