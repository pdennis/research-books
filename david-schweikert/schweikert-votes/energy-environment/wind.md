### Authorizing Lease Sales

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Authorizing Wind Lease Sales On The Shelf Adjacent To U.S. Territories And Against Prohibiting New Wind Or Solar Development Rights On Federal Lands For A Decade With The Exception Of Certain Oil Or Gas Lease Sales.** In August 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against concurring in the Senate amendment to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which would "authorize wind lease sales adjacent to U.S. territories but prohibit new wind or solar development rights on federal lands for 10 years unless the department completes certain oil or gas lease sales." The vote was on a motion to concur. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote 220-207, thus the bill was sent to President Biden for final signage. President Biden signed the bill and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 420, [8/12/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll420.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [8/12/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/420?6); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5376](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/actions)\]

### Funding

**2013: Schweikert Voted Against Funding Department Of Energy Wind Energy Programs.** In July 2013, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "bar\[red\] the Energy Department from using funds in the bill designated for renewable-energy, energy reliability and efficiency activities for wind energy programs." The underlying legislation was an FY 2014 Energy and Water appropriations bill. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 94 to 329. \[House Vote 339, [7/10/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll339.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/10/13](http://cq.com/vote/2013/H/339?7); Congressional Actions, [H.

### Offshore Wind Environmental Review Study

**2023: Schweikert Voted For An Amendment That Would Require A Study On The Sufficiency Of The Environmental Review Process For Offshore Wind Projects, The Impacts On Whales, Fishing, Air Quality, Military Use, And The Sustainability Of Shoreline Beaches, And The Costs Of Offshore Wind Projects.** In March 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for an amendment to the Lower Energy Costs Act, which would "require the Government Accountability Office, within 60 days of enactment, to conduct a study to assess the sufficiency of the environmental review process for offshore wind projects. Among other provisions, it would require the study to consider the impacts of offshore wind projects on whales, fishing, air quality, military use, and the sustainability of shoreline beaches and inlets; the impacts of hurricanes on offshore wind projects; how agencies determine which stakeholders are consulted; and the estimated cost of and who pays for offshore wind projects." The vote was on the adoption of an amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 244 to 189. \[House Vote 179, [3/30/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll179.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/30/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/179?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 166](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/166/actions?s=a&r=2)\]

### Tax Credits For Wind Energy Production

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The House GOP's 2017 Tax Reform Plan Which Significantly Cut Taxes For The Rich And Corporations And Phased Out The Investment Tax Credit For Wind Energy.** In November 2017, Schweikert voted for reconciliation legislation which significantly altered the federal tax code. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill substantially restructures the U.S. tax code to simplify the code and reduce taxes on individuals, corporations and small businesses. For individuals, it consolidates the current seven tax brackets down to four and eliminates or restricts many tax credits and deductions, including by eliminating the deduction for state and local income taxes and limiting the deduction for property taxes to \$10,000 and the interest deduction for a home mortgage to the first \$500,000 worth of a loan. \[...\] On the business side, it reduces the corporate tax from 35% to 20% and establishes a 'territorial' tax system that would exempt most income derived overseas from U.S. corporate taxation. It allows businesses to immediately expense 100% of the cost of assets acquired and placed into service, and for small businesses it raises the Section 179 expensing limit to \$5 million for five years. It also establishes a 25% rate for a portion of pass-through business income that would otherwise have to be paid at the ordinary individual tax level, and for small businesses where an individual would receive less than \$150,000 in pass-through income it taxes the first \$75,000 of that income at a 9% rate." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 227 to 205. President Trump later signed an amended version of the bill into law. \[House Vote 637, [11/16/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll637.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/15/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5217156?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions)\]

-   **Bill Repeals Numerous Energy Tax Credits, Including The Per-Barrel Credit For Crude Oil And Certain Clean Energy Tax Credits.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill makes a number of modifications to tax credits provided for the production of energy, including repeal of the inflation adjustment for the renewable electricity production tax credit for qualified projects placed in service after Nov. 2, 2017, with the credit amount reverting to 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour (from 2.3 cents in 2016), and harmonization of the expiration dates, phase-out schedules and application of the 30% investment tax credit as applied to solar, fuel cell, and small wind energy. That investment tax credit would not be available for properties beginning construction after 2021." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/15/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5217156?4)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Extending The Wind Tax Credit As Part Of The FY 2016 Omnibus.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted against funding the NIH at an increased level. According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill would have "extend\[ed\] the production tax credit for wind energy facilities for which construction began before the end of 2019, as well as election to treat qualified facilities as energy property that is eligible for the investment credit. JCT estimates this extension would cost \$14.5 billion over 10 years." The legislation was, according to Congressional Quarterly, a FY 2016 Omnibus Appropriations bill. The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill with an amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 316 to 113. The legislation was later combined with a tax extender bill. The Senate passed the larger measure and the president signed it. \[House Vote 705, [12/18/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll705.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/18/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/S/339?20); Congressional Quarterly, [12/15/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/705?20); Congressional Quarterly, [12/17/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4809119?25); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2029](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029/all-actions)\]

-   **Measure Phases Out Wind Credit By Reducing The Credit.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "It phases out the credit for wind energy, however, by reducing the credit by 20% for facilities for which construction began in 2017, by 40% for facilities for which construction began in 2018 and by 60% for facilities for which construction began in 2019." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/17/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4809119?25)\]
