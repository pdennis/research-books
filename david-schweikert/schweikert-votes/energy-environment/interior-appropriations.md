-   **The Bill Restricted The EPA From Implementing Various Standards And Fees.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "It would restrict the EPA from taking numerous actions, including finalizing or implementing emissions standards, imposing certain methane fees on oil and gas producers, as well as implementing vehicle fuel standards." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/24/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/399?3)\]

-   **The Bill Required The Department Of The Interior To Resume The Issuance Of Oil And Gas Leases, Prohibited The Cancellation Of Leases, Required The Reinstatement Of Two Mineral Mining Leases In Minnesota, And Prohibited Certain Species From Being Listed As Endangered.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill would require the Interior Department to resume issuing offshore oil and gas leases and prohibit the cancellation of leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. It would require the BLM to reinstate two mineral mining leases in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota and it would prohibit certain species from being designated as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act and require the gray wolf to be delisted." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/24/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/399?3)\]

-   **Overall Funding Was Cut By .2 Percent From The Previous Fiscal Year With The EPA Base Budget Facing A 20% Cut, The Smithsonian A 12% Cut, The National Parks Service A 6% Cut, And The Council On Environmental Quality An 80% Cut.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The base bill would provide about \$38.5 billion for the EPA, most of the Interior Department and a range of environmental and cultural agencies, from the Smithsonian Institution to the National Endowment for the Arts. From a technical accounting standpoint, that\'s a slight trim, about \$72 million, or about 0.2 percent on average, from the current fiscal year\'s comparable level. Some parts of the bill would be cut more deeply than others: EPA\'s base budget would be sliced by 20 percent, the Smithsonian by 12 percent and the National Park Service would take a 6 percent hit. The relatively tiny Council on Environmental Quality would see its funding cut by nearly 80 percent, down to just \$1 million." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/24/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8058720?2)\]

-   **Partisan Amendments Banned The EPA From Implementing Or Allowing Certain Vehicle Standards And Prohibited Funding For The EPA's Justice, Equity, Diversity, And Inclusion Workgroup.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "These included amendments to bar the EPA from implementing its heavy-duty vehicle emissions standards; another that would prohibit funds for the EPA's Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Workgroup; and one that would bar the EPA from allowing California to set more stringent standards for locomotive emissions." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/24/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8058720?2)\]
