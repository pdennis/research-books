The vote was on the amendment. The underlying legislation was the FY 2025 Energy-Water appropriations. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 145 to 274. \[House Vote 366, [7/23/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll366.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/23/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/366?3); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt.1106](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/1106/actions?s=a&r=17); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8997](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8997/all-actions)\]

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Eliminate Funding For The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program.** In July 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "amendment no. 43 that would eliminate all funding (\$18 million) for the Energy Department\'s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program and transfer the savings to the spending reduction account." The vote was on the amendment. The underlying legislation was the FY 2025 Energy-Water appropriations. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 147 to 267. \[House Vote 365, [7/23/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll365.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/23/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/365?3); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt.1105](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/1105/actions?s=a&r=18); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8997](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8997/all-actions)\]

### Authorities

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Transfer The Authority To Approve Gas Imports And Exports From The Department Of Energy To The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.** In February 2024, Schweikert voted for "the bill that would remove the Energy Department\'s role in approving gas imports and exports and instead give that authority to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It also would modify current law to provide FERC the exclusive authority to approve or deny an application for the siting, construction, expansion or operation of any facility to export or import natural gas, not just a liquefied natural gas terminal. It also would require FERC, when determining whether to grant such an application, to deem such exportation or importation to be consistent with the public interest." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 224 to 200. \[House Vote 52, [2/15/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll052.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/15/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/52?11); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7176](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7176/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Came As A Response To President Biden's Pause On Liquefied Natural Gas Exports.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House Republican majority, fighting the Biden administration\'s pause on some liquefied natural gas exports, passed a bill that would cut the Energy Department out of the export review process. The bill passed 224-200 with nine Democrats joining the Republicans. The legislation (HR 7176) sets the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as the sole authority for the siting, construction, expansion or operation of LNG import or export facilities. It would also require the commission to deem the import and export of natural gas to be in the public interest. Those changes would all but eliminate the role for administration officials, handing it to a commission made up of officials from both parties." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/15/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7941545?14)\]

-   **President Biden's Pause On Exports Applied To Non-Free Trade Agreement Countries.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The proposal received renewed attention after the administration's Jan. 26 announcement that it would pause approvals of new export permits to non-free trade agreement countries. During this pause, the Energy Department will review the economic, national security and environment impact of these exports, criteria used to inform whether they are in the public interest." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/15/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7941545?14)\]

-   **The Biden Administration Stated The Bill Put Consumer Interest And Domestic Energy Security At Risk.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Office of Management and Budget voiced its opposition to the bill, but stopped short of promising a veto in a statement of administration policy released Feb. 13. It said the bill would 'eliminate an important check that exports to non-FTA countries will be consistent with U.S. law and policy.' 'The Administration believes that the critical protections current law provides, which this legislation would repeal, should be retained to protect residential and industrial consumers and national and domestic energy security,' the statement said." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/15/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7941545?14)\]

### Energy Conservation Standards

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Prohibit Conservation Standards For Clothes Washers.** In December 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would prohibit the Energy Department from prescribing or enforcing an energy conservation standard for clothes washers unless the standard is technologically feasible, economically justified, unlikely to result in additional net costs for consumers and likely to result in significant conservation of energy." The House passed the bill by a vote of 215 to 200. \[House Vote 497, [12/10/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll497.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/10/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/497?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7673](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/7673/all-actions)\]

**2024: Schweikert Was Absent During A Vote On Overhauling The Energy Department's Procedures For Issuing Energy Efficiency Standards For Appliances.** In May 2024, Schweikert missed a vote on, according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would overhaul the Energy Department\'s procedures for issuing energy efficiency standards with respect to certain home appliances. The bill would allow an individual to petition the DOE to conduct a rulemaking to determine whether such standards for such products should be revoked. It would require the DOE to grant a petition to determine if the standards for a product should be amended or revoked if there is certain evidence, including that such standards result in additional costs to consumers. It would require the DOE, within two years of issuing any final rule for a new or amended energy conservation standard for such a product, to evaluate it to determine whether the standard is technologically feasible and economically justified and whether the regulatory impact analysis for the rule remains accurate. As amended, it would provide that the April 2024 Energy Department final rule titled 'Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Distribution Transformers' would not take effect." The vote was on the passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 212 to 195. \[House Vote 184, [5/7/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll184.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/7/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/184?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 6192](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6192/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Allowed Petitions To Revoke Or Amend Energy Conservation Standards And Required Standards To Be Economically Justified Despite This Language Already Existing In Law.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill (HR 6192) from Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., to be considered under a rule, would amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (PL 94--163) to allow the Energy Department to grant a petition to revoke or amend energy conservation standards if it finds they are not feasible with current technology. It would also require that any standards be economically justified, meaning they are unlikely to raise consumer costs while resulting in 'significant conservation of energy or water.' While this language is in the EPCA, Republicans said it was necessary to reaffirm these requirements due to the Biden administration\'s recent rulemaking." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/7/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8004058?13)\]

**2024: Schweikert Voted Against Maintaining The Energy Department's Procedures For Issuing Energy Efficiency Standards For Appliances.** In May 2024, Schweikert voted against , according to Congressional Quarterly, the "motion to recommit the bill to the House Energy and Commerce Committee." The vote was on the motion to recommit. The underlying bill overhauled the Department Of Energy's procedures relating to energy efficiency standards for appliances. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 202 to 206. \[House Vote 183, [5/7/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll183.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/7/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/183?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 6192](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6192/all-actions)\]

**2024: Schweikert Vted Against A Department Of Energy Rule On Energy Conservation Standards For Distribution Transformers.** In May 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "amendment no. 3 that would provide that the April 2024 Energy Department final rule titled 'Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Distribution Transformers' would not take effect." The vote was on the amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 208 to 199. \[House Vote 182, [5/7/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll182.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/7/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/182?5); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 904](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/904/actions?s=a&r=1); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 6192](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6192/all-actions)\]

### Energy Efficiency And Renewable Energy Programs

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Reduce Funding For The Energy Department's Energy Efficiency And Renewable Energy Programs To Offset An Increase In Funding For The Department's Grid Deployment Account.** In July 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "amendment no. 64 that would increase by \$10 million funding for the Energy Department\'s Grid Deployment account, intended to enhance the security of existing electrical transformers from cyber threats and from physical attacks from individuals. As an offset, it would reduce funding by an equal amount for the Energy Department\'s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs and activities." The vote was on the amendment. The underlying legislation was the FY 2025 Energy-Water appropriations. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 214 to 203. \[House Vote 379, [7/23/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll379.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/23/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/379?3); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt.1122](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/1122/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8997](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8997/all-actions)\]

### Energy Surveys On Crude Oil And Fuel Markets

**2022: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against An Amendment That Required The Energy Information Administration To Conduct Surveys Of Energy Companies On U.S. Crude Oil And Transportation Fuel Markets.** In May 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert effectively voted against the manager's amendment to the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act, which would "require the Energy Department\'s Energy Information Administration to conduct surveys of energy companies to collect information on U.S. crude oil and transportation fuel markets; consistently and promptly publish analyses of survey results; and enter into a data-sharing agreement to promptly share information collected with the Federal Trade Commission. It would authorize such sums as necessary through fiscal 2027 to carry out the survey requirements." The vote was on the adoption of the rule. The House adopted the rule by a vote of 218-202, thus the manager's amendment was automatically adopted. \[House Vote 209, [5/18/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll209.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/18/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/209?9); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7688](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7688/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 1124](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/1124/actions)\]

### Funding

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2023 Omnibus Spending Package, Which Provided \$54 Billion For The Department Of energy And Federal Water Projects.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against concurring with the Senate amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, which would "provide approximately \$25.5 billion for the Agriculture Department and related agencies; \$82.4 billion for the Commerce and Justice departments and science and related agencies; \$797.7 billion for the Defense Department; \$54 billion for the Energy Department and federal water projects; \$27.6 billion for the Treasury Department, federal judiciary and a number of executive agencies; \$60.7 billion for the Homeland Security Department; \$38.9 billion for the Interior Department, EPA and related agencies; \$207.4 billion for the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education departments and related agencies; \$6.9 billion for legislative branch entities; \$154.2 billion for the Veterans Affairs Department, military construction, and related agencies; \$59.7 billion for the State Department and related agencies; and \$87.3 billion for the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development departments and related agencies." The vote was on a motion to concur. The House concurred with the Senate amendment by a vote of 225-201, thus bill was sent to President Biden and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 549, [12/23/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll549.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/23/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/549?2); Congressional Actions, [S.Amdt. 6552](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/117th-congress/senate-amendment/6552/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2617](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617/all-actions)\]

**2018: Schweikert Voted Against The \$1.3 Trillion FY 2018 Omnibus Spending Deal Which Raised Spending By \$138 Billion Over FY 2017 Levels, Including \$34.5 Billion For The Energy Department.** In March 2018, Schweikert voted against the FY 2018 Omnibus spending bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Combined, the spending measures would provide about \$1.3 trillion in discretionary spending, with \$1.2 trillion subject to discretionary spending caps, and \$78.1 billion designated as Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The measure\'s spending levels are consistent with the increased defense and non-defense budget caps set by the two-year budget deal agreed to last month. That agreement increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80 billion and the non-defense cap by \$63 billion. Given that the previous caps were set to reduce overall discretionary spending by \$5 billion, the net increase provided by the omnibus is \$138 billion over the FY 2017 level." The vote was on the motion to concur in the Senate Amendment with an Amendment. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 256 to 167. The Senate later agreed to the legislation, sending it to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 127, [3/22/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll127.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/22/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5287294?5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1625](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1625/all-actions)\]

-   **Bill Appropriated \$34.5 Billion For The Energy Department, A Twelve Percent Increase Over FY 2017.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The agreement provides a total of \$34.5 billion for the Energy Department --- \$3.8 billion (12%) more than FY 2017 funding and \$6.6 billion (24%) more than requested. Almost half the measure's funding for the department is for military nuclear programs (\$14.7 billion), representing a 13% increase over FY 2017 levels. The agreement also largely rejects the president\'s proposed deep cuts to science and applied energy programs, providing a total of \$6.3 billion --- representing a \$868 million (16%) increase from FY 2017 and \$1.8 billion (40%) more than requested." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/22/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5287294?5)\]

-   **Bill Appropriated \$2.3 Billion For The Energy Department's Energy Efficiently And Renewable-Energy Account, Including A \$25 Million Increase For Solar Energy Research.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure provides \$2.3 billion for the Energy Department's energy efficiency and renewable-energy account, \$232 million (11%) more than the FY 2017 total. The account funds research and development of alternative energy sources such as biomass fuels, hydrogen technologies and solar power. Compared to FY 2017, it increases research on solar energy by \$25 million, wind energy by \$2 million, water power by \$21 million and geothermal technologies by \$11 million. It also increases sustainable transportation research (such as vehicle and fuel technologies (including hydrogen and fuel cell technologies) by 10%, and energy efficiency research for building and manufacturing by 10%. The administration proposed substantial cuts to all the programs within the account." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/22/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5287294?5)\]

-   **Amendment's Sponsor Said It Would Reduce Spending In The Bill To FY 2008 Levels, With The Exception Of The Defense-Related Spending In The Bill, Which He Claimed Had Already Been Considered By The House.** According to the Congressional Record, Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC), the amendment's sponsor, said, "I rise this evening to offer an amendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill that would cut spending back to the fiscal year 2008 level. While I appreciate the work of the Appropriations Committee in crafting this important bill that does decrease spending, we must all recognize that a cut of \$50 million is a rounding error here in Washington. My amendment makes an across-the-board cut of 7.48 percent to the bill in order to decrease the amount back to the fiscal year 2008 level. The Congressional Budget Office confirms my amendment would reduce budget authority by \$1.34 billion. Defense accounts are exempt from these savings because this House just addressed defense programs in the National Defense Authorization Act a few months ago." \[Congressional Record, [7/10/14](https://beta.congress.gov/crec/2014/07/10/CREC-2014-07-10-pt1-PgH6066.pdf#page=26)\]

-   **Opponent Highlighted Arbitrariness Of 2008 Spending Level Target, Said Spending Cuts Ought To Be Made By Based On Priorities, As Decided By The Congress.** According to the Congressional Record, House Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee chairman Mike Simpson (R-ID) said, "I guess the first question I would ask is: Why 2008 spending levels? Why not 2006 or 2004 or 2000 or 1998 spending levels, or 1972 or 1900? What we need to do is look at what we are spending now and create savings by deciding what is important and what we ought to be doing and what are those things that we might like to do but we just don\'t have the money to do, and eliminate those programs or reduce the spending in many of those programs, which is what the Appropriations Committee does every day. When these bills come down here, we have had hearings on the different functions of the Federal Government. And believe me, if you or I were to sit down and discuss what the Federal Government ought to be doing, we would agree on a lot. There would be things we would disagree on that I think are essential and things that I would disagree that you would think were essential. We have 435 Members, represent all corners of this country, and a budget is, by its very nature, a compromise in those different opinions on what ought to be funded and what the proper role of government is." \[Congressional Record, [7/10/14](https://beta.congress.gov/crec/2014/07/10/CREC-2014-07-10-pt1-PgH6066.pdf#page=27)\]
