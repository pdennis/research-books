### Expedite Natural Gas Pipelines

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Require FERC To Decide On A Pre-Filed Natural Gas Pipeline Constructing Request Within 12 Months.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted for legislation that would effectively streamline and accelerate the federal permitting process for hydropower projects. According to Congressional Quarterly, "For natural gas pipelines, the bill requires FERC to approve or deny an application for a pipeline construction certificate (known as a certificate of public convenience and necessity) for 'pre-filed' projects within 12 months of receiving a complete application. (Under the current process, FERC strongly recommends to builders that applications for larger projects be conducted through its pre-filing process, under which FERC works with the builder to assemble a completed application for certification that can be processed more efficiently.) Such complete applications must be ready to be processed, as defined by FERC in regulation. Federal agencies responsible for issuing permits in connection with pre-filed projects, meanwhile, must approve or deny the permit within 90 days of when FERC issues a final environmental statement for the project. Under the measure, FERC may extend by 30 days the time period for a federal agency to make a decision if the agency demonstrates that it cannot complete the process in the required 90 days." The underlying legislation was, according to Reuters, "a wide-ranging bill on energy \[...\] that includes a measure to repeal the 40-year-old oil export ban. \[...\] The bill would also speed the permitting of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports and improve the aging power grid." The vote was on passage. The House passed the measure by a vote of 249 to 174. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 672, [12/3/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll672.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/25/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4796643/11?16&search=hkBCc1Kf); Reuters, [12/3/15](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-oilexports-house-idUSKBN0TM2A020151203); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/8/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Increases FERC's Role In The Natural Ga Pipeline Permitting Process; It Requires FERC To Set A Schedule For Review, Including A Deadline.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill includes numerous provisions intended to bolster the construction of natural gas pipeline and hydropower infrastructure in the United States, including by increasing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) authority in reviewing and approving such projects. It also includes provisions to promote the designation of natural gas pipeline corridors across federal lands and to allow pipelines to cross National Park Service lands. It designates the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as the lead agency for reviewing proposals for building or significantly modifying either type of project. In doing so, the agency must identify all agencies considering an aspect of an application and set the schedule for review, including a deadline for a final decision. Cooperating agencies would carry out reviews concurrently, identifying any issues of concern that may delay or prevent an agency from meeting the schedule established by FERC, and defer to FERC on the scope of the environmental review in accordance with applicable federal law." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/25/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4796643/11?16&search=hkBCc1Kf)\]

-   **If The Federal Agency Does Not Reach A Decision By The Deadline, The Permit Is Deemed Approved.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure provides that if a federal agency does not approve or deny the permit within the required time period, the permit is deemed to be approved 30 days later. The bill includes provisions to promote the designation of natural gas pipeline corridors across federal lands and to allow pipelines to cross National Park Service lands, which constitute the text of HR 2295." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/25/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4796643/11?16&search=hkBCc1Kf)\]

-   **Bill Supporters Note That The Bill Streamlines The Permitting Process For Natural Gas Pipeline Projects.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Most critically, they say, the bill streamlines the review process for new natural gas pipelines and allows FERC to set hard deadlines that other agencies involved in the process must adhere to, rather than letting the process bog down for years." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/25/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4796643/11?16&search=hkBCc1Kf)\]

-   **Bill Opponents Claim That The Bill Would Create Arbitrary Deadlines For Review Of Potential Environmental Impacts.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "\[Bill opponents\] say the bill sets arbitrary deadlines that ride roughshod over important environmental regulations meant to protect the public's health, chastising requirements that decisions on pipeline applications be made within relatively short time frames, no matter how complex an application and proposed project may be. This is especially egregious considering that FERC is not required to provide other agencies with information that may be needed to make such decisions. It also undercuts the president's Clean Power Plan and the actions of the Obama administration to address the threat of climate change under the guise of energy reliability by requiring FERC to conduct a 'reliability analysis' of rules that cost over a billion dollars, they say, while other 'reliability' requirements would effectively favor coal-fired and nuclear power plants over renewable-energy sources." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/25/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4796643/11?16&search=hkBCc1Kf)\]

-   **Bill Opponents Claimed That The Bill Ignored Climate Change.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents, mainly Democrats, agree that with the changing landscape of U.S. energy the nation's energy infrastructure should be updated and modernized, but they argue that the bill effectively continues past policies and keeps the nation dependent on fossil fuels, rather than taking advantage of increases of clean, renewable energy. In fact, they say, the bill totally ignores the growing dangers of climate change and the need to move away from fossil fuels and would actually act to increase fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/25/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4796643/11?16&search=hkBCc1Kf)\]

### Export

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Expedite Decisions On Applications On Natural Gas Exportation As Part Of A Bill That Overhauled Federal Energy Policy.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted for legislation that would expedite decisions on natural gas exports. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill requires the Energy Department to expedite decisions on applications to export natural gas (usually in the form of liquefied natural gas, or LNG), setting a deadline for the department to approve or deny an application to within 30 days of the bill's enactment or the close of the application's public comment period, whichever is later. Under the measure, all export applications must publicly disclose the specific nation or nations that would receive the proposed export of LNG." The underlying legislation was, according to Reuters, "a wide-ranging bill on energy \[...\] that includes a measure to repeal the 40-year-old oil export ban. \[...\] The bill would also speed the permitting of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports and improve the aging power grid." The vote was on passage. The House passed the measure by a vote of 249 to 174. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 672, [12/3/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll672.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/25/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4796643/11?16&search=hkBCc1Kf); Reuters, [12/3/15](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-oilexports-house-idUSKBN0TM2A020151203); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/8/all-actions)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Require The Department Of Energy Make A Decision On Pending Applications To Export Liquid Natural Gas Within 30 Days, Or At The End Of An Applications Public Comment, Whichever Is Later.** In January 2015, Schweikert voted for legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] the Energy Department to make a decision on pending applications to export liquefied natural gas within 30 days of the bill's enactment or at the end of the public comment period, whichever is later. Under the bill, applications would have to publicly disclose the countries that would receive the proposed exports. It also would \[have\] authorize\[d\] the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit where the proposed export facility will be located to exercise original and exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action pertaining to such applications. The court would be required to order the Energy Department to approve any applications within 30 days if it finds the agency did not issue a decision by the bill's deadline." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 277 to 133. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 50, [1/28/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll050.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/28/15](http://cq.com/vote/2015/H/50?5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 351](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/351/all-actions)\]

-   **Koch Brothers Backed Organization, American For Prosperity, Urged Representatives To Vote Yes And Included The Vote In Their Annual Scorecard.** \[Americans for Prosperity, [114th Congress Scorecard](http://afpscorecard.org/)\]

**2015: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Barring The Exportation Of Liquefied Natural Gas To Nations That Sponsor Terrorism.** In January 2015, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] the exportation of liquefied natural gas to any nation that is a state sponsor of terrorism and to require that such exports be transported by U.S.-flagged and made vessels." The underlying legislation would have, also according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] the Energy Department to make a decision on pending applications to export liquefied natural gas within 30 days of the bill's enactment or at the end of the public comment period, whichever is later." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 175 to 237. \[House Vote 49, [1/28/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll049.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/28/15](http://cq.com/vote/2015/H/49?4); Congressional Quarterly, [1/28/15](http://cq.com/vote/2015/H/50?5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 351](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/351/all-actions)\]

### Export-Import

### Exports

**2014: Schweikert Voted Against Allowing Oil And Gas Obtained Under A Proposed Expanded Leasing Program To Only Be Exported If Doing So Will Not Increase Gas Or Home Heating Oil Prices.** In June 2014, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would \[have\] require\[d\] that leases issued under the bill include a clause specifying that oil and natural gas produced under the lease may only be exported if the Interior secretary determines that the exports will not increase the price of gasoline or home heating oil for U.S. consumers. It would \[have\] require\[d\] the Interior Department to adhere to timelines for permitting and notify reasons of permit denial only if the applicant agrees not to claim the domestic production activities tax deduction." The underlying bill, according to a separate Congressional Quarterly article, "would establish a five-year program for oil and gas leasing. The bill would double the cap for offshore oil and gas revenue sharing to \$1 billion and require at least 25 percent of eligible federal land be made available each year to lease for oil and gas exploration. Under the bill, the Interior Department would be required to make available for oil and gas exploration and development at least 50 percent of the unleased coastal areas that have the most potential for energy production." The vote was on a motion to recommit the bill to the House Natural Resources Committee, with instructions that it be reported back immediately with the specified amendment. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 177 to 235. \[House Vote 367, [6/26/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll367.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/26/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/367); Congressional Quarterly, [6/26/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/368); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4899](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4899/all-actions)\]

It would \[have\] bar\[red\] authorization if the gas would be exported to any nation that is a state sponsor of terrorism or any nation or corporation that illegally obtains military technology or intellectual property through cyber attacks." The underlying legislation would have, also according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] the Energy Department to expedite decisions on applications to export liquefied natural gas." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 192 to 225. \[House Vote 358, [6/25/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll358.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/25/14](http://cq.com/vote/2014/H/358/?2); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 6](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/6/all-actions)\]

It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555, [10/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll555.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/5/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/555?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Budget Called For Preventing The Government From Issuing Fracking Regulations In A State That Already Had Them.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "This budget proposes opening up new areas of the Outer Continental Shelf for domestic energy production, repealing the ban on energy exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, allowing states to develop resources on federal land within their borders, and stopping the federal government from implementing any hydraulic fracturing regulations in a state that has already issued its own regulations." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed 10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Grant States Authority Over Natural Gas Hydraulic Fracturing In Their State As Part Of The American Energy Solutions For Lower Costs And More American Jobs Act.** In October 2014, Schweikert voted for granting states the authority over natural gas hydraulic fracking as part of the American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs and More American Jobs Act. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "prohibits\[ed\] the Interior Department from enforcing federal rules related to hydraulic fracturing for natural gas in states that have their own fracking oversight rules, and it requires EPA to take certain actions in conducting its study of the impact of fracking on drinking water --- including setting a deadline for release of a final report." The underlying measure was the American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs and More American Jobs Act. The vote was on the bill. The House passed the bill by a vote of 228 to 194; the bill was then sent to the Senate, which did not taken any substantive action on it. \[House Vote 515, [9/18/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll515.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/15/14](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4547314/36?9&search=xqwJGnpM); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2/all-actions)\]

-   **Fracking Is The Process Of Drilling Down Into The Earth, Then A High-Pressure Water Mixture Is Directed At The Rock To Release The Gas.** According to the BBC, "Fracking is the process of drilling down into the earth before a high-pressure water mixture is directed at the rock to release the gas inside. Water, sand and chemicals are injected into the rock at high pressure which allows the gas to flow out to the head of the well. The process is carried out vertically or, more commonly, by drilling horizontally to the rock layer. The process can create new pathways to release gas or can be used to extend existing channels." \[BBC, [6/27/13](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-14432401)\]

-   **National Resources Defense Council: Fracking Harmed Human Health And The Health Of The Environment.** According to the National Resources Defense Council, "The sector's growth is spurred by the use of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in which often-dangerous chemicals are mixed with large quantities of water (or other base fluid) and sand and injected into wells at extremely high pressure. Unconventional development using advanced fracking methods poses threats to water, air, land, and the health of communities. Studies have shown dangerous levels of toxic air pollution near fracking sites; and oil and gas extraction have caused smog in rural areas at levels worse than downtown Los Angeles. Oil and gas production have been linked to increased risk of cancer and birth defects in neighboring areas; as well as to a risk of increased seismic activity. Constant massive truck traffic associated with large-scale development disrupts communities and creates significant hazards. The millions of gallons of water used in fracking operations not only strain water resources, but end up as vast amounts of contaminated wastewater. Fracking has been reported as a suspect in polluted drinking water around the country. And methane \-- a potent climate change pollutant \-- leaks rampantly throughout the extraction, processing, and distribution of oil and gas." \[National Resources Defense Council, [Viewed 10/22/15](http://www.nrdc.org/energy/gasdrilling/)\]

-   **Fracking Allowed For Increased Energy Production In The United States.** According to the National Geographic, "The use of hydraulic fracturing to extract oil and gas from the earth dates back to the 1940s, but only in the past few years has 'fracking' become an energy buzzword, alluding primarily to the shale gas boom in the United States and all of the controversy that has accompanied it. \[...\] In the United States, oil production last year reached its highest level in 14 years, thanks in part to output from North Dakota\'s Bakken Shale, and is expected to keep rising. Natural gas production, already at new highs thanks to shale gas, is expected to grow 44 percent in the U.S. between 2011 and 2040." \[National Geographic, [11/11/13](http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/energy/great-energy-challenge/big-energy-question/how-has-fracking-changed-our-future/)\]

-   **Opponents Of The Bill Argued That The Federal Government Would Be Prevented "Ensuring That Baseline National Safety And Health Standards For Hydraulic Fracturing."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents, primarily Democrats and environmentalists, argue that the bill would prevent the federal government from ensuring that baseline national safety and health standards for hydraulic fracturing are established that could be critical in protecting the public and its drinking water. The bill would halt the Interior Department's deliberative, public rule-making process before it is completed, they say, even though environmental regulators and the industry have failed to ensure that fracking is safe and the chemicals and other fluids used won't adversely affect the nation's water resources. They say the public strongly supports such federal efforts, noting that 1.2 million of the 1.3 million public comments received on the proposed rules support increased federal oversight." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/18/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4379170/8?22)\]

-   **Opponents Of The Bill Argued That Each State's Fracking Rules Varied Widely And Did "Not Provide Assurances That A Standard Set Of Protections Exist On The More Than 750 Million Acres Of Land Containing Federal Minerals."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "They note that while many states have enacted their own fracking rules, that patchwork of state rules varies widely and does not provide assurances that a standard set of protections exist on the more than 750 million acres of land containing federal minerals. Under the bill, state rules would pre-empt federal rules even if the state rules were a mere sentence long, and because it applies to 'all activities related to' fracking, this overly broad pre-emption could effectively eliminate federal regulations on 90% of the drilling activity in the United States since 90% of the nation's wells involve some fracking. Federal rules will simply provide a nationwide 'floor' of health and safety standards, they say, and would not interfere with more stringent state standards since drillers operating on federal lands already must also adhere to all state and local laws." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/18/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4379170/8?22)\]

-   **Supporters Of The Bill Insisted That State Regulations Of Hydraulic Fracturing Took A State's "Unique Geography And Energy Production" Into Consideration In Comparison To "A One-Size-Fits-All Federal Approach."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Supporters, including Republicans and the oil and gas industry, argue that existing state regulation of hydraulic fracturing has worked well and that federal regulation is unnecessary and would increase costs and significantly hinder further oil and gas development. A one-size-fits-all federal approach to fracking regulation will not work and would be difficult to implement across the country, they say, noting that each state has carefully devised state-specific rules for energy production that take into account the state's unique geography and energy production considerations. Burdensome federal fracking rules will simply increase the costs of production, they contend, with some estimating that the Interior Department's proposed rules would cost the industry almost \$254,000 per well." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/18/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4379170/8?22)\]

-   **Supporters Of The Bill Insisted That Sufficient State And Local Laws Addressed The Concerns And Protections Required Before Oil And Gas Was Extracted.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "They argue that additional regulation in this area is unnecessary given that federal, state and local laws already address every aspect of oil and gas exploration and production --- including well design, location, water and waste management and disposal, air emissions, wildlife protection, surface impact, and health and safety. In addition, the industry has created a number of guidance documents and other initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing, including recommended best practices for extracting shale oil and gas. As a result, they say, there have been no confirmed reports of groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing. Many states have benefited greatly from the increase in fracking; imposing new federal rules would slow and greatly reduce energy development, job creation and economic development in those states." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/18/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4379170/8?22)\]

### Permits

**2014: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Preventing Expedited Permitting For Corporations That Release Toxic Air Pollutants Within Five Miles Of A School And Require That Oil And Natural Gases Derived From Certain New Leases Should Not Be Exported To Certain Enemies.** September 2014, Schweikert effectively voted against preventing expedited permitting for corporations that release toxic air pollutants within five miles of a school and require that oil and natural gases derived from certain new leases should not be exported to certain enemies. According to Congressional Quarterly, the motion to recommit would have "require\[d\] the establishment of a Treasury Department account for \$10 million per year of revenues generated from the bill to be used by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It also would require that any lease issued under the bill specify that natural gas products cannot be exported to any nation or organization that provides support to terrorists or steals American military technology." In addition, according to a floor speech by Rep. Brad Schneider (D-IL), "This amendment would seek to limit the release of toxic air pollutants around schools, hospitals, and nursing homes from the massive storage of petroleum coke in populated areas." The underlying legislation was the American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs and More American Jobs Act. The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 193 to 222. \[House Vote 514, [9/18/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll514.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/18/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/h/514?10); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2/all-actions); Congressional Record, [9/18/14](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2014/09/18/CREC-2014-09-18-pt1-PgH7819-2.pdf#page=35.)\]

### Pipeline

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Remove The Need For Presidential Approval For Future Pipeline Projects That Cross The Mexican Or Canadian Border.** In June 2014, Schweikert voted for legislation that would require many future oil and gas pipelines that cross international borders to be reviewed by the Secretary of State or Energy within 120 days. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "require\[d\] future oil and gas pipeline projects and power lines that cross international borders to be reviewed by the State or Energy secretary within 120 days of the environmental review, unless the agency finds the project is not in the public interest of the United States. It would \[have\] eliminate\[d\] the current system created by executive orders under which a presidential permit must be issued." The vote was on passage. The House adopted the legislation by a vote of 238 to 173. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 354, [6/24/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll354.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/24/14](http://cq.com/vote/2014/H/354?1); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3301](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3301/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Was In Response To The Ongoing Uncertainty Over President Obama's Decision On The Keystone XL Pipeline.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The legislation was drafted in response to a dispute over the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which has been awaiting a decision by President Barack Obama . Although the Keystone pipeline would not qualify for expedited approval under the measure, some Democrats worried that the project developers would just reapply at a later date." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/24/14](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4503085?121)\]

### Pipelines

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Expedite The Permitting Process For Natural Gas Pipelines.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "remove\[d\] the bill's changes to the permitting process of pipelines." The underlying legislation was H.R. 8, an energy security and infrastructure bill. The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 179 to 244. \[House Vote 657, [12/2/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll657.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/2/15](http://cq.com/vote/2015/H/657?1); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Rep. Paul Tonko (D-NY): Underlying Bill's Provision Is A Solution In Search Of A Problem; Real Goal Is To Expedite The Permitting Process.** In a floor speech, Rep. Tonko said, "Mr. Chairman, my amendment simply strikes section 1101 of the underlying bill. The section is a solution in search of a problem. The section's purported goal is to reinforce the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's role as the lead agency for siting interstate natural gas pipelines; however, I do not think there is any doubt over FERC's role in pipeline siting approval. In reality, this section is designed to further expedite permitting for natural gas pipelines. But there is very little evidence that this process needs expediting, which ultimately would restrict States and other Federal agencies' ability to review projects and the public's ability to comment on them." \[Congressional Record, [12/2/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8894-2)\]

-   **Rep. Paul Tonko (D-NY): Proper Scrutiny Is Needed Due To Safety Concerns.** In a floor speech, Rep. Tonko said, "We are building new pipelines. There is no problem that needs fixing. So what evidence is there that the certification process needs to be further tilted in favor of pipeline companies at the expense of environmental review and public comment? I would say there isn't any. Yet, Mr. Chairman, this section would require FERC to decide on a pipeline application within 90 days after the Commission issues its final environmental document, regardless of the complexity of the application. It would also allow FERC to consider environmental data collected by aerial or other remote surveys instead of onsite inspections. This would enable pipeline companies to circumvent property owners' rights when surveying land, all in hopes of speeding up projects. The siting of natural gas pipelines is complicated and can be controversial. I know this well since there are a number of projects currently being developed in or near the district I represent. I hear from my constituents about these projects regularly. They are very concerned, and they feel like they are being left out of this process. They are concerned about the safety and about the noise, air, and water pollution from the construction and operation of the pipeline's associated facilities. The pipeline companies do not have a problem. The public does. We know that these types of projects, no matter how beneficial to the public interest, can be controversial. Someone is always unhappy about the selected route or placement of these facilities. But we need to do a better job of bringing the public along, and these provisions do the opposite. \[Congressional Record, [12/2/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8894-2)\]

-   **Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI): Demand For Natural Gas Is Growing And The Pipeline Permitting Process Is Too Complex.** In a floor speech, Rep. Upton said, "As we all know, the demand for natural gas is growing, which requires new and modernized pipeline infrastructure. It has got to happen. Unfortunately, the permitting process is becoming increasingly complex and challenging. Rate hikes hit the families and businesses that can least afford it the hardest, the most vulnerable. So we have worked very diligently to find some agreement on this provision. We have held hearings, received technical assistance from FERC, and accepted many of their recommendations. Section 1101 would authorize concurrent permitting reviews, require more transparency through the process, and allow for the use of new survey technology for citing pipelines." \[Congressional Record, [12/2/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8894-2)\]

### Prohibiting Instantaneous, Non-Condensed Gas Water Heaters

**2025: Schweikert Voted To Disapprove A Rule That Would Have Prohibited The Sale Of New Instantaneous, Non-Condensing Gas-Fired Water Heaters.** In February 2025, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the joint resolution that would nullify the Department of Energy's final rule issued on Dec. 26, 2024, that set new standards for instantaneous gas-fired water heaters and set to take effect on Dec. 26, 2029. The DOE rule would essentially prohibit the sale of new instantaneous, non-condensing gas-fired water heaters, but would allow for the sale and use of other instantaneous water heaters." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 221 to 198. \[House Vote 53, [2/27/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll053.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/27/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/53?4); Congressional Actions, [H.J.

The vote was on the adoption of an amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 251 to 181. \[House Vote 171, [3/29/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll171.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/29/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/171?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 142](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/142/actions?s=a&r=10)\]

### Regulation

**2015: Schweikert Voted For Banning The Federal Government From Implementing Regulations Related To Hydraulic Fracking In A State That Has Already Issues Regulations As Part Of The FY 2016 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted for banning the federal government from issuing regulations on fracking in states that have already issued regulations on it. According to the Republican Study Committee, "This budget proposes opening up new areas of the Outer Continental Shelf for domestic energy production, repealing the ban on energy exploration in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, allowing states to develop resources on federal land within their borders, and stopping the federal government from implementing any hydraulic fracturing regulations in a state that has already issued its own regulations." The underlying budget resolution would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] for \$2.804 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2016, not including off-budget accounts. The substitute would call for reducing spending by \$7.1 trillion over 10 years compared to the Congressional Budget Office baseline." The vote was on the substitute amendment to a Budget Resolution. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 132 to 294. \[House Vote 138, [3/25/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll138.xml); Republican Study Committee, [FY 2016 Budget](http://rsc.flores.house.gov/files/Initiatives/rsc-budget.pdf); Congressional Quarterly, [3/25/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/138?23); Congress.gov, [H.

-   **The Rule Requires That Oil And Gas Producers Use The Most Current Technology And Process To Cut Flaring In Half, Inspect Their Operations For Leaks And Limit Venting From Storage Tanks.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "As part of Obama's climate plan, the Interior Department sought to reduce the release of natural gas into the atmosphere from oil and gas operations on public and Indian lands by updating existing regulations on venting, flaring and leaks of natural gas. \[...\] The final rule, which was issued Nov. 18, 2016, requires oil and gas producers to use currently available technologies and processes to cut flaring in half at oil wells on public and tribal lands. Operators must also periodically inspect their operations for leaks and replace outdated pieces of equipment that vent large quantities of gas into the air. It also requires operators to limit venting from storage tanks, use best practices to limit gas losses when removing liquids from wells and restores the government\'s flexibility to set royalty rates at or above 12.5% of the value of production." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/27/17](file://americanbridge.local/fileservices/Users/TZubatkin/Desktop/Opponents%20of%20the%20resolution,%20mainly%20Democrats,%20say%20that%20even%20though%20the%20United%20States%20is%20the%20largest%20producer%20of%20natural%20gas%20in%20the%20world,%20Americans%20have%20not%20benefited%20from%20the%20full%20potential%20of%20this%20energy%20resource%20because%20of%20venting,%20flaring%20and%20leaks%20of%20significant%20quantities%20of%20gas%20during%20the%20production%20process.%20They%20say%20that%20enough%20natural%20gas%20was%20lost%20between%202009%20and%202015%20to%20serve%20more%20than%206%20million%20households%20a%20year,%20which,%20according%20to%20the%20Government%20Accountability%20Office%20(GAO),%20means%20states,%20tribes%20and%20federal%20taxpayers%20lose%20millions%20of%20dollars%20annually%20in%20royalty%20revenue%20due%20the%20federal%20government%20and%20the%20states%20that%20share%20it.%20The%20rule%20is%20an%20important%20step%20in%20both%20protecting%20the%20environment%20and%20in%20reducing%20associated%20problems%20caused%20by%20global%20warming.)\]

-   **Democrat Supporters Of The Rule Note That Enough Natural Gas Was Lost Between 2009 And 2015 To Serve More Than Six Million Households, Costing Taxpayers Millions In Royalty Revenue.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents of the resolution, mainly Democrats, say that even though the United States is the largest producer of natural gas in the world, Americans have not benefited from the full potential of this energy resource because of venting, flaring and leaks of significant quantities of gas during the production process. They say that enough natural gas was lost between 2009 and 2015 to serve more than 6 million households a year, which, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), means states, tribes and federal taxpayers lose millions of dollars annually in royalty revenue due the federal government and the states that share it.

-   **Hydrogen Sulfide Is A Colorless, But Hazardous Gas, That Emits A 'Rotten Egg' Scent; It Occurs Naturally In Crude Petroleum And Natural Gas.** According to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, "Hydrogen sulfide is a colorless, flammable, extremely hazardous gas with a 'rotten egg' smell. It occurs naturally in crude petroleum and natural gas, and can be produced by the breakdown of organic matter and human/ animal wastes (e.g., sewage). It is heavier than air and can collect in low-lying and enclosed, poorly ventilated areas such as basements, manholes, sewer lines and underground telephone/electrical vaults." \[OSHA, [Accessed 7/11/16](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/hydrogen_sulfide.html)\]

-   **At High Concentrations, Death Can Occur Within A Few Breaths.** According to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, "Health effects vary with how long, and at what level, you are exposed. Asthmatics may be at greater risk. Low concentrations -- irritation of eyes, nose, throat, or respiratory system; effects can be delayed. Moderate concentrations -- more severe eye and respiratory effects, headache, dizziness, nausea, coughing, vomiting and difficulty breathing. High concentrations -- shock, convulsions, unable to breathe, coma, death; effects can be extremely rapid (within a few breaths)." \[OSHA, [Accessed 7/11/16](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/hydrogen_sulfide.html)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted Against Requiring The EPA To List Hydrogen Sulfide As A Hazardous Air Pollutant.** In June 2016, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] the EPA to issue a rule that would add hydrogen sulfide to the list of hazardous air pollutants."

-   **Hydrogen Sulfide Is A Colorless, But Hazardous Gas, That Emits A 'Rotten Egg' Scent; It Occurs Naturally In Crude Petroleum And Natural Gas.** According to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, "Hydrogen sulfide is a colorless, flammable, extremely hazardous gas with a 'rotten egg' smell. It occurs naturally in crude petroleum and natural gas, and can be produced by the breakdown of organic matter and human/ animal wastes (e.g., sewage). It is heavier than air and can collect in low-lying and enclosed, poorly ventilated areas such as basements, manholes, sewer lines and underground telephone/electrical vaults." \[OSHA, [Accessed 7/11/16](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/hydrogen_sulfide.html)\]

-   **At High Concentrations, Death Can Occur Within A Few Breaths.** According to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, "Health effects vary with how long, and at what level, you are exposed. Asthmatics may be at greater risk. Low concentrations -- irritation of eyes, nose, throat, or respiratory system; effects can be delayed. Moderate concentrations -- more severe eye and respiratory effects, headache, dizziness, nausea, coughing, vomiting and difficulty breathing. High concentrations -- shock, convulsions, unable to breathe, coma, death; effects can be extremely rapid (within a few breaths)." \[OSHA, [Accessed 7/11/16](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/hydrogen_sulfide.html)\]

### Tax Breaks

**2014: Schweikert Voted Against Requiring Oil And Gas Permit Applicants To Forgo The Domestic Production Activities Tax Break In Order To Take Advantage Of Expedited Permitting Procedures.** In June 2014, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would \[have\] require\[d\] that leases issued under the bill include a clause specifying that oil and natural gas produced under the lease may only be exported if the Interior secretary determines that the exports will not increase the price of gasoline or home heating oil for U.S. consumers. It would \[have\] require\[d\] the Interior Department to adhere to timelines for permitting and notify reasons of permit denial only if the applicant agrees not to claim the domestic production activities tax deduction." The underlying bill, according to a separate Congressional Quarterly article, "would establish a five-year program for oil and gas leasing. The bill would double the cap for offshore oil and gas revenue sharing to \$1 billion and require at least 25 percent of eligible federal land be made available each year to lease for oil and gas exploration. Under the bill, the Interior Department would be required to make available for oil and gas exploration and development at least 50 percent of the unleased coastal areas that have the most potential for energy production." The vote was on a motion to recommit the bill to the House Natural Resources Committee, with instructions that it be reported back immediately with the specified amendment. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 177 to 235. \[House Vote 367, [6/26/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll367.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/26/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/367); Congressional Quarterly, [6/26/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/368); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4899](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4899/all-actions)\]
