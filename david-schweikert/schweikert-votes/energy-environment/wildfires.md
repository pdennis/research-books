### Forecasting

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Improve Forecasting And Detection Of Weather And Environmental Conditions That Can Start Or Affect Wildfires.** In April 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would direct the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to establish a program that would improve the forecasting, detection and monitoring of weather and environmental conditions that can start and affect the behavior of wildfires. The program also would improve the delivery of forecast products to federal and state agencies, local emergency managers and any other relevant stakeholders. The bill would include potential hiring authorities to overcome workforce and training challenges for meteorologists to assist with wildfire forecasting and monitoring. The bill would require the National Institute of Standards and Technology to research methods for improving communications systems used by firefighters, land management agencies and other emergency responders. The bill also would authorize \$5 million for fiscal 2025 to establish a fire weather forecasting and detection program." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 341 to 48. \[House Vote 153, [4/29/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll153.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/29/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/153?43); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4866](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4866/all-actions)\]
