# Electric Grid

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Bolstering The Security And Reliability Of The Nation's Electric Grid As Part Of A Five Year Surface Transportation Reauthorization.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted against bolstering the nation's electric grid as part of a five year surface transportation reauthorization. According to Congressional Quarterly, the conference report would have "require\[d\] the Energy Department to issue emergency measures to address the security of the nation's electric grid in order to protect the reliability of the bulk-power system or of defense-critical electric infrastructure during a presidentially issued grid security emergency. It also \[would have\] require\[d\] the department to improve communication and coordination between the department's energy response team, federal partners, state and local governments and the oil and gas industry to address potential energy supply disruptions. The department must also streamline the process for obtaining temporary regulatory relief during these disruptions to speed up emergency response and recovery." The underlying legislation would have "reauthorize\[d\] federal-aid highway and transit programs for five years, through fiscal 2020, at increased levels." The vote was on the conference report. The House approved the legislation by a vote of 359 to 65. The Senate later passed the legislation and the president later signed the legislation. \[House Vote 673, [12/3/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll673.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/3/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/S/331?0); Congressional Quarterly, [12/3/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4799720?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 22](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/22/all-actions)\]

### Bolstering The Security And Reliability Of The U.S. Electric Grid

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Increase The United States' Electric Grid's Security And Reliability As Part Of A Bill That Overhauled Federal Energy Policy.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted for legislation that was designed to increase the security and reliability of the nation's power grid. According to Congressional Quarterly, "\[The legislation\] also include\[d\] numerous provisions intended to increase the security and reliability of the nation's electrical power grid \[and\] improve\[d\] the ability of electric utilities to clear and trim back trees and other vegetation that come into contact with electric lines on public lands rights of way." The underlying legislation was, according to Reuters, "a wide-ranging bill on energy \[...\] that includes a measure to repeal the 40-year-old oil export ban. \[...\] The bill would also speed the permitting of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports and improve the aging power grid." The vote was on passage. The House passed the measure by a vote of 249 to 174. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 672, [12/3/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll672.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/25/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4796643/11?16&search=hkBCc1Kf); Reuters, [12/3/15](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-oilexports-house-idUSKBN0TM2A020151203); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/8/all-actions)\]

-   **Bill Opponents Claimed That The Bill Ignored Climate Change.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents, mainly Democrats, agree that with the changing landscape of U.S. energy the nation's energy infrastructure should be updated and modernized, but they argue that the bill effectively continues past policies and keeps the nation dependent on fossil fuels, rather than taking advantage of increases of clean, renewable energy. In fact, they say, the bill totally ignores the growing dangers of climate change and the need to move away from fossil fuels and would actually act to increase fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/25/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4796643/11?16&search=hkBCc1Kf)\]

### Resilience Improvement And Vulnerability To Natural Disasters

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Authorizing Several Activities To Improve Electric Grid Resilience And Against Directing The Energy Department To Keep A Map Identifying Critical Electric Grid Infrastructure Vulnerable To Natural Disasters.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the Continental Divide Trail Completion Act, which would "authorize various activities to improve electric grid resilience and direct the Energy Department to maintain a map identifying critical electric grid infrastructure vulnerable to natural disasters to inform federal disaster aid." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 218-199, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 414, [7/29/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll414.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/414?5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5118](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5118/actions)\]
