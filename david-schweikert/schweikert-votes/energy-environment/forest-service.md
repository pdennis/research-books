# Forest Service

### Forest Management

**2025: Schweikert Voted To Identify Fire-Prone Forests, To Establish An Inter-Agency Fireshed Center\] And To Reduce Wildfire Risks.** In January 2025, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would provide for identification of areas that are at high risk for wildfires and expedite hazardous fuel reduction activities in those areas. The measure would grant permanent authority to conduct emergency actions in those designated areas and expand categorical exemptions from environmental reviews for fireshed management activities, as well as limiting legal liability which could hamper government action. The bill would require the U.S. Forest Service and the Interior Department to establish an interagency fireshed center, which would bring together stakeholders to maintain the Forest Service's fireshed registry of wildfire risks nationwide, make decisions on land and fuel reduction management activities and promote coordination and the sharing of data with state and local governments and the private sector. The measure also would establish several initiatives to restore white oak trees and forests and provide for various studies and evaluations, including on the effectiveness of Forest Service wildland firefighting operations and on whether a new federal agency should be established for fighting wildfires on federal lands. As amended, the bill would authorize the Forest Service to approve the removal of hazardous trees or other vegetation near power lines on federal land without requiring a timber sale if certain requirements are met." The House passed the bill by a vote of 279 to 141. \[House Vote 25, [1/23/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll025.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/23/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/25?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 471](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/471/all-actions)\]
