### 2016 Interior Resource Management Planning Rule

**2017: Schweikert Voted To Disapprove A Rule That Changed The Bureau Of Land Management Procedures For Resource Management Plans.** In February 2017, Schweikert voted for a resolution that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "disapproves the Resource Management Planning rule issued by the Interior Department on Dec. 12, 2016 (commonly known as Planning 2.0), which modifies the Bureau of Land Management's process for developing resource management plans for public lands. The measures provides that the rule will have no force or effect." The vote was on the legislation. The House agreed to the legislation by a vote of 234 to 186. The president later signed the legislation into law. The president later signed the legislation into law. \[House Vote 83, [2/7/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll083.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/3/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5034970/9?7); The Hill, [2/7/17](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/318372-house-passes-bill-to-block-obama-land-planning-rule); Congressional Actions, [H. J. Res. 44](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/44/all-actions)\]

-   **The Rule Was An Attempt For The BLM To Address A Wider Variety Of Issues, Including Wildfire Risks And The Appropriate Demand For Renewable Energy Sources; Rule Also Emphasized Using High Quality Data.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The final rule is intended to more readily address a wider variety of issues and possible impacts, including wildfire risk, wildlife habitat, appropriate development or the demand for renewable and non-renewable energy sources. It emphasizes the role of using high-quality information in the planning process, including the best available scientific information, and the importance of evaluating resource, environmental, ecological, social and economic conditions at the outset of planning." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/3/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5034970/9?7)\]

-   **Supporters Of The Rule Argued That The Rule Will Make BLM Provide A More Holistic Approach To Resource Management.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents of the resolution, mainly Democrats, say the rule will provide a more holistic approach to BLM resource management planning and allow the agency to respond to critical environmental, economic and social changes in a timely manner. They praise provisions intended to gather more information at the outset of a project and to work more closely with local communities in an open and transparent manner, saying it will help create more resilient public lands and habitats in the face of climate change. The rule, they say, effectively gives the public a better seat at the table in managing public lands." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/3/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5034970/9?7)\]

-   **Rule Updated Decades Old Guidelines; Because A CRA Prevents Similar Rules In The Future, The Old Rules Would Remain In Place.** According to The Hill, "Conservation groups and most Democrats support the rule, saying it would update decades-old guidelines within the Interior Department and disputing GOP claims that it would diminish input from individuals and local governments.  In a letter to lawmakers on Monday, 13 groups noted that CRA resolutions prevent agencies from writing similar rules in the future, meaning BLM's management policies could be frozen for years. \[...\] 'If Congress wants to return to a system that was plagued with lawsuits, conflict, and the outsized influence of big oil companies then this is the way to go. If they want to maintain a system that allows for both energy development and protecting public lands, then they should keep Planning 2.0.'" \[The Hill, [2/7/17](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/318372-house-passes-bill-to-block-obama-land-planning-rule)\]

### 2019 Lands Bill

**2019: Schweikert Voted For A Federal Lands Bill That Permanently Reauthorized The Land And Water Conservation Fund, Created New National Monuments, Expanded A Number Of National Parks And Added 1.3 Million Acres Of New Wilderness.** In February 2019, Schweikert voted for a landmark federal lands bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, with at least 40 percent of the fund to be used for state projects, at least 40 percent for federal projects, and at least 3 percent toward increasing recreational access to federal lands. It would also reauthorize, through 2023, the national volcano monitoring system and the U.S. Geological Survey. Through 2022, it would reauthorize several programs related to wildlife conservation, invasive species management, and prevention of illegal poaching and trafficking. The bill also includes a number of provisions related to the designation, regulation, exchange, and management of federal public lands and forests. It would make additions and boundary adjustments to several national parks, monuments, and historic sites. It would authorize and establish procedures for the transfer of water and power facilities from the Bureau of Reclamation to state and local entities and would authorize a Reclamation water management project in south-central Washington State. It also contains provisions related to federal land access for hunting and ordering studies on federal land designation, among other provisions." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 363 to 62. The Senate had already agreed to the legislation, thus the bill was sent to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 95, [2/26/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll095.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/26/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/95?14); Congressional Actions, [S. 47](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/47/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Expanded National Parks By 42,000 Acres, The National Trail System By 2,600 Miles, And Added 88,000 Acres To Death Valley National Park.** According to the National Parks Conservation Association, "The bill will expand national parks by more than 42,000 acres, expand the National Trails System by 2,600 miles and add 621 miles into the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Create 1.3 million acres of new designated wilderness, of which approximately 88,000 acres will be managed by the Park Service, as part of Death Valley National Park. \[...\] Establish six new national heritage areas that are managed by the Park Service." \[National Parks Conservation Association, [2/26/19](https://www.npca.org/articles/2120-house-advances-landmark-bill-to-protect-more-than-2-million-acres-of)\]

-   **The Legislation Added National Monuments Such As Medgar And The Myrlie Evers Home National Monument In Mississippi And The Jurassic National Monument In Utah.** According to the AP, "The new monuments are the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Home National Monument in Mississippi; the Mill Springs and Camp Nelson national monuments in Kentucky; the former Saint Francis Dam site in Southern California; and the Jurassic National Monument in Utah." \[AP, [3/12/19](https://www.apnews.com/8adbf18aaf2e4c8cbdfa0cbd8c378b9c)\]

-   **The Legislation Prevented Mining Near Yellowstone National Park And North Cascades National Park.** According to the National Parks Conservation Association, "Prevent new mining operations on 370,000 acres outside of North Cascades and Yellowstone National Parks." \[National Parks Conservation Association, [2/26/19](https://www.npca.org/articles/2120-house-advances-landmark-bill-to-protect-more-than-2-million-acres-of)\]

### Alabama Underwater Forest National Marine Sanctuary

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Designate An Ancient Cypress Forest Off The Gulf Of Mexico As The "Alabama Underwater Forest National Marine Sanctuary" And To Prohibit Dredging Below The Surface And Drilling Or Coring The Seabed.** In July 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would designate the ancient cypress forest in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Alabama as the 'Alabama Underwater Forest National Marine Sanctuary.' It would prohibit the cutting, removing or subsurface salvage of the cypress trees. It would also prohibit activities such as dredging below the surface, drilling or coring the seabed or lowering, laying, positioning or raising any type of seabed cable or cable-laying device. It would provide exemptions for certain activities, such as fishing, diving or similar commercial and recreational activities. It would also provide an exemption for necessary operations of public vessels. It would allow the development or production of oil or gas projects authorized before the bill's enactment." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 349 to 19. \[House Vote 336, [7/8/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll336.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/8/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/336?2); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 897](http://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/897/all-actions)\]

### Allowing The Transfer Of Federal Lands To State And Tribal Groups To Have No Cost From A Budget Scoring Perspective

**2017: Schweikert Voted To Allow The Transfer Of Federal Lands To State And Tribal Groups To Have No Cost From A Budget Scoring Perspective.** In January 2017, Schweikert voted for House rules that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "effectively shield\[ed\] from Congressional Budget Office scoring any legislation that would require or authorize the conveyance of federal land to a state, local government or tribal entity. By not requiring the budget analysis, the affected legislation wouldn\'t need offsets or budgetary pay-fors that can trip up a lands bill before it hits the House floor. According to the provision, land transfers 'shall not be considered as providing new budget authority, decreasing revenues, increasing mandatory spending, or increasing outlays.'" The vote was on the resolution. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 234 to 193. \[House Vote 6, [1/3/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll006.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/3/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-5011968?1&srcpage=news&srcsec=cqn); Congressional Actions, [H. Res. 5](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-resolution/5/all-actions)\]

-   **Federal Land Can Generate Receipts, Including Potential Land Sales.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Federal land can generate receipts from a variety of sources, including natural resources like coal or timber on the land, from activities such as grazing and utility right-of-way fees and from potential land sales from an authorized federal agency." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/3/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-5011968?1&srcpage=news&srcsec=cqn)\]

-   **Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-AZ): "This Proposed Rule Change Would Make It Easier To Implement This Plan By Allowing The Congress To Give Away Every Single Piece Of Property We Own, For Free, And Pretend We Have Lost Nothing Of Any Value."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "House Democrats, led by Natural Resources ranking member Raúl M. Grijalva, D-Ariz., called foul on the proposal, saying it is 'outrageous and absurd' that Congress would give away federal land 'for free.' 'This proposed rule change would make it easier to implement this plan by allowing the Congress to give away every single piece of property we own, for free, and pretend we have lost nothing of any value,' Grijalva said in a statement. 'Not only is this fiscally irresponsible, but it is also a flagrant attack on places and resources valued and beloved by the American people.' Grijalva said local governments are unlikely to have the necessary resources to effectively manage the land, and this type of transfer would lead to state land sales. 'The proposal is one more example of the Trump Republicans' plans to use federal resources to enrich wealthy developers by making it easier for them to get their hands on invaluable federal lands currently owned by, and open to, all Americans,' Grijalva said." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/3/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-5011968?1&srcpage=news&srcsec=cqn)\]

### Allowing Tribes To Have The Right Of First Refusal On Purchasing Federal Lands

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Allow Native American Tribes To Have The Right Of First Refusal On Purchasing Lands.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "allow\[ed\] Indian tribes to have the right of first refusal on purchasing lands. The amendment would require land to be sold at fair market value instead of \$1.25 per acre as under the bill." The underlying bill would have required the Bureau of Land Management to sell current and adjacent landowners about 30,000 acres of federal land along the Red River, which is part of the border between Texas and Oklahoma. The vote was on the amendment. The House accepted the amendment by a vote of 246 to 183. The House later passed the underlying bill, but the Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 684, [12/9/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll684.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/9/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/684?30); Congressional Quarterly, [12/4/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4801178/17?29&search=wjoBOCKF); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 876](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/876/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2130](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2130/all-actions)\]

-   **Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK): Bill Gives Texas And Oklahoma The Power To Conduct A Survey To See What Land BLM Owns Near The Red River And Then Sell It; Tribes That Formally Held The Land Should Be Allowed To Have The Right Of First Refusal.** In a floor speech, Rep. Cole said, "I do, however, still have serious concerns about the unintended consequences that the suggested message for resolving this issue will most certainly have on Indian tribes in my district, specifically the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache. All three tribes oppose the bill and support this amendment. This bill gives Texas and Oklahoma the power to conduct a survey, the goal of which is to ascertain the exact location of the portion of the Red River currently owned by the Bureau of Land Management. The BLM land would be sold off in a three-step process. The first step provides for adverse possessors to apply for a patent to the BLM land. The second is a sale based on a right-of-first-refusal structure. The third provides for any remaining BLM land to be sold via a competitive sale process. The goal is to remove the Federal control that the BLM has over a 116-mile stretch of the river and, by the CBO's estimate, of roughly 30,000 acres. \[..\] Mr. Chairman, the first portion of this amendment is an easy fix. Providing tribal landowners with notice of their right to appeal a survey determination is a fundamental notion of due process. Tribes have been left out of such notice requirements in the bill, as currently drafted. The amendment also alters the right of first refusal structure for landowners to purchase BLM land by competitive sale. Indian tribes that formerly held reservation land in this part of Oklahoma, like the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache, now have the right of first refusal for any competitive sale of BLM land that takes place pursuant to this legislation." \[Congressional Record, [12/9/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9173-1)\]

-   **Rep. Robert Bishop (R-UT): Amendment Alter's The Bill's Right Of First Refusal To Give Some Precedence.** In a floor speech, Rep. Bishop said, "First, the amendment alters the bill's rights of first refusal procedure to give precedence to some above others, whether or not they have a reasonable claim to the land or hold an adjacent allotment. That is the key point right there: is the claim and the allotment adjacent. The bill, as is already written, already gives the right of first refusal to those landowners who are there as long as they own the adjacent land parcel. That should not be changed." \[Congressional Record, [12/9/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/house-section/article/H9173-1)\]

### Authority To Collect, Retain, And Use Fees

**2023: Schweikert Voted To Extend The Authority Of The Shasta-Trinity National Forest Regarding Marina Fees.** In September 2023, Schweikert voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would extend by six years, through fiscal 2029, the authority of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest to collect, retain and use marina fees." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 415 to 0, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 387, [9/13/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll387.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/13/23](http://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/387?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3324](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3324/all-actions)\]

### Bureau Of Land Management's Regulations On Fracking On Federal Lands

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Would Prohibit The Defunding Of The Bureau Of Land Management's Regulations On Fracking On Federal Lands.** In July 2015, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have banned the defunding of the Bureau of Land Management's regulations on fracking on federal land. According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have, "remove\[d\] the bill's prohibition on the Bureau of Land Management from implementing its final rule governing fracking on federal lands." The underlying bill made FY 2016 appropriations for the Department of the Interior, Environment, and other related agencies. The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment 179 to 250. \[House Vote 402, [7/8/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll402.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/8/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/402?1); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 576](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/576/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2822](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2822/text)\]

-   **Fracking Is The Process Of Drilling Down Into The Earth And Then A High-Pressure Water Mixture Is Directed At The Rock To Release The Gas.** According to the BBC, "Fracking is the process of drilling down into the earth before a high-pressure water mixture is directed at the rock to release the gas inside. Water, sand and chemicals are injected into the rock at high pressure which allows the gas to flow out to the head of the well. The process is carried out vertically or, more commonly, by drilling horizontally to the rock layer. The process can create new pathways to release gas or can be used to extend existing channels." \[BBC, [6/27/13](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-14432401)\]

-   **The Underlying Bill Defunded The Rule Entitled "Hydraulic Fracturing On Federal And Indian Lands."** According to Sec. 439 of HR.2822, "None of the funds made available by this or any other Act may be used to implement, administer, or enforce the final rule entitled 'Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands' as published in the Federal Register on March 26, 2015 and March 30, 2015." \[Congress.gov, [HR. 2822\] ](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2822/text)\]

-   **The Department Of The Interior Said The Regulations Supported "Safe And Responsible" Fracking And Would "Protect Public Health."** According to a press release from the Department of the Interior, "Following a robust and transparent public process that included more than 1.5 million public comments, Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell today released final standards that will support safe and responsible hydraulic fracturing on public and American Indian lands. The commonsense standards will improve safety and help protect groundwater by updating requirements for well-bore integrity, wastewater disposal and public disclosure of chemicals. \[...\] 'This rule will protect public health and the environment during and after hydraulic fracturing operations at a modest cost while both respecting the work previously done by the industry, the states and the tribes and promoting the adoption of more protective standards across the country,' said Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management Janice Schneider. 'It will be implemented in the most efficient way possible to avoid duplication or unnecessary activities by industry, other regulators, or BLM staff. We know how important it is to get this right.'" \[Press Release- Department of the Interior, [3/20/15](https://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/interior-department-releases-final-rule-to-support-safe-responsible-hydraulic-fracturing-activities-on-public-and-tribal-lands)\]

-   **The Bureau Of Land Management Issued Rules To Regulate Disclosure Of Chemicals And Disposal Of Wastewater Used In Fracking On Federal Lands.** According to the Wall Street Journal, "The rules, issued by department's Bureau of Land Management in March, apply to oil and gas drilling on federal lands, which produce 11% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. and 5% of the oil, according to government data. \[...\] The rules set stricter standards for disposing of wastewater and disclosing chemicals used in fracking and were slated to go into effect this summer." \[Wall Street Journal, [9/30/15](http://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-court-blocks-obama-administration-hydraulic-fracturing-rule-1443641565)\]

-   **BLM Estimated That Compliance Costs Will Be About \$11,400 Per Well.** According to the National Law Review, "BLM estimates that the compliance cost will be about \$11,400 per well. BLM estimates that on average this equates to approximately 0.13 to 0.21 percent of the cost of drilling a well." \[National Law Review, [3/27/15](http://www.natlawreview.com/article/blm-releases-final-rule-hydraulic-fracturing-federal-lands-industry-immediately-file)\]

-   **National Resources Defense Council: Fracking Harmed Human Health And The Health Of The Environment.** According to the National Resources Defense Council, "The sector's growth is spurred by the use of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in which often-dangerous chemicals are mixed with large quantities of water (or other base fluid) and sand and injected into wells at extremely high pressure. Unconventional development using advanced fracking methods poses threats to water, air, land, and the health of communities. Studies have shown dangerous levels of toxic air pollution near fracking sites; and oil and gas extraction have caused smog in rural areas at levels worse than downtown Los Angeles. Oil and gas production have been linked to increased risk of cancer and birth defects in neighboring areas; as well as to a risk of increased seismic activity. Constant massive truck traffic associated with large-scale development disrupts communities and creates significant hazards. The millions of gallons of water used in fracking operations not only strain water resources, but end up as vast amounts of contaminated wastewater. Fracking has been reported as a suspect in polluted drinking water around the country. And methane \-- a potent climate change pollutant \-- leaks rampantly throughout the extraction, processing, and distribution of oil and gas." \[National Resources Defense Council, [Viewed 10/22/15](http://www.nrdc.org/energy/gasdrilling/)\]

-   **Fracking Allowed For Increased Energy Production In The United States.** According to the National Geographic, "The use of hydraulic fracturing to extract oil and gas from the earth dates back to the 1940s, but only in the past few years has 'fracking' become an energy buzzword, alluding primarily to the shale gas boom in the United States and all of the controversy that has accompanied it. \[...\] In the United States, oil production last year reached its highest level in 14 years, thanks in part to output from North Dakota\'s Bakken Shale, and is expected to keep rising. Natural gas production, already at new highs thanks to shale gas, is expected to grow 44 percent in the U.S. between 2011 and 2040." \[National Geographic, [11/11/13](http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/energy/great-energy-challenge/big-energy-question/how-has-fracking-changed-our-future/)\]

-   **September 2015: Federal Judge Blocked Implementation Of The Rules.** According to the Wall Street Journal, "A federal judge in Wyoming on Wednesday blocked Interior Department rules setting stricter standards for hydraulic fracturing on public lands, the second set of major regulations from the Obama administration to be faulted in court in as many months. U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl issued a preliminary injunction barring implementation of the rules, saying the Interior Department lacked the authority to issue them. \[... \] 'Congress has not authorized or delegated to the BLM authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing and, under our constitutional structure, it is only through congressional action that the BLM can acquire this authority,' the judge wrote." \[Wall Street Journal, [9/30/15](http://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-court-blocks-obama-administration-hydraulic-fracturing-rule-1443641565)\]

The vote was on the adoption of an amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote 214-201. \[House Vote 345, [7/14/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll345.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/14/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/345?10); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 284](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/117th-congress/house-amendment/284/actions?s=a&r=5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7900](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7900/actions)\]

-   **The Colorado Outdoor Recreation And Economy Act Provided For The Conservation Of Specified Lands In Colorado And Designated Several Areas As Federal lands.** According to the Congressional Research Service, "This bill provides for the conservation of specified lands in Colorado. Specifically, the bill designates specified federal lands within the White River National Forest as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System, the proposed Williams Fork Mountains Wilderness as a potential wilderness area, the Tenmile Recreation Management Area, the Porcupine Gulch Wildlife Conservation Area, the Williams Fork Mountains Wildlife Conservation Area, the Camp Hale National Historic Landscape, the Sheep Mountain and Liberty Bell East Special Management Areas, the Curecanti National Recreation Area, and the interpretive site located beside U.S. Route 24 as the Sandy Treat Overlook." \[Congressional Research Service, [1/28/21](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/577)\]

-   **The Colorado Outdoor Recreation And Economy Act Adjusted The Boundaries Of The White River National Forest And The Rocky Mountain National Park Potential Wilderness, And Included More Federal Lands Into The National Wilderness Preservation System.** According to the Congressional Research Service, "The bill adjusts the boundary of the White River National Forest and the Rocky Mountain National Park Potential Wilderness. The bill provides for the inclusion of additional federal lands in the National Wilderness Preservation System." \[Congressional Research Service, [1/28/21](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/577)\]

-   **The Colorado Outdoor Recreation And Economy Act Cancelled The Thompson Divide Oil Or Gas Leases And Established The "Greater Thompson Divide Fugitive Mine Methane Use Pilot Program" To Mitigate Fugitive Methane Emissions And Reduce Emissions And Improve Air Quality.** According to the Congressional Research Service, "The bill provides for the cancellation of all Thompson Divide oil or gas leases. The bill establishes the Greater Thompson Divide Fugitive Coal Mine Methane Use Pilot Program to promote the capture, beneficial use, mitigation, and sequestration of fugitive methane emissions to reduce methane emissions, improve air quality, and improve public safety, among other things." \[Congressional Research Service, [1/28/21](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/577)\]

-   **The Grand Canyon Protection Act Withdraws Over 1 Million Acres Of Federal Lands In Arizona From Entry, Appropriation And Disposal Under Public Land Laws; Location, Entry And Patent Under Mining Laws; And Activities Under Mineral Leasing And Geothermal Laws And Mineral Materials Laws.** According to the Congressional Research Service, "This bill withdraws 1,006,545 acres of federal lands in Arizona, including any land or interest in land acquired by the United States after enactment of this bill, from entry, appropriation, and disposal under the public land laws; location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and operation of the mineral leasing and geothermal leasing laws and mineral materials laws." \[Congressional Research Service, [2/15/21](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1052)\]

### Federal Buildings

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Repeal Energy Performance Standards That Require New Federal Buildings To Use No Fossil Fuels As An Energy Source By 2030 As Part Of A Bill That Overhauled Federal Energy Policy.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted for legislation that repealed the requirement that new federal buildings receive all of their energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "repeal\[ed\] energy efficiency performance standards under current law that require new federal buildings and those undergoing major renovations as of 2030 to be powered entirely through non-fossil-fuel energy sources (i.e., that the building\'s energy source not be fueled by coal or natural gas). That requirement for the energy performance design of federal buildings was enacted in 2007." The underlying legislation was, according to Reuters, "a wide-ranging bill on energy \[...\] that includes a measure to repeal the 40-year-old oil export ban. \[...\] The bill would also speed the permitting of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports and improve the aging power grid." The vote was on passage. The House passed the measure by a vote of 249 to 174. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 672, [12/3/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll672.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/25/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4796643/11?16&search=hkBCc1Kf); Reuters, [12/3/15](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-oilexports-house-idUSKBN0TM2A020151203); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/8/all-actions)\]

-   **The Legislation Also Extended For Two Years The Rule That Federal Buildings Reduce Their Energy Consumption.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "It would, however, extend for two years the requirement that federal building reduce their energy consumption per gross square foot as compared with FY 2003. In FY 2016, this reduction must equal 33%, and in 2017 it must equal 36% of 2003 levels. (The current requirement terminated in FY 2015, with a 30% reduction required.) The Energy Department must analyze the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of extending the energy savings targets to future years." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/25/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4796643/11?16&search=hkBCc1Kf)\]

-   **Bill Opponents Claimed That The Bill Ignored Climate Change.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents, mainly Democrats, agree that with the changing landscape of U.S. energy the nation's energy infrastructure should be updated and modernized, but they argue that the bill effectively continues past policies and keeps the nation dependent on fossil fuels, rather than taking advantage of increases of clean, renewable energy. In fact, they say, the bill totally ignores the growing dangers of climate change and the need to move away from fossil fuels and would actually act to increase fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/25/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4796643/11?16&search=hkBCc1Kf)\]

### Federal Forest Management

**2015: Schweikert Voted For The Resilient Federal Forests Act, Which Reduced The Number Of Forestry Activities Subject To An Environmental Impact Statement.** In July 2015, Schweikert voted for for the Resilient Federal Forests Act to improve wildfire capabilities and forest health on U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands. According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill would have, "The measure provides for expedited actions by federal agencies by expanding the types of forestry activities that can occur without environmental impact statements (such as certain salvage operations and addressing insect and disease infestations) and by accelerating environmental reviews for salvage operations and reforestation activities after catastrophic events. It limits legal challenges to certain agency actions and seeks to discourage litigation by requiring plaintiffs to post a bond to cover the government's legal costs when challenging certain collaborative management activities and by preventing plaintiffs from recovering attorneys' fees if they win." The measure was known as the Resilient Federal Forests Act. The vote was on the measure. The House passed the bill 262 to 167. The bill was received by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and no further action was taken. \[House Vote 428, [7/9/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll428.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/9/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/428?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2647](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2647/all-actions)\]

-   **The Measure Also Modified Federal Forest Management Practices And Seeks To End Funding Through Borrowing For Fire Suppression Purposes.** According to Congressional; Quarterly, "This bill modifies federal forest management practices to increase timber production on U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands as a means of promoting greater forest health and reducing wildfires, and it seeks to end the 'borrowing' of fire prevention funding for fire suppression efforts by providing funding to fight certain catastrophic wildfires from FEMA's disaster relief fund. \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/6/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4718496/7?7&search=GuUomD1b)\]

-   **Over The Past 15 Years, There Has Been An Increase In Catastrophic Wildfires, Which Some Attribute To Decrease In Timber Production.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Over the past 15 years, there has been a significant increase in catastrophic wildfires, which negatively affect watershed health, wildlife habitat, property and human life. Many attribute the increases in catastrophic wildfires to a decrease in timber production from those federal lands; without the winnowing that occurs when large trees are removed, the closely packed trees are more susceptible to fire and their proximity allows flames to spread quickly. Dense forest is also more prone to disease and insect infestation." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/6/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4718496/7?7&search=GuUomD1b)\]

-   **Timber Production Has Decreased Due To Environmental Concerns And Government Funding Shortfalls.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Timber production has decreased for a variety of reasons, including lengthy environmental reviews of commercial logging proposals and lawsuits by environmental groups that target certain forest planning decisions and seek to stop logging projects. Also contributing to the problem has been the diversion of funding away from federal activities that promote forest health and mitigate wildfire risk (such as \"fuel reduction\" efforts) because the Forest Service and Interior Department have been forced to \"borrow\" those funds to battle large wildfires." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/6/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4718496/7?7&search=GuUomD1b)\]

-   **Bill Opponents Claim That The Measure Fails To Protect The Environment And Will Effectively Block Concerned Citizens From Effectively Challenging Rich Corporations.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents of the bill say that it fails to protect the environment because it allows too many exemptions from environmental reviews, permits immediate logging after wildfire disasters, changes the goals of forest management and disregards the right of citizens to confront their government. They say it significantly expands the acreage in which non-reviewed logging activities can occur, including by permitting clear-cutting of forests, which is currently not allowed. They argue that the bill\'s restrictions on legal activities, including the requirement to post bonds when challenging collaborative projects and the ban on recovering attorneys\' fees if plaintiffs win, will block concerned citizens and allow only corporations with deep pockets to make legal challenges." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/6/15\] ](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4718496/7?7&search=GuUomD1b)\]

-   **Statement Of Administration Policy: The Administration Strongly Opposes The Measure Because It Does Not Fully Fix The Fire Budget Problem, Undermines Collaborative Forest Restoration And Environmental Safeguards.** According to a Statement of Administration Policy, "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2647. The most important step Congress can take to increase the pace and scale of forest restoration and management of the national forests and Department of the Interior (DOI) lands is to fix fire suppression funding and provide additional capacity for the Forest Service and DOI to manage the Nation's forests and other public lands. H.R. 2647 falls short of fixing the fire budget problem and contains other provisions that will undermine collaborative forest restoration, environmental safeguards, and public participation across the National Forest System and public lands." \[Statement of Administration Policy, [7/8/15](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/114/saphr2647h_20150708.pdf)\]

### Land Acquisition

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Limit Sandy Relief Funding From Being Used To Purchase Additional Federal Lands.** In January 2013, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to the League of Conservation Voters, "inhibit\[ed\] Hurricane Sandy response efforts by barring the Secretaries of the Interior or Agriculture from using any of the funds in the bill to purchase additional public lands." The underlying bill was Hurricane Sandy relief funding. The vote was on the amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 223 to 198. The final version of the legislation, which became law, included the amendment's policy. \[House Vote 21, [1/15/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll021.xml); League of Conservation Voters, [2013 Scorecard](http://scorecard.lcv.org/roll-call-vote/2013-21-limiting-sandy-response-efforts); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Limiting The Federal Government's Ability To Purchase Land Would Prevent It From Creating New Buffer Zones.** According to the League of Conservation Voters, "Representative Rob Bishop (R-UT) offered an amendment to H.R. 152, the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, which would inhibit Hurricane Sandy response efforts by barring the Secretaries of the Interior or Agriculture from using any of the funds in the bill to purchase additional public lands. This would prohibit federal agencies from acquiring open spaces and natural features that could act as a buffer zone to lessen flooding, reduce wind intensity, and protect communities from future storms. It would also prevent the government from taking certain actions to restore damaged national parks, such as acquiring adjacent lands to create a new trailhead or parking lot if the previous access point was destroyed." \[League of Conservation Voters, [2013 Scorecard](http://scorecard.lcv.org/roll-call-vote/2013-21-limiting-sandy-response-efforts)\]

### Mining

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against Effectively Prohibiting New Mining Or Mineral Production Activities In Colorado By Designating Land As Wilderness For Recreation Management And Conservation.** In October 2019, Schweikert voted against a bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "modify land use authorities for over 400,000 acres of land in Colorado, particularly in areas in or along the Continental Divide, San Juan Mountains, Thompson Divide, and Curecanti National Recreation Area. The bill would effectively prohibit any new mining or mineral production activities on approximately 61,000 acres of federal lands in the San Juan Mountains and approximately 200,000 acres of federal lands within the Thompson Divide. Specifically, it would withdraw the lands from eligibility for activities permitted under federal laws governing public lands, mining, and mineral and geothermal leasing. The bill would designate or expand a number of wildlife conservation, wilderness, recreation and other management areas on federal lands, and it would modify or expand a number of Interior Department land use authorities." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 227-182. \[House Vote 609, [10/31/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll609.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/31/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/609?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R.823](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/823/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+823%22%5D%7d&s=2&r=1)\]

-   **The Bill Expanded Land Use Protection For 400,000 Acres Of Federal Lands in Colorado.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The land protection bill would expand various land use protections for roughly 400,000 acres of federal lands in Colorado, including by prohibiting new mining or mineral development leases, establishing new wilderness areas or expanding existing areas, and designating certain lands for recreation, conservation, and special management." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/26/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/committees-20190626420952?14)\]

-   **Democrats And Republican Disagreed On Whether Or Not There Was A "Local Consensus" To Protect Federal Lands.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Democrats say it represents a locally driven effort among a diverse set of stakeholders with a shared interest in providing long-term protections for key public lands in Colorado. Republicans say it does not reflect a local consensus in the state that is needed for enacting sizable lands bills." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/26/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/committees-20190626420952?14)\]

-   **The White House Threatened To Veto The Bill, Citing Concerns About Its Effects On Local Economies.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The White House also issued a veto threat Monday opposing the Colorado land preservation bill citing concerns about the negative impact the bill would have on local economies." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/26/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/committees-20190626420952?14)\]

-   **Despite Support From Coloradans To Protect Public Lands, Cory Gardner Has Not Supported Wilderness Legislation.** According to The Wilderness Society. "'Coloradans love public lands and want to see more of them protected especially in the face of a changing climate and the nature crisis. Conservationists, ranchers and sportsmen around Colorado will celebrate the vote by the House and turn our attention to the Senate,' said Jim Ramey, TWS' Colorado state director. 'Senator Cory Gardner is the only senator from Colorado in the last half-century who has not sponsored wilderness legislation. As Colorado's only member on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, it's time for Senator Gardner to heed his constituents\' calls and work with Senator Bennet to get the CORE Act across the finish line.'" \[The Wilderness Society, [10/30/19](https://www.wilderness.org/articles/press-release/house-passes-historic-public-lands-protection-bills)\]

-   **The Bill Countered Efforts By The Trump Administration To Boost The Uranium Industry By Mining On Federal Lands.** According to The Hill, "The House passed legislation Wednesday that would ban mining near the Grand Canyon, a move designed to counter any efforts by the Trump administration to bolster the uranium industry by mining on federal lands. The bill \[...\] would make permanent a mining moratorium on more than 1 million acres in northern Arizona surrounding the iconic national park." \[The Hill, [10/30/19](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/468180-house-passes-bill-to-prohibit-mining-near-grand-canyon)\]

-   **Republicans Argued The Bill Would Stifle Economic Opportunities And Called It A "Federal Land Grab".** According to The Hill, "Democrats see the bill as a vital step toward protecting sensitive habitat near the Grand Canyon from the 'imminent threat' of mining. But Republicans argued the bill would stifle economic opportunities for the rural areas of the state \[...\] 'This bill is very cleverly named to make it sound like it\'s safeguarding the Grand Canyon, something I believe we all support,' \[Rep. Bruce\] Westerman said on the House floor Tuesday. 'But when we look at what it does, we quickly see it has very little to do with the Grand Canyon. Instead, it's a federal land grab that would lock up approximately 1 million acres of land in northern Arizona and permanently ban mineral development.'" \[The Hill, [10/30/19](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/468180-house-passes-bill-to-prohibit-mining-near-grand-canyon)\]

-   **NRDC: This Legislation Was "Critical" To Protecting Public Lands.** According to the NRDC, "At a time when the Trump administration is carving up our public lands and auctioning them off to corporate interests who'd destroy them for profit, this legislation is critical.

Like other unchecked powers given to the executive branch, this authority has been abused. President Obama has used the Antiquities Act to remove 533 million additional acres of land and water from productive use, more than any other president.437 Because a national monument designation imposes strict restrictions on land use, the Antiquities Act can hurt local economies that rely on logging, mineral development, energy creation, or recreational activities on the federal land. Further, ever-growing federal land holdings spread the resources to manage those holding too thin, resulting in the neglect and mismanagement of land that often results in destruction of the environments proclamations were intended to protect. Before an area is designated as a national monument, the designation should be approved by an act of Congress." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed 10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]
