### Diesel Emissions Reduction

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against Reauthorizing The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act.** In September 2019, Schweikert voted against a bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "reauthorize \$100 million annually through fiscal 2024 for EPA programs under the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act that provide grants and loans to retrofit diesel vehicles to meet emission standards." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House passed the bill by a vote of 295-114. \[House Vote 516, [9/9/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll516.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/9/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/516?1); Congressional Actions, [H.R.1768](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1768/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+1768%22%5D%7d&s=1&r=1)\]

### Prohibiting The Defense Department From Entering Into Contracts To Purchase Non-Petroleum Based Fuel

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Prohibit The Defense Department From Entering Into Contracts To Purchase Non-Petroleum Based Fuel As Part Of The FY 2016 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted for prohibiting the DoD from purchasing certain biofuels. According to the Republican Study Committee, "Beginning in FY 2016, the Department of Defense should be prohibited from entering into any contract for the procurement or production of any non-petroleum based fuel for use as the same purpose or as a drop-in substitute for petroleum." The underlying budget resolution would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] for \$2.804 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2016, not including off-budget accounts. The substitute would call for reducing spending by \$7.1 trillion over 10 years compared to the Congressional Budget Office baseline." The vote was on the substitute amendment to a Budget Resolution. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 132 to 294. \[House Vote 138, [3/25/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll138.xml); Republican Study Committee, [FY 2016 Budget](http://rsc.flores.house.gov/files/Initiatives/rsc-budget.pdf); Congressional Quarterly, [3/25/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/138?23); Congress.gov, [H.
