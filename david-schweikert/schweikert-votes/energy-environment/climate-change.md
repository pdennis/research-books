-   **Current Federal Goal For New Federal Buildings Is To Achieve A Net-Zero Energy Use By 2030.** In a floor speech, Rep. Donald Beyer (D-VA) said, "H.R. 8, the North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act, deliberately removes the energy usage goals for Federal buildings. In 2007, under the Energy Independence and Security Act, our last energy infrastructure overhaul bill, a provision was included that set a goal for new Federal buildings to have net-zero energy usage by 2030. This naturally also meant the Federal Government would have a corresponding goal of reducing fossil-fuel-generated electricity consumption in its buildings." \[Congressional Record, [12/2/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/house-section/article/H8894-2)\]

**2015: Schweikert Effectively Voted To Limit Mining Permitting Agencies From Assessing Climate Change From A Potential Mine.** In October 2015, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "not limit\[ed\] the authority of the lead permitting agency to assess the proposed activity\'s potential contribution to climate change." The underlying legislation would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "deem\[ed\] mining operations of 'strategic and critical minerals' as 'infrastructure projects' as described in a 2012 presidential order regarding permitting of infrastructure projects. \[...\] The bill would \[have\] require\[d\] the lead agency responsible for issuing mining permits to appoint a project lead to coordinate interagency permitting to minimize delays and set timelines. The bill also would \[have\] deem\[ed\] requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act to have been met if the lead agency determines that any state or federal agency has or will address certain factors specified in the bill, including the environmental impact and public participation." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 184 to 246. \[House Vote 564, [10/22/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll564.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/22/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/564?27); Congressional Quarterly, [10/22/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/565?21); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1937](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1937/all-actions)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Would Allow Federal Agencies To Consider The Social Cost Of Carbon.** In July 2015, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would allow rules to consider the social cost of carbon. According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have "allow\[ed\] rules to consider the social cost of carbon." In addition, according to Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO), the amendment "would strip the bill of a harmful and unrelated restriction that actually would prohibit Federal agencies from assessing the social cost of carbon, meaning Federal agencies would not be able to look at the monetized impact, the actual costs of climate change. They would be forced to deliberately have a blindfold and not be allowed to consider climate change in their planning, just like American businesses do, like States do, like municipalities do, but the Federal Government would be prohibited from even looking at the costs of climate change." The underlying measure was the FY 2016 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment 186 to 243. \[House Vote 400, [7/8/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll400.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/8/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/400?9); Congressional Record, [7/7/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/07/house-section/article/H4783-1); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **2013: Energy Department Set "Social Cost Of Carbon" At \$36 Per Ton.** According to The Washington Post, "The agency is now using a higher figure for the 'social cost of carbon' in calculating the benefits of the rule. Instead of assuming that the harm caused by carbon-dioxide emissions comes to \$22 per ton in 2013, regulators are now using a figure of about \$36 per ton. That's a big shift --- the Obama administration is effectively saying that climate change will be more damaging than previously estimated, in part because of the impacts of future sea-level rise. And that means U.S. government agencies could, in theory, justify even stricter regulations to curb greenhouse-gas emissions." \[Washington Post, [6/5/13](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/05/what-an-obscure-microwave-rule-says-about-obamas-climate-plans/)\]

-   **Cost Of Carbon Was Determined By Scrutinizing Climate Models And Estimating The Future Effects Of Higher Temperatures.** According to The Washington Post, "Back in 2010, 12 different U.S. government agencies got together and tried to estimate how much damage a ton of carbon-dioxide actually caused through global warming. This is a tricky calculation. It entails scrutinizing climate models and estimating the future effects of higher temperatures, and then translating that into present-day dollar terms, which means deciding how much value to place on future generations. When the dust settled, the agencies settled on a central estimate of about \$21 per ton of carbon-dioxide in 2010 --- rising to \$22 by 2013 and continuing upward --- and the value varied if you put more or less weight on future generations." \[Washington Post, [6/5/13](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/05/what-an-obscure-microwave-rule-says-about-obamas-climate-plans/)\]

-   **Rep. Calvert (R-CA) Opposed The Amendment Because The EPA's Approach To Costs Was "Flawed," Added The Social Cost Of Carbon Helped Justify "Larger Benefits From Reducing Carbon Emissions."** According to a floor speech by Rep. Calvert obtained via the Congressional Record, "Madam Chair, I have long been concerned with how EPA conducts its cost-benefit analysis to justify its rulemaking. This is something that the committee has discussed with EPA on a number of occasions, and the Supreme Court recently ruled that EPA\'s approach to examining costs and their regulation was flawed. The administration's revised estimates for the social cost of carbon help justify on paper larger benefits from reducing carbon emissions in any proposed rule. If the administration can inflate the price tag so that the benefits always exceed the costs, the administration can goldplate requirement regulations from any department or any agency." \[Congressional Record, [7/7/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/07/house-section/article/H4783-1)\]

-   **2015: Rep. Lummis (R-WY) Said Obama Administration's Social Cost Of Carbon "Risks American Jobs And Our Nation's Prosperity."** According to Bloomberg BNA, "Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee blasted the Obama administration July 22 for continuing to rely on an estimate of the costs imposed by carbon pollution on human health and other societal costs to justify power plant carbon pollution limits and other climate rules Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) said that while she acknowledges the Earth is warming, she believes the social cost of carbon estimates inflate the benefits of regulations, which in turn only encourages more burdensome regulations by federal agencies. 'The social cost of carbon risks American jobs and our nation's prosperity, all in the name of questionable statistical models,' Lummis said. The White House earlier this month revised the carbon social cost figure---which it first began using in 2009 to reflect the long-term damage done by a ton of carbon pollution---to \$36 a ton." \[Bloomberg BNA, [7/23/15](http://www.bna.com/republicans-fault-36aton-n17179933858/)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Would Remove A Provision That Effectively Lowers The Amount Of Climate Science-Related Initiatives Funded By The Federal Government.** In May 2015, Schweikert voted against removing a provision from a scientific research funding authorization bill that would force the Energy Department's Office of Science to only approve climate science if it was determined that the work was not duplicative. According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have "remove\[d\] a provision in the bill that would require a Government Accountability Office report identifying certain overlapping climate science-related initiatives. It also would \[have\] remove\[d\] a provision that would prohibit the director of the Energy Department's Office of Science from approving new climate science-related initiatives without making a determination that such work is unique and not duplicative of work by other federal agencies.

### Effect Of Climate Change

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Block The Department Of Defense From Assessing Or Reporting On Climate Change.** In May 2014, Schweikert voted for an amendment to the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would bar the use of funds in the bill to conduct climate change assessments and reports." The House agreed to the amendment by a vote of 231 to 192. The House subsequently passed the underlying bill; however, the bill died in the Senate. \[House Vote 231, [5/22/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll231.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/22/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/231); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Amendment's Sponsor Argued That Congress Needed To Prevent Defense Funding From Being Diverted To Fund What He Argued Was The Administration's Ideological Climate Change Crusade Against Carbon.** According to the Congressional Record, Rep. David McKinley (R-WV), the amendment's sponsor, said, "Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit the Department of Defense from spending money on climate change policies forced upon them by the Obama administration. We shouldn't be diverting our financial resources away from the primary missions of our military and our national security in pursuit of an ideology. For example, earlier this year, the President diverted crucial funding on rural sewer and water line grants to promote his climate change initiatives. Let\'s make it clear. I acknowledge that climate change is occurring. The climate has always been changing. The question is whether or not, given the global unrest from these rogue nations and our war on terrorism, whether we should be diverting our funds to support an ideology instead of maximizing our investments in national security. Now, climate change alarmists contend that man-made CO 2 is the cause of climate change. Most people may not realize that 96 percent of all the CO 2 emissions occur naturally, and America's CO 2 emissions\' contribution to the global community is actually less than 1 percent, Mr. Chairman. But even with these facts, decarbonizing America\'s economy is still a long-term goal of the climate alarmists. \[...\] We shouldn\'t be putting our funds for the military and our defense at risk by diverting funds for an ideologically motivated agenda. If this administration truly wishes to address the problem of CO 2 emissions, they should help the rest of the world tackle the deforestation of our tropical rain forests. \[...\] We should not sacrifice our economy and our national security by diverting funds in pursuit of an ideological crusade. This is not the time to divert our financial resources from our military for climate change purposes when we are confronting Syria, Iran, Russia, Libya, and other rogue nations around the world. In addition, we have Boko Haram, Hamas, al Qaeda, and other terrorist groups promoting instability and threatening liberty and freedom around the world. Consequently, this amendment will ensure we maximize our military might without diverting funds for a politically motivated agenda." \[Congressional Record, [5/21/14](https://beta.congress.gov/crec/2014/05/21/CREC-2014-05-21-pt1-PgH4716-3.pdf)\]

-   **Amendment Opponent Argued It Would Force The Defense Department To Ignore Both Science And The Real World Effects, Costs And Threats To National Security Resulting From Climate Change.** According to the Congressional Record, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA) said, "Mr. Chairman, the McKinley amendment provides that the Department of Defense may not make decisions based on science. Imagine, the Department of Defense should not make decisions based on science. They should ignore that there may be a cost from climate change. This amendment waves a magic wand and decrees that climate change imposes no costs at all. Therefore, they would block the Defense Department from recognizing the damage caused by climate change. This is incredible, because the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review called climate change 'an accelerant of instability or conflict' that 'could have significant geopolitical impacts around the world, contributing to poverty, environmental degradation, and the further weakening of fragile governments.' But the McKinley amendment tells the DOD to ignore these impacts. Numerous national security experts with unimpeachable credentials\-- Democrats and Republicans alike -- have warned that climate change threatens our national security. Just this month, a panel of retired three- and four-star generals and admirals released a report calling for action to address this problem. It will be too late for action when they see some of their facilities being overwhelmed by the increase in rising seas or by storms that may destroy some of our defense installations. But according to this amendment, they can't look at that. They can't make decisions based on the science that may come from these governmental and other scientific agencies. Well, I think that is science denial at its worst to say that the Defense Department cannot recognize damage caused by climate change. It looks like it is trying to overturn the laws of nature. So we would tie the hands of the Defense Department and tell them that even though we might have exacerbated heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods, water- and vector-borne diseases, diseases which will pose greater risk to human health and lives around the world, and wheat and corn yields are already experiencing the negative impact and we have a larger risk of food security globally and regionally, if scientists tell us that, we are not allowed to have our Defense Department pay any heed to it." \[Congressional Record, [5/21/14](https://beta.congress.gov/crec/2014/05/21/CREC-2014-05-21-pt1-PgH4716-3.pdf)\]

### Effect Of Climate Change On International Trade

**2015: Schweikert Was Absent During A Vote On Prohibiting Future Trade Deals From Requiring Climate Change Obligations As Part Of A Customs And Trade Enforcement Bill.** In December 2015, Schweikert missed a vote on legislation that modified future U.S. trade objectives to include a requirement that no trade deal could include climate change obligations as part of a customs and trade enforcement bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "amend\[ed\] the Trade Promotion Authority law (PL 114-26) enacted earlier this year to add more negotiating objectives for future trade agreements, including language: \[...\] To ensure that trade agreements 'do not establish obligations for the United States regarding greenhouse gas emissions measures, including obligations that require changes to U.S. laws or regulations or that would affect the implementation of such laws or regulations,' other than those fulfilling other negotiating objectives in TPA." The underlying legislation was a conference report that would have "formally establish\[ed\] the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and authorize\[d\] the CBP to use an automated import-export processing system \[...\] strengthen\[ed\] enforcement of intellectual property rights and \[...\] would \[have\] permanently ban\[ned\] state and local taxation of Internet access and ends grandfathered Internet access taxation in seven states."

According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "amend\[ed\] Trade Promotion Authority within HR 1314, once it is enacted, to add additional trade negotiating objectives, including language on: \[...\] Climate Change --- To ensure that trade agreements 'do not require changes to U.S. law or obligate the United States with respect to global warming or climate change.'" The underlying legislation "formally establish\[ed\] U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in statute \[...\] \[and\] include\[ed\] a number of provisions dealing with enforcement of U.S. trade laws, including U.S. intellectual property rights and anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws." The vote was on a motion to concur with the Senate amendments with an amendment. The House agreed to the amendment by a vote of 240 to 190. The House and Senate later conferenced, and a final version of the bill, with a similar provision, was signed into law. \[House Vote 363, [6/12/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll363.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/11/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4704138?4); Congressional Quarterly, [6/12/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/363?47); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 644](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/644/all-actions)\]
