# Methane Emissions

### Reduction

**2024: Schweikert Voted Against Authorizing The Methane Emission Reduction Program.** In March 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would repeal authorizations for the EPA\'s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund that helps finance clean energy and technology projects as well as the Methane Emission Reduction Program that promotes reductions in methane emissions, both of which were authorized and funded as part of the 2022 climate, health and tax law. It also would rescind any unobligated funds from those programs." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 209 to 204. \[House Vote 104, [3/22/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll104.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/22/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/104?5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1023](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1023/all-actions)\]
