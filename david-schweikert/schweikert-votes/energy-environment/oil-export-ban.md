# Oil Export Ban

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Lift The Ban On Crude Oil Exports.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted for lifting a ban on the crude oil exports. According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill would have "allow\[ed\] the export of crude oil produced in the United States by removing the export ban imposed by the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act, and would prohibit U.S. officials from imposing or enforcing restrictions on U.S. crude oil exports, but would not prevent the president from limiting U.S. crude oil exports in response to foreign threats. As amended, the bill would \[have\] also include\[d\] a report on greenhouse gas emissions and a study on the impact on consumers, would allow the president to ban exports to state sponsors of terrorism, and would ban the sale of U.S.-produced oil to Iran." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 261 to 159. The Senate did not act on the legislation, but the ban was lifting in different legislation. \[House Vote 549, [10/9/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll549.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/9/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll549.xml); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 702](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/702/all-actions); Congressional Quarterly, [10/17/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4809119?21); BBC, [12/18/15](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35136831)\]

-   **Ban Began In 1975 In Response To The Arab Oil Embargo.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The existing ban on the export of U.S. oil was first established in 1975 --- in the wake of the Arab oil embargo, government price controls and efforts by U.S. producers to avoid those price controls by exporting U.S. oil --- with enactment of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (PL 94-163). That law allowed the president, acting through the Commerce Department, to establish rules prohibiting the export of U.S. crude oil. Since then, and in conjunction with other laws since enacted, exports of U.S. crude oil have effectively been banned, although the president may allow certain exports on a case-by-case basis if they are determined to be in the national interest." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/17/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4809119?21)\]

-   **Ban Opponents Say That Lifting The Ban Increases World-Wide Oil Prices And Would Encourage Further U.S. Production.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "They note that with recent increases in production, the United States is now the world\'s second-largest producer of oil and that if U.S. crude could be exported it would help bring down oil prices in world markets, which in turn would help U.S. consumers by reducing gas prices since gas prices are tied primarily to worldwide oil costs. Supporters say the ability to sell on the world market would also encourage further U.S. production, which would directly result in the creation of more good-paying jobs in the oil industry, further boosting the U.S. economy. Exporting U.S. oil would also boost the nation\'s geopolitical standing, they argue, by reducing the dependence of U.S. allies on energy from Russia." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/2/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4766283/15?23)\]

-   **Natural Resources Defense Council: Lifting The Ban Benefits Oil Companies At The Expense Of American Consumers And "Flies In The Face Of Other Action Being Taken To Reduce Oil Use And Attack Climate Change."** According to The Hill, "The Natural Resources Defense Council applauded many provisions of the bill, including the fact that many potential provisions blocking environmental rules were left out. 'The major disappointment in the deal is the lifting of the ban on exporting U.S. crude oil,' said Rhea Suh, the group's president. 'Republican leaders made this one of their top priorities even though it benefits oil companies at the expense of American consumers and refinery workers,' she said. 'The move flies in the face of other actions being taken to reduce oil use and attack climate change.'" \[The Hill, [12/16/15](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/263460-some-dems-greens-object-to-oil-export-allowance)\]
