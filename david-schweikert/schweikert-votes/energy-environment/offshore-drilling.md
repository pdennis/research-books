# Offshore Drilling

### Alaska

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Allow The Issuance Of Oil And Gas Permits In The Bristol Bay, Alaska Area.** In June 2013, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "bar\[red\] the Interior secretary from issuing any oil and gas leases for any area in Bristol Bay off the coast of Alaska. It also would nullify provisions in the bill that provide for revenue sharing with coastal states." The underlying legislation was H.R. 2231, the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act. The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 183 235. \[House Vote 299, [6/28/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll299.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/28/13](http://cq.com/vote/2013/h/299?5); Congressional Actions, [H.

### California

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Increase Offshore Drilling Along The U.S. Coast, Including The Coasts Of California, South Carolina And Virginia.** In June 2013, Schweikert voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, would have "direct\[ed\] the Interior secretary to develop a five-year offshore leasing plan that would make at least 50 percent of the unleased coastal areas with the most potential for energy production available for oil and gas exploration and development. It would \[have\] create\[d\] a nationwide revenue sharing system so coastal states would receive a share of the federal royalties. Drilling would \[have\] be\[en\] allowed off the coasts of California, South Carolina and Virginia." The vote was on passage of the bill, which the House approved by a vote of 235 to 186. The bill died in the Senate. \[House Vote 304, [6/28/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll304.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/28/13](http://cq.com/doc/floorvote-240546000); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2231](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2231/all-actions)\]

-   **Bill Expedited Environmental Reviews And External Challenges To Authorized Projects.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "It also would require the Interior secretary to prepare a multi-sale environmental impact statement in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act for all lease sales authorized by the bill. As amended it would require that claims arising from projects covered by the bill be filed within 60 days and resolved within six months." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/28/13](http://cq.com/doc/floorvote-240546000)\]

-   **Republicans Argued Bill Would Correct Obama's Failure To Expand Leases.** According to The Hill, "In Thursday debate, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings (R-Wash.) said the president had a chance to expand lease sales, but instead put forward a restrictive plan that will hurt U.S. energy development. '\[H\]e went out of his way to shut down this opportunity by putting forth a new five-year offshore leasing plan that locks up 85 percent of our offshore areas,' he said. 'The plan includes no new drilling, which results in no new American jobs.'" \[The Hill, [6/28/13](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/308433-house-votes-to-expand-offshore-oil-and-gas-leases)\]

-   **Democrats Said Energy Companies Currently Had Plenty Of Offshore Drilling Access And That Gas Prices Would Not Be Lowered By The Bill.** According to The Hill, " "Democrats argued that energy companies have access to enough offshore areas right now, and that President Obama's plan has not limited energy production or led to higher gas prices, as Republicans have claimed. '\[T\]he premise that somehow by putting more leases out there --- with no requirement for them to perform --- the price of gas will drop is absolutely untrue,' said Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.). 'We all know that's untrue. The American consumers know it's untrue.'" \[The Hill, [6/28/13](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/308433-house-votes-to-expand-offshore-oil-and-gas-leases)\]

### Oil And Gas Leasing

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against Ending Oil And Gas Leasing In The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Area Of Alaska.** In September 2019, Schweikert voted against a bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "repeal existing law authorizing an Interior Department program for the leasing, development, and transportation of oil and gas in and from the coastal plane of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It would also require the Interior Department to collect inspection fees from certain oil and gas facilities operating on the outer Continental Shelf and set annual levels and schedules for fees collected from facilities above the waterline, drilling rigs, and non-rig units. Such fees would be deposited into a Treasury Department ocean energy safety fund established under the bill\'s provisions, with funds to be made available through annual appropriations acts to carry out inspections of outer Continental Shelf facilities." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 225-193. \[House Vote 530, [9/12/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll530.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/12/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/530?21); Congressional Actions, [H.R.1146](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1146/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+1146%22%5D%7d&s=8&r=1)\]

-   **The Bill Blocked The Trump Administrations Plans To Expand Offshore Drilling, Which Was Opposed By Coastal Lawmakers Who Claimed Offshore Drilling Hurts Their Tourism And Seafood Industries.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Trump administration has proposed adding those areas to its offshore leasing plan as it seeks to expand the country's energy production. Those plans have met with resistance from coastal lawmakers and governors from both parties who fear the damage drilling activity could have on their tourism and seafood industries, as well as marine life. The administration has put its plan on hold, but lawmakers aren\'t taking chances. The mere specter of oily beaches can lead to hundreds of hotel cancellations, the lawmakers contend" \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/11/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5720384?6)\]

-   **In 2018 The Trump Administration Put Forward A Proposal To Expand Offshore Drilling Off The U.S. Pacific And Atlantic Coasts That Has Been Delayed Due To Litigation.** According to the Center for American Progress, "In 2018, the Trump administration put forward a highly controversial plan to expand offshore drilling off the U.S. Pacific and Atlantic coasts, the west coast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, and Alaska. Though this drilling proposal has been delayed as a result of litigation, coastal communities remain deeply concerned that the administration's final decision will irreversibly damage the health of America's coastal and marine environments." \[Center for American Progress, [10/23/19](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/news/2019/10/23/475732/trumps-offshore-drilling-plan-environmental-disaster/)\]

-   **CAP: The Proposal Would Emit An Additional 46 Billion Metric Tons Of Greenhouse Gases, Equivalent To The Yearly Emissions Of 10 Billion Cars And 3 Percent Of What Remains In The Global Carbon Budget.** According to the Center for American Progress, "The data show that if this plan were implemented, the resulting combustion of the additional fossil fuels extracted would add as many as 46 billion metric tons of GHG emissions to the world's atmosphere. That is nearly seven times more than all GHG emitted by the entire United States each year. Put another way, such an increase is the equivalent of the yearly emissions from nearly 10 billion cars---nine times as many cars as are on the road worldwide today \[...\] The 46 billion metric tons of carbon that would be released by Trump's plan would account for more than 3 percent of what remains in the entire global carbon budget." \[Center for American Progress, [10/23/19](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/news/2019/10/23/475732/trumps-offshore-drilling-plan-environmental-disaster/)\]

-   **CAP: The Proposal "Would Also Lead To More Than 10 Times More Large Oil Spills," An Increase from 8 to 92 over 30 years.** According to the Center for American Progress, "According to CAP estimates, the Trump administration drilling plan would also lead to more than 10 times more large oil spills than the current plan \[...\] Based on the spill rate associated with increased drilling activity, the number of large oil spills---those of at least 42,000 gallons, or 1,000 barrels---would increase from eight to 92 over the 30-year course of the plan." \[Center for American Progress, [10/23/19](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/news/2019/10/23/475732/trumps-offshore-drilling-plan-environmental-disaster/)\]

'\[H\]e went out of his way to shut down this opportunity by putting forth a new five-year offshore leasing plan that locks up 85 percent of our offshore areas,' he said. 'The plan includes no new drilling, which results in no new American jobs.'" \[The Hill, [6/28/13](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/308433-house-votes-to-expand-offshore-oil-and-gas-leases)\]
