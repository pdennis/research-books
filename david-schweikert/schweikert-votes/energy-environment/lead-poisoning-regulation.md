# Lead Poisoning Regulation

### Flint

**2016: Schweikert Voted For A Water Infrastructure Authorization Bill That Authorized \$100 Million To Help Flint, Michigan Replace Its Water Pipes.** In December 2016, Schweikert voted for a water infrastructure authorization bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "authorize\[d\] approximately \$10 billion for construction of 30 Army Corps of Engineers water projects, including navigation, flood control and environmental restoration projects. It would \[have\] authorize\[d\] feasibility studies for 30 possible water projects, and would \[have\] deauthorize\[d\] nine existing projects. It also would \[have\] create\[d\] an expedited process for deauthorization of other projects that are no longer viable for construction. It would \[have\] authorize\[d\] \$170 million in response to the lead-contaminated water system in Flint, Mich., including \$100 million in capitalization grants to the EPA's Drinking Water State Revolving Fund that the city could use to replace the its water pipes. It also would \[have\] create\[d\] new programs related to safe drinking water. The measure would \[have\] require\[d\] additional water be pumped south from Northern California." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 360 to 61. The Senate later passed the legislation, thus the bill was sent to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 622, [12/8/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll622.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/10/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/S/163?0); Congressional Actions, [S. 612](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/612/all-actions)\]

-   **A Continuing Resolution Appropriating The Funding For Flint Was Passed Earlier.** According to Congressional Quarterly, ""These projects support our nation's economic competitiveness,' said James M. Inhofe, the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. 'We've been talking about the Flint, Mich., tragedy for a long time. It's in here \... . Without this bill, there's nothing for Flint.' Beyond scheduling, the water bill was connected to the CR in another way. Passage of both was needed to deliver \$170 million to Flint to help it repair its drinking water system. Michigan's senators, Democrats Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, had said they'd support the bill as long as it included the aid for Flint." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/10/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-5003243?14)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted For A Continuing Resolution Funding The Government Through April 28, 2017; Legislation Included Expedited Senate Consideration For A Waiver For President-Elect Trump To Appoint James Mattis The Defense Secretary, Funding For The Flint Water Crisis And Funding For Anti-Opioid Addiction Grants.** In December 2016, Schweikert voted for an FY 2017 continuing resolution funding the government through April 28, 2017. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "provide\[d\] funding for federal government operations through April 28, 2017, at an annualized discretionary rate of \$1.07 trillion. The measure also would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$170 million in response to the lead-contaminated drinking water system in Flint, Mich., including \$100 million in capitalization grants for EPA's Drinking Water State Revolving Fund that the city could use to repair its drinking water infrastructure. It also would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$872 million for medical research and anti-opioid addiction grants and would \[have\] transfer\[ed\] a net \$45 million to support extending health benefits for retired coal miners for four months. It would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$10.1 billion in additional Overseas Contingency Operations funds for the Defense Department and certain other security-related accounts. The measure also would \[have\] provide\[d\] for expedited Senate consideration of legislation that would exempt President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Defense secretary, retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis, from a requirement for seven years to have passed before retired military officers can be the Pentagon chief." The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 326 to 96 and the Senate later did, sending the bill to President Obama, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 620, [12/8/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll620.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/9/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/S/161?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2028](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2028/all-actions)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted Against A Continuing Resolution Funding The Government Through December 9, 2016, But Without Aid For Flint, Michigan.** In September 2016, Schweikert voted against a ten week continuing resolution. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation was a "continuing resolution \[...\] that keeps the government running through Dec. 9." In addition, according to Congressional Quarterly, "Democrats and Republicans appear to be locked in a staring contest over the lack of government assistance for Flint, Mich., in a stopgap spending bill, with aides on both sides suggesting they're waiting for the other side to blink. Democrats roundly criticized a GOP written continuing resolution filed Thursday by Senate Republicans, but the measure actually met many of the spending and policy demands Democrats had made throughout weeks of negotiations --- except for a Flint response. Their central objection to the stopgap is the inclusion of flood relief for Louisiana and likely other states without also providing aid for Flint to address major problems caused by lead contamination in the city water supply." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment. The House agreed to the motion, effectively passing the bill by a vote of 342 to 85. The Senate had already passed the legislation. The president then signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 573, [9/28/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll573.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/23/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4963616?21); Congressional Quarterly, [9/26/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4963653?26); Congressional Quarterly, [9/22/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4962089?22); Congressional Actions, [S.

-   **Legislation Was Originally Blocked, Primarily By Senate Democrats, Due To Flint Aid Omission; Deal With Minority Leader Pelosi And Speaker Ryan Over Flint Aid In A Water Bill Sealed The CR's Passage.** According to the Washington Post, "The Senate cemented an agreement Wednesday to avoid an Oct. 1 government shutdown after House Republicans allowed a vote on federal aid to address the water crisis in Flint, Mich., removing a major obstacle in negotiations. \[...\] Democrats made clear earlier this week they would not support the spending bill unless Republicans moved to guarantee Flint aid, while GOP leaders countered the Senate had approved Flint aid earlier this month in a separate water projects bill. The impasse was broken late Tuesday after House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) struck a deal allowing a vote to attach \$170 million in Flint relief to the House version of the water bill. That bill is expected to pass late Wednesday; the stopgap spending measure is expected to pass shortly afterward." \[Washington Post, [9/28/16](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/09/28/house-leaders-reach-deal-on-flint-aid-potentially-averting-shutdown/)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Would Have Authorized \$170 Million For The Army Corps Of Engineers To Provide Support For Presidentially Declared Emergencies, Including Lead Contaminates In Water Such As In Flint, Michigan.** In September 2016, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "authorize\[ed\] the Army Corps of Engineers to provide additional assistance to any community in any state in which the president has declared an emergency as a result of the presence of chemical, physical or biological constituents, including lead or other contaminants in the water system, for the repair or replacement of public and private infrastructure. The amendment would \[have\] authorize\[d\] the appropriation of \$170 million to remain available until expended." The underlying legislation was a water infrastructure bill. The House agreed to the amendment by a vote of 284 to 141. The underlying legislation later passed the House. A different water authorization bill later became law that included authorized funding for Flint. \[House Vote 570, [9/28/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll570.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/28/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/570?15); Congressional Quarterly, [12/10/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/S/163?0); Congressional Actions, [S. 612](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/612/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 1478](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/1478/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5303](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5303/all-actions)\]

-   **House Flint Aid Is Less Specific Than The Senate's Which Also Authorized \$220 Million.** According to the Washington Post, "The federal aid package passed by the Senate would fund a portion of those costs while also helping Flint and other communities deal with the public-health implications of lead exposure. The House version is less specific, authorizing the Army Corps of Engineers to undertake infrastructure repairs. \[...\] McConnell (R-Ky.) unveiled a stopgap spending measure last week that indulged several Democratic demands, including a meticulously constructed deal on Zika funding and the elimination of several contentious policy riders. But it did not incorporate the \$220 million Flint aid package that passed the Senate as part of the water bill." \[Washington Post, [9/28/16](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/09/28/house-leaders-reach-deal-on-flint-aid-potentially-averting-shutdown/)\]

-   **The Amendment Was Critical In Passing A Government-Shutdown Averting Continuing Resolution.** According to the Washington Post, "Congress staved off an Oct. 1 government shutdown Wednesday, passing a stopgap spending measure after House Republicans agreed to address the drinking-water crisis in Flint, Mich., removing a major obstacle in negotiations. \[...\] Democrats made clear earlier this week they would not support the spending bill unless Republicans moved to guarantee Flint aid, while GOP leaders countered the Senate had approved such help earlier this month in a separate water projects bill. The impasse was broken late Tuesday after House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) struck a deal allowing a vote to include \$170 million in Flint relief to the House version of the water bill. That amendment and the underlying bill both passed the House Wednesday evening on bipartisan votes." \[Washington Post, [9/28/16](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/09/28/house-leaders-reach-deal-on-flint-aid-potentially-averting-shutdown/)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Require The EPA To Notify The Public After The EPA Learns Of Unsafe Lead Levels In Drinking Water.** In February 2016, Schweikert voted for legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to forward data that indicates that a public water system contains lead levels that exceed the federal limits to the owner or operator of the water system, who would then need to disseminate information to their customers, including an explanation of the lead level, its potential harm to health and corrective actions being taken. It also would \[have\] require\[d\] the EPA to notify customers if water systems or states don't do so. Additionally, the bill would \[have\] require\[d\] the EPA, in collaboration with water system operators and states, to establish a strategic plan to conduct outreach, education, technical assistance and risk communications to communities affected by lead in public water systems." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 416 to 2. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 67, [2/10/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll067.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/10/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/67?9); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4470](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4470/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Did Address Flint, Michigan.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill, however, does not address the failing water system in Flint. 'I applaud today's action, but hope it is only a first step in addressing this crisis,' said Kildee, who has also sponsored separate legislation (HR 4479) that would appropriate \$750 million for infrastructure improvements, community wellness programs and economic development assistance programs in Flint. 'While it's clear that the state created this man-made crisis, the federal government has in its capacity to help. Congress must act without delay to help Flint families get the immediate and long-term resources they need to recover.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/10/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4832954?17&search=pnCKgmWK)\]

### Lead Renovation

**2017: Schweikert Voted Against Excluding Regulations That Reduce Public Lead Levels In Drinking Water From The REINS Act, Which Required That Major Rules Receive Congressional Approval.** In January 2017, Schweikert voted against an amendment to the REINS Act which would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "exclude\[ed\] rules that would provide for a reduction in the amount of lead in public drinking water from the definition of a 'major rule.'" The underlying legislation was the REINS Act. The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 192 to 231. \[House Vote 16, [1/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll016.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/5/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/16?16); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 7](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/115th-congress/house-amendment/7/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 26](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/26/all-actions)\]

-   **The REINS Act Would Amend The Rule Making Process To Require 'Major Rules' -- Those With An Annual Economic Impact Of More Than \$100 -- To Need Congressional Approval.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "This bill modifies the federal rule-making process by preventing all 'major rules' from being implemented unless Congress enacts legislation approving them. Specifically, it amends the Congressional Review Act (CRA; PL 104-121) to require Congress to approve executive agency regulatory proposals that are deemed to be 'major rules' --- rather than just giving Congress an opportunity to disapprove those proposed rules and regulations, as is currently the case under the CRA. The measure creates expedited procedures for House and Senate consideration of congressional resolutions of approval, which would not be subject to amendment. Under the measure, 'major rules' that would require congressional approval to be implemented generally would be those having an annual economic impact greater than \$100 million. Proposed rules determined to be non-major would not need congressional approval to be implemented, but Congress could move to disapprove such rules using existing CRA disapproval procedures." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/30/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5010999/11?22)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted Against Continuing The EPA's Lead Innovation Rule.** In July 2016, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "remove\[d\] the bill's provisions that would delay implementation of an Environmental Protection Agency rule related to lead renovation, repair and painting." The underlying legislation was an FY 2017 interior and environment appropriations bill. The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 195 to 231. The House later passed the bill, but the Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 429, [7/12/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll429.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/12/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/434?45); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 1303](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/1303/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5538](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5538/all-actions)\]

-   **Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA): The EPA Has Requirements For Workers To Train And Follow Certain Procedures For Lead Work Practices.** In a floor speech, Rep. Cartwright said, "The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed reasonable requirements for workers to train and follow lead-safe work practices. It is important to mention that the rule does not apply to do-it-yourselfers or those making improvements to newer homes." \[Congressional Record, [7/12/16](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2016/07/12/CREC-2016-07-12-pt1-PgH4750-2.pdf)\]

-   **Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA): At Least 4 Million Households Have Children Who Are Exposed To High Lead Levels; In The Wake Of Flint, Michigan, "It Is Unfathomable That This Bill Would Actively Strip One Of EPA's Tools For Addressing Lead Paint In Homes."** In a floor speech, Rep. Cartwright said, "According to the Centers for Disease Control, at least 4 million households have children who are exposed to high levels of lead. This includes 535,000 children younger than the age of 5. The problem is particularly prevalent in low-income communities. Yet, even as lead poisoning is a front page news story, the majority ignores another threat from lead and paint. There is no safe blood level of lead for children. That is why it is so imperative that we do everything we can to help families avoid lead poisoning. \[...\] In light of the tragedy in Flint, Michigan, it is unfathomable that this bill would actively strip one of EPA's tools for addressing lead paint in homes. If we do not remove this harmful rider, we are choosing to endanger the health of our children." \[Congressional Record, [7/12/16](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2016/07/12/CREC-2016-07-12-pt1-PgH4750-2.pdf)\]

-   **Rep. Ken Calvert (R-CA): The Language Does Not Block The Bill, But Would Force The EPA To Approve A Test Kit.** In a floor speech, Rep. Calvert said, "Mr. Chairman, let me be clear, the language in the bill does not block EPA's implementation of the rule. To date, EPA has not yet approved a test kit that meets the false positive and false negative standards. It is yet another example of EPA finalizing a rule with unattainable standards. Therefore, the FY17 bill prompts the EPA to finish what it intended to do 7 years ago---approve a lead test kit as an alternative to costly third-party lab testing so as to prevent delays and reduce the cost of in-home renovations. Otherwise, EPA should solicit formal public comment on alternatives. The language in the bill prevents EPA from collecting fines for paperwork and recordkeeping violations until EPA solicits public comments on alternatives." \[Congressional Record, [7/12/16](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2016/07/12/CREC-2016-07-12-pt1-PgH4750-2.pdf)\]

-   **Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA) Countered That Argument Earlier By Noting That The EPA Recognizes Three Test Kits.** In a floor speech, Rep. Cartwright said, "Opponents argue that when EPA first proposed the rule back in 2008, the rule offered a training exemption for those contractors who used an EPA-approved test kit that meets specific criteria. There are now three EPA recognized test kits available on the market." \[Congressional Record, [7/12/16](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2016/07/12/CREC-2016-07-12-pt1-PgH4750-2.pdf)\]
