-   **Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA): Amendment Reduced A Proposed \$266 Million Cut To Renewable Energy Funding.** According to a floor speech by Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), "Energy that is clean and renewable is where our future lies. To put this in perspective, this budget proposes to cut the investment in renewable energy by \$266 million from last year, and increase investments in fossil fuel by \$34 million. \[...\] I urge all Members to support my amendment, to undo this increase and redirect that money towards supporting the energy of the future\-- renewable energy." \[Congressional Record, [4/29/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/29/house-section/article/H2623-2)\]

-   **Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA): Amendment Prevented A Proposed Increase In Fossil Fuel Funding.** According to a floor speech by Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), "Energy that is clean and renewable is where our future lies. To put this in perspective, this budget proposes to cut the investment in renewable energy by \$266 million from last year, and increase investments in fossil fuel by \$34 million. \[...\] I urge all Members to support my amendment, to undo this increase and redirect that money towards supporting the energy of the future\-- renewable energy." \[Congressional Record, [4/29/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/29/house-section/article/H2623-2)\]

-   **Rep. Michael Simpson (R-ID): "We Are The Saudi Arabia Of Coal."** In a floor speech in opposition to the amendment, Rep. Simpson (R-ID) said, "it is the same debate we used on the other amendment, so I could just say repeat the same debate. The fact is we are investing in what we use: 85 percent of electricity produced in this country is produced by fossil energies. We invest in that to try to make it more clean. We are the Saudi Arabia of coal. Why would we walk away from that? We can do it cleaner. We can do it more efficiently, and that is what we are investing in." \[Congressional Record, [4/29/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/29/house-section/article/H2623-2)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Cutting Funding For Energy Efficiency And Renewable Energy By Increasing Funding For Fossil Energy Research And Development.** In April 2015, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "increase\[d\] funding for fossil energy research and development by \$50 million and reduce funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy by a similar amount." The underlying legislation was H.R. 2028, which was the FY 2016 Energy and Water Development appropriations act. The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 177 to 244. \[House Vote 197, [4/30/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll197.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/30/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/197?10); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 164](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/164/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2028](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2028/all-actions)\]

Amdt. 993 (113th Congress), [Viewed 8/15/14](https://beta.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/993); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 993](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/993/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4923](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4923/all-actions.)\]

-   **To Control and Fund Federal Agencies And Programs, Congress Often Follows A Two-Step Process: It Authorizes Appropriations For A Defined Agency Or Program, And Then Separately Allocates Actual Funding Among Authorized Programs In An Appropriations Act.** According to the Congressional Research Service, "A primary avenue for exercising Congress's power of the purse is the authorization and appropriation of federal spending to carry out government activities. While the power over appropriations is granted to Congress by the U.S. Constitution, the authorization-appropriation process is derived from House and Senate rules. The formal process consists of two sequential steps: (1) enactment of an authorization measure that may create or continue an agency, program, or activity as well as authorize the subsequent enactment of appropriations; and (2) enactment of appropriations to provide funds for the authorized agency, program, or activity." \[CRS Report #RS20371, [11/26/12](http://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid=%270DP%2BPLW%3c%22%40%20%20%0A)\]

-   **Amendment's Sponsor Said He Was Trying To Eliminate Some Of The Bill's \$24 Billion In Funding For Programs Congress Had Not Separately Authorized.** According to the Congressional Record, "\[E\]ver since 1835, the rules of the House have forbidden spending money except for purposes authorized by law. Yet last year, the eleven appropriations bills reported out of the House Appropriations Committee contained over \$350 billion in spending on unauthorized programs. The rule against unauthorized spending cannot be enforced because it is always waived by the resolutions that bring these appropriations to the floor. The bill before us today contains \$24 billion in such unauthorized spending for programs that have not been reviewed by the authorizing committees since as far back as 1980. That was Jimmy Carter\'s last year in office. Now, I am sure that some of these programs are valuable and worthy of taxpayer dollars, but surely, others are not. The fact that they have not been authorized in as much as 35 years ought to warn us to be at least a little more careful about continuing to fund them." \[Congressional Record, [6/9/14](https://beta.congress.gov/crec/2014/07/09/CREC-2014-07-09-pt1-PgH6010-2.pdf)\]

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Cut \$3.1 Billion In Energy Department Funding For Fossil Fuel Research And Development, Nuclear Energy, Renewable Energy And Energy Efficiency.** In July 2014, Schweikert voted for an amendment to the FY 2015 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would decrease by \$3.1 billion the amount provided in the bill for energy efficiency and renewable energy activities, Energy Department nuclear energy activities and fossil energy research and development collectively and transfer the savings to the bill's spending reduction account." The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 97 to 321. \[House Vote 377, [7/9/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll377.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/9/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/377); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 992](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/992/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4923](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4923/all-actions.)\]

-   **Amendment's Sponsor Argued Funding Was Simply "Corporate Welfare" That Subsidized Private Companies R&D Budgets, Distorting The Energy Industry While Not Even Making The Resulting Research Public.** According to the Congressional Record, the amendment's sponsor, Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA), said, "\[T\]his amendment requires energy companies of all kinds to fund their own research and development programs, rather than continuing to require taxpayers to subsidize this activity to the tune of \$3.1 billion. If we are serious about an all-of-the-above energy policy, we have got to stop using taxpayer money to pick winners and losers in the energy industry and start requiring every energy technology to compete on its own merits. For too long, we have suffered from the conceit that politicians can make better energy investments with taxpayer money than investors can with their own money. It is this conceit that has produced a long line of scandals, best illustrated by the Solyndra fiasco. This research doesn't even benefit the common good by placing these discoveries in the public domain. Any discoveries, although they are financed by the public, are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the private companies that received these public funds. Public costs, private benefit -- that is called corporate welfare. That is what these energy subsidies amount to. My amendment protects taxpayers from being forced into paying the research and development budgets of these companies. It gets government out of the energy business and requires all energy companies and all energy technologies to compete equally on their own merits and with their own funds." \[Congressional Record, [7/9/14](https://beta.congress.gov/crec/2014/07/09/CREC-2014-07-09-pt1-PgH5985-2.pdf#page=19)\]

-   **Amendment Opponent Argued It Eliminated "Strategic Investments For Our Energy Independence," Including Research Into Using Coal In Electricity-Producing Fuel Cells.** According to the Congressional Record, House Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee chairman Mike Simpson (R-ID) said, "The bill cuts energy efficiency and renewable energy by \$113 million below last year's level and \$528 million below the budget request. The fossil and nuclear energy programs received modest increases of \$31 million and \$10 million, respectively. The increase to fossil energy will support research into how heat can be more efficiently converted into electricity, how water can be more efficiently used in power plants, and how coal can be used to produce electrical power through fuel cells. The increase to nuclear energy will accommodate a \$10 million increase to support base physical and cybersecurity activities at the Idaho National Laboratory to protect the Nation's nuclear energy materials and a range of national security programs at the NNSA, Homeland Security, and other Federal agencies. Although my colleague asserts that the amendment would keep the government from intervening in the private markets, these applied energy programs are strategic investments for our energy independence." \[Congressional Record, [7/9/14](https://beta.congress.gov/crec/2014/07/09/CREC-2014-07-09-pt1-PgH5985-2.pdf#page=19)\]

**2014: Schweikert Voted Against Reducing Funding For Fossil Fuel Research And Development By \$161.9 Million.** In July 2014, Schweikert voted against , according to Congressional Quarterly, the "Swalwell, D-Calif., amendment that would increase by \$111.6 million the amount provided in the bill for energy efficiency and renewable energy activities and decrease by \$161.9 million the amount provided for fossil energy research and development." The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 172 to 245. \[House Vote 375, [7/9/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll375.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/9/14](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2014/H/375?19); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4923](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4923/all-actions)\]

### Selective Fuel Ban

**2013: Schweikert Effectively Voted To Prohibit A Selective Fuel Ban.** In July 2013, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, an "amendment that would bar the use of funds provided by the bill to enforce the selective fuel ban, which bars federal agencies from entering into contracts for procurement of alternative or synthetic fuel unless it specifies that greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production and combustion of the fuel are less than or equal to emissions from fuel produced from conventional petroleum sources." The vote was on the amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 237 to 189. \[House Vote 394, [7/10/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll394.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/10/13](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2013/H/394?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2397](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2397/all-actions)\]
