# Tennessee Valley Authority

### Sale

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Sell The Tennessee Valley Authority.** In March 2013, Schweikert voted to support selling the Tennessee Valley Authority as part of the Republican Study Committee's proposed budget resolution covering fiscal years 2014 to 2023. According to the Republican Study Committee, "This budget would sell TVA's electric utility functions and associated assets and liabilities to a non-federal owner and operator. TVA would retain its hydropower assets and liabilities because they serve other functions, such as flood control and recreation." The vote was on an amendment to the House budget resolution replacing the entire budget with the RSC's proposed budget; the amendment failed by a vote of 104 to 132 with 171 Democrats voting present. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Repeating a strategy from last year, 171 Democrats voted "present" to push Republicans to vote against the RSC plan to make sure it did not have enough support to replace the Ryan plan." \[House Vote 86, [3/21/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll086.xml); Republican Study Committee, [3/18/13](http://rsc.scalise.house.gov/uploadedfiles/back_to_basics-rsc_fy2014_budget.pdf#11); Congressional Quarterly, [3/25/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/weeklyreport-4245452); Congressional Actions, [H.
