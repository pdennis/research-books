### Renewable Fuel Standard

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Ending The Ethanol Fuel Blending Mandate From The RFS.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted for a budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555, [10/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll555.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/5/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/555?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Budget Called For Ending The Ethanol Fuel Blending Mandate From The RFS** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is a program that requires fuel sold in the U.S. to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels. However, the standard has caused a dramatic increase in the price of corn, food, and gasoline.93 A reform of the standard would end ethanol fuel-blending mandates. This proposal mirrors Representative Bob Goodlatte's H.R. 1314, the Renewable Fuel Standard Elimination Act." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed 10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted For Eliminating The Renewable Fuel Standard As Part Of The FY 2016 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted for repealing the RFS. According to the Republican Study Committee, "The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is a program that requires fuel sold in the U.S. to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels. However, the standard has caused the dramatic increase in the price of corn, food and gasoline. A reform of the standard would end ethanol fuel-blending mandates. This proposal mirrors Representative Goodlatte's Renewable Fuel Standard Elimination Act (H.R. 703)." Rep. Bob Goodlatte's legislation would "eliminates the RFS and makes ethanol compete in the free market." The underlying budget resolution would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] for \$2.804 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2016, not including off-budget accounts. The substitute would call for reducing spending by \$7.1 trillion over 10 years compared to the Congressional Budget Office baseline." The vote was on the substitute amendment to a Budget Resolution. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 132 to 294. \[House Vote 138, [3/25/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll138.xml); Republican Study Committee, [FY 2016 Budget](http://rsc.flores.house.gov/files/Initiatives/rsc-budget.pdf); Press Release Rep.
