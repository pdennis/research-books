### Weaken The Weatherization Program To Improve Energy Efficiency

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Reauthorizing The Weatherization Assistance Program And The State Energy Program.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "reauthorize\[d\] the Weatherization Assistance Program, under the Energy Conservation and Production Act, and the State Energy Program, under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, through FY 2020." The underlying legislation was H.R. 8, an energy security and infrastructure bill. The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 198 to 224. \[House Vote 661, [12/2/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll661.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/2/15](http://cq.com/vote/2015/H/661?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **The Weatherization Assistance Program Provides Grants To States In Order To Improve Energy Efficiency To Low-Income Families' Homes; Since 1976, The Program Has Reduced The Energy Bills Of More Than 7 Million Families.** According to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, "The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Weatherization Assistance Program provides grants to states, territories, and some Indian tribes to improve the energy efficiency of the homes of low-income families. These governments, in turn, contract with local governments and nonprofit agencies to provide weatherization services to those in need using the latest technologies for home energy upgrades. Since the program began in 1976, DOE has helped improve the lives of than 7 million families by reducing their energy bills." \[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, [Accessed 3/22/15](http://energy.gov/eere/wipo/weatherization-assistance-program)\]

-   **The State Energy Program Provides Funding To States To Help Them Advance The State's Clean Energy Economy.** According to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, "The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) State Energy Program (SEP) provides funding and technical assistance to state and territory energy offices to help them advance their clean energy economy while contributing to national energy goals. \[...\] SEP also provides leadership to maximize the benefits of energy efficiency and renewable energy in each state through communications and outreach activities and technology deployment, and by providing access to new partnerships and resources." \[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, [Accessed 3/22/15](http://energy.gov/eere/wipo/state-energy-program)\]
