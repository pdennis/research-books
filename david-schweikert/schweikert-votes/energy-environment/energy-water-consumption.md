The vote was on the adoption of amendments. The House adopted the amendments by a vote 224-204. \[House Vote 372, [7/19/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll372.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/19/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/372?5); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 298](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/117th-congress/house-amendment/298/actions?s=a&r=4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8294](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8294/actions)\]
