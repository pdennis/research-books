# District Of Columbia

### Youth Offenders

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Limit "Youth Offenders" In The District Of Columbia To Individuals Under Eighteen Rather Than Twenty-Four And To Require The Establishment Of A Public Website With Juvenile Crime Data.** In May 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would amend D.C. Official Code to limit 'youth offenders' to individuals 18 years old or younger, instead of 24 years old or younger, and make conforming changes to D.C. law. It would direct the D.C. attorney general to establish and operate, within 180 days of the bill\'s enactment, a publicly accessible website that contains D.C. juvenile crime data, including the number of arrested juveniles, demographic data and information about certain petty and violent crimes committed, among other information. The website would be updated monthly and appropriately archived to provide indefinite public access to historical data on juvenile arrests and prosecutions. The bill would prohibit publishing personally identifiable information on the website. It also would prohibit the D.C. Council from enacting any act, resolution or rule to change any criminal liability sentences in effect on the date of the bill\'s enactment." The House passed the bill by a vote of 225 to 181. \[House Vote 201, [5/15/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll201.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/15/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/201?16); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7530](http://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7530/all-actions)\]
