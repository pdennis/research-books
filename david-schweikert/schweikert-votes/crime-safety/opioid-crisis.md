### \$160 Million In Funding For Substance Abuse Programs

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Providing \$160 Million More In Funding For Programs And Activities Of The Substance Abuse And Mental Health Administration As Part Of The FY 2016 Omnibus.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted against funding the NIH at an increased level. According to Congressional Quarterly, "the agreement provides \$3.8 billion for programs and activities of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, \$160 million (4%) more than the comparable FY 2015 level and \$115 million (3%) more than requested. Under the agreement, the substance abuse block grant receives \$1.9 billion, \$38 million more than FY 2015 and the request. The mental health block grant, meanwhile, receives \$533 million, \$50 million more than FY 2015." The legislation was, according to Congressional Quarterly, a FY 2016 Omnibus Appropriations bill. The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill with an amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 316 to 113. The legislation was later combined with a tax extender bill. The Senate passed the larger measure and the president signed it. \[House Vote 705, [12/18/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll705.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/18/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/S/339?20); Congressional Quarterly, [12/15/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/705?20); Congressional Quarterly, [12/17/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4809119?25); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2029](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029/all-actions)\]

Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), "Opioid Abuse Programs at SAMHSA and CDC: A total of \$123 million \-- an increase of \$91 million or 284 percent over FY2015 levels - for programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) related to combatting opioid abuse. Last month, Ayotte and Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) led a bipartisan coalition in urging Senate appropriators to include in the final government funding bill the highest possible level of funding for the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant program and the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment - programs located within SAMHSA." \[Sen. Ayotte Press Release, [12/18/15](http://www.ayotte.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=2395)\]

Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), "\$211 million for SAMHSA substance abuse prevention, including \$12 million to assist states with naloxone distribution and training, and \$10 million for the Strategic Prevention Framework Prescription Drug Abuse program to increase awareness of opioid abuse in local communities. \[...\] \$7 million for Anti-Heroin Task Forces within the \$212 million Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program. In October, Ayotte wrote to DOJ and encouraged the department to work with the state to identify additional funding streams-including the COPS office-that may help New Hampshire reduce the backlog of samples awaiting analysis." \[Sen. Ayotte Press Release, [12/18/15](http://www.ayotte.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=2395)\]

-   **Legislation Included \$13 million for Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs.** According to a press release from Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), "\$13 million for Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs). These funds will assist states to improve PDMPs, an important tool in preventing prescription drug abuse. In addition to her history of advocacy for PDMPs, Ayotte authored the Heroin and Prescription Opioid Abuse, Prevention, Education, and Enforcement Act. The bill would authorize the Harold Rogers Prescription Drug Monitoring Program - a competitive grant program that helps states support their PDMPs." \[Sen. Ayotte Press Release, [12/18/15](http://www.ayotte.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=2395)\]

### ACA Navigators

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against Requiring ACA Navigators Get Opioid-Specific Training For Coverage Of Opioid-Related Health Treatment.** In May 2019, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require that 'navigators' certified to help individuals enroll in Affordable Care Act marketplace plans receive opioid-specific training on coverage of opioid-related health care treatment under qualified plans."

**2019: Schweikert Voted For Enhancing Border Security Operations To Prevent Narcotics Such As Fentanyl From Entering The U.S.** In September 2019, Schweikert voted for a bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "authorize the Homeland Security Department to establish a joint task force to enhance border security operations to prevent narcotics such as fentanyl and other synthetic opioids from entering the U.S. Additionally, the bill would expand the authority of DHS joint task forces to collaborate with other federal agencies and private sector organizations." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion and passed the bill by a vote of 403-1. The bill was never taken up in the Senate. \[House Vote 554, [9/27/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll554.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/27/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/554?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3722](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3722/all-actions)\]

### Cooperation With Mexican Law Enforcement

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Strengthen Cooperation With Mexican Law Enforcement To Counter The Trafficking Of Opioids.** In June 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would require the State Department, in coordination with the U.S. Agency for International Development, to submit to the congressional foreign issues committees a strategy for strengthening cooperation between U.S. and Mexican law enforcement and other authorities to curb the trafficking of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. It would require the State Department, before implementing the strategy, to notify the congressional foreign issues, judiciary, intelligence and homeland security committees of any data that would be shared with foreign nations under such a plan. It would require the president, within two years of the strategy submission, to update the congressional foreign issues committees on its implementation and effectiveness. It also would require the State Department, in consultation with the Treasury Department, to report to the congressional foreign issues, House Financial Services and Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs committees on steps the departments could take to expand financial access to Caribbean community member states." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 368 to 19. \[House Vote 282, [6/25/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll282.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/25/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/282?11); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2789](http://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2789/all-actions)\]

### Fentanyl

**2020: Schweikert Voted For Extending A Temporary Ban On Certain Potent Opioids, Allowing Law Enforcement To Prosecute Individuals In Possession Of The Drug.** In January 2020, Schweikert voted for a bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "extend, through May 6, 2021, the temporary classification of fentanyl-related substances as schedule I controlled substances by the Drug Enforcement Agency, thus extending the prohibition on possession or importation of such drugs." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 320-88, which cleared the bill for the President's signature. \[House Vote 32, [1/29/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll032.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/32?1); Congressional Actions, [S.3201](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3201?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22s+3201%22%5D%7d&s=1&r=1)\]

-   **The Bill Extended The Classification Of Fentanyl As A Schedule I Drug, Allowing Law Enforcement To Prosecute Individuals In Possession Of The Drug.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Legislation would extend the classification of fentanyl as a Schedule I drug, or those that have the highest potential for abuse, for 15 months. Scheduling fentanyl allows law enforcement to prosecute individuals who produce or distribute the drug or its analogues." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5823662?4)\]

-   **Some Democrats Opposed The Bill Due To Possible Unintended Effects On Criminal Justice.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Some advocates say the ban could also have unintended effects on criminal justice and on limiting scientific research \[...\] 'We must remember that a criminal justice approach disproportionately affects communities of color, and does not necessarily reduce the crime.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5823662?4)\]

-   **The Drug Policy Alliance Compared Efforts To Increase Penalties To "Mass Incarceration During The Crack Cocaine Epidemic."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Criminal justice groups have had concerns that language in the bill could expose low-level users to harsh mandatory minimum penalties. Last week, the Drug Policy Alliance released a report warning against congressional efforts to increase penalties related to fentanyl, comparing it to mass incarceration during the crack cocaine epidemic." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5823662?4)\]

-   **Assistant Secretary For Health Brett Giorir Stated That There Were "Significant Administrative Challenges" In Researching Schedule I Substances.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Assistant Secretary for Health Brett P. Giroir acknowledged \[...\] that there have been 'significant administrative challenges' related to research on Schedule I substances. Researching some opioids may lead to advancements in the development of drugs to treat chronic pain and addiction." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5823662?4)\]

### Fentanyl Classification

**2025: Schweikert Voted To Permanently Classify All Fentanyl-Related Substances As Schedule I Controlled Substances.** In February 2025, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would permanently classify all fentanyl-related substances as Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act, unless they are specifically exempted or listed in another schedule. It also would establish new expedited registration procedures for the use of controlled substances in research, including Schedule I and II drugs. The measure would define a fentanyl-related substance as one that contains salts, isomers and salts of isomers of fentanyl with a specific chemical designation. It would allow the attorney general to publish a list of fentanyl-related substances, though a drug not included in the list could still be restricted as a Schedule I drug if it meets the bill's chemical definition. The measure also would extend to those drugs the mandatory minimum sentencing requirements under current law for certain illegal substances." The House passed the bill by a vote of 312 to 108. \[House Vote 33, [2/6/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll033.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/6/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/33?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 27](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/27/all-actions)\]

-   **Some Democrats Opposed The Bill Out Of Concern For Increased Mass Incarceration.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "While the bill was bipartisan, some Democrats expressed dismay that it could result in more mass incarcerations." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/14/25](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8199191?2)\]

### Fentanyl-Related Substances Classification

**2023: Schweikert Voted To Classify Fentanyl-Related Substances As Schedule I Substances And Ease Restrictions On Government-Funded Research Of Schedule I And Schedule II Substances.** In May 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Halt All Lethal Trafficking of (HALT) Fentanyl Act, which would "permanently classify all fentanyl-related substances as Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act - unless they are specifically exempted or listed in another schedule - thereby extending to those drugs mandatory minimum sentencing requirements. It would also establish expedited procedures for the use of Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances in research. The bill would permit researchers who are currently registered to study Schedule I and Schedule II to begin research on additional substances beginning 30 days after they notify the Justice Department, if the research is part of an investigational use exemption; conducted or funded by the Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs or Defense departments; and the researcher provides certain information on the substances to be used and demonstrates they are authorized by state law to conduct such research. It would require the Justice Department to approve or deny the registration status of a new researcher within 45 days of receiving an application. It would also allow additional researchers at the same institution or at related research sites to be added to an existing registration instead of registering separately; require researchers working on substances newly classified under Schedule I to submit research applications within 90 days of the new classification; and allow researchers to manufacture small quantities of Schedule I substances for research purposes without first obtaining a manufacturing registration. Among other provisions, the bill would require the Justice Department to issue regulations to implement the bill's provisions within six months of its enactment. It would also express the sense of Congress that it agrees with a 2021 U.S. Court of Appeals decision (United States v. McCray) that concluded that a substance can be an analogue of fentanyl even if it is not listed as a controlled substance analogue and that dealing in 10 grams or more of a fentanyl analogue is subject to enhanced penalty. The bill would define fentanyl-related substances as those structurally related to fentanyl by certain substitutions, which contain the salts, isomers, and salts of isomers of fentanyl within a specific chemical designation." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 289 to 133, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 237, [5/25/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll237.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/25/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/237?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 467](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/467/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Would Change Fentanyl Analog's Schedule II Classification To A Class I Substance.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House passed legislation Thursday that would permanently classify fentanyl analogs as controlled substances, but the measure faces slim odds in the Senate because of Democrats' criminal justice concerns. Fentanyl, which is responsible for the majority of U.S. drug-related deaths, is already permanently classified as a Schedule II drug --- meaning it has a high risk for abuse but is also used in medical settings." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/25/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7754839?11)\]

-   **By Making It A Schedule I Substance, Fentanyl Analogs Would Be Considered To Have A High Risk For Abuse Without Known Medical Use.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill passed Thursday (HR 467), as amended, by a vote of 289-133, with 74 Democrats joining Republicans. It would classify all fentanyl analogs as Schedule I, meaning they have a high potential for abuse and no known medical use." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/25/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7754839?11)\]

-   **The Bill Would Ease Restrictions On Government-Funded Research For Schedule I Substances.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill would also ease restrictions on government-funded research of these substances. If enacted, users, sellers or those possessing the drugs could face penalties under a 1970 law known as the Controlled Substances Act." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/25/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7754839?11)\]

-   **Fentanyl-Related Substances Were Chemical Similar Drugs Different From Fentanyl And Were Used By Illicit Drug Makers To Avoid Prosecution Targeted At A Specific Chemical.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Food and Drug Administration has authorized fentanyl to be used for pain relief and as an anesthetic. Fentanyl-related substances, or FRS, refer to chemically similar drugs that are distinct from fentanyl. Illicit drugmakers may make analogs of a drug to avoid prosecution targeted at a specific chemical." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/25/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7754839?11)\]

-   **The Trump Administration Began To Classify Fentanyl-Related Substances As Schedule I Since 2018 And The Policy Has Been Extended Through Spending Bills.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Trump administration classified FRS as Schedule I drugs in 2018 on an emergency basis. Since then, FRS scheduling has been added to spending bills as an extender while lawmakers seek a bipartisan solution." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/25/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7754839?11)\]

**2023: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Would Have Postponed Implementation Of The HALT Fentanyl Act Until The HHS Were To Guarantee That It Would Decrease Overdose Deaths.** In May 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against an amendment to the Halt All Lethal Trafficking of (HALT) Fentanyl Act, which would "prohibit the bill\'s provisions from taking effect until the Health and Human Services and Justice departments certify that its provisions will lead to a reduction in overdose deaths." The vote was on the adoption of an amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 190 to 233. \[House Vote 236, [5/25/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll236.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/25/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/236?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 467](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/467/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 184](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/184/actions?s=a&r=1)\]

**2023: Schweikert Effectively Voted For The Halt All Lethal Trafficking Of (HALT) Fentanyl Act, Which Would Classify Fentanyl As A Schedule I Controlled Substance.** In May 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the "adoption of the rule (H Res 429) that would provide for floor consideration of the Halt All Lethal Trafficking of (HALT) Fentanyl Act (HR 467); \[...\] The rule would provide for up to one hour of general debate on each measure. It would make in order floor consideration of three amendments to HR 467." The vote was on adoption of the rule. The House adopted the rule by a vote of 217 to 204. \[House Vote 231, [5/23/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll231.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/23/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/231?17); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 429](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/429/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 467](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/467/all-actions)\]

**2023: Schweikert Effectively Voted For The Halt All Lethal Trafficking Of (HALT) Fentanyl Act, Which Would Classify Fentanyl As A Schedule I Controlled Substance.** In May 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the "motion to order the previous question (thus ending debate and possibility of amendment) on the rule (H Res 429) that would provide for floor consideration of the Halt All Lethal Trafficking of (HALT) Fentanyl Act (HR 467); \[...\] The rule would provide for up to one hour of general debate on each measure. It would make in order floor consideration of three amendments to HR 467." The vote was on a motion to order the previous question. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 219 to 208. \[House Vote 230, [5/23/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll230.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/23/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/230?16); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 429](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/429/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 467](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/467/all-actions)\]

**2018: Schweikert Voted For An FY 2019 Conference Report Minibus Spending Bill And Continuing Resolution That Appropriated Nearly \$3.8 Billion For Opioids Abuse.** In September 2018, Schweikert voted for an FY 2019 Labor, HHS, Education, and Defense minibus spending bill conference report. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Adoption of the conference report on the bill that would provide \$855.1 billion in discretionary funding for fiscal 2019 to various departments and agencies, including \$674.4 billion for the Defense Department and \$178.1 billion for the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education departments. The Defense Department total would include \$606.5 billion in base Defense Department funding subject to spending caps, and would include \$67.9 billion in overseas contingency operations funding. The bill would provide \$90.3 billion in discretionary spending for the Health and Human Services Department, \$71.4 billion for the Education Department and \$12.1 billion for the Labor Department.

The president later signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 405, [9/26/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll405.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/26/18](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2018/H/405?2); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 6157](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6157/all-actions)\]

-   **The Legislation Appropriated About \$6.7 Billion For The Substance Abuse And Mental Health With About \$3.8 Billion Explicitly For Opioids.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The agreement includes almost \$6.7 billion to address substance abuse and mental health, including opioid and heroin abuse, with almost \$3.8 billion directly addressing opioids --- an increase of \$206 million according to appropriators. It rejects deep cuts or the elimination of many programs proposed by the Trump administration, most of which would continue to be funded at or near FY 2018 levels, including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), Community Services Block Grants, 21st Century community learning centers and other assorted education programs, VISTA and Senior Volunteer Corps programs, AmeriCorps, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting." \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/25/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5393543?0)\]

**2018: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Appropriating Nearly \$1 Billion Annually In Funding For State Opioid Grants.** In June 2018, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "appropriate\[d\] \$995 million annually, for fiscal 2019 through 2021, for state opioid grant programs and would allow the Health and Human Services Department to increase the number of residency positions at hospitals that have established programs related to addiction." The underlying legislation was an opioid abuse prevention bill. The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion, thereby rejected the amendment by a vote of 185 to 226. \[House Vote 287, [6/22/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll287.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/22/18](http://cq.com/vote/2018/H/287?2); Congressional Quarterly, [6/22/18](http://cq.com/vote/2018/H/288?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 6](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6/all-actions)\]

**2018: Schweikert Voted Against The \$1.3 Trillion FY 2018 Omnibus Spending Deal Which Raised Spending By \$138 Billion Over FY 2017 Levels, Including A \$3 Billion Increase In Programs To Combat The Opioid Crisis.** In March 2018, Schweikert voted against the FY 2018 Omnibus spending bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Combined, the spending measures would provide about \$1.3 trillion in discretionary spending, with \$1.2 trillion subject to discretionary spending caps, and \$78.1 billion designated as Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The measure\'s spending levels are consistent with the increased defense and non-defense budget caps set by the two-year budget deal agreed to last month. That agreement increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80 billion and the non-defense cap by \$63 billion. Given that the previous caps were set to reduce overall discretionary spending by \$5 billion, the net increase provided by the omnibus is \$138 billion over the FY 2017 level." The vote was on the motion to concur in the Senate Amendment with an Amendment. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 256 to 167. The Senate later agreed to the legislation, sending it to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 127, [3/22/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll127.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/22/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5287294?5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1625](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1625/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Included A \$4.65 Billion In Anti-Opioid Crisis Funding.** According to the Washington Post, "The bill increases funding to tackle the opioid epidemic, a boost that lawmakers from both parties hailed as a win. The legislation allocates more than \$4.65 billion across agencies to help states and local governments on efforts toward prevention, treatment and law enforcement initiatives. That represents a \$3 billion increase over 2017 spending levels." \[Washington Post, [3/22/18](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2018/03/22/heres-what-congress-is-stuffing-into-its-1-3-trillion-spending-bill/?utm_term=.51975194623a)\]

**2018: Schweikert Voted Against A February 2018 Two-Year Budget Deal Which, Among Other Things, Increased Spending By \$300 Billion, Suspended The Debt Ceiling, Reauthorized Community Health Centers For Two Years And Provided \$6 Billion Over Two Years In Anti-Opioid Epidemic Funding.** In February 2018, Schweikert voted against a two-year budget deal that re-opened the government after a brief shutdown. According to the New York Times, "With Mr. Trump's signature, the government will reopen before many Americans were aware it had closed, with a deal that includes about \$300 billion in additional funds over two years for military and nonmilitary programs, almost \$90 billion in disaster relief in response to last year's hurricanes and wildfires, and a higher statutory debt ceiling." In addition, according to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation "would provide funding for federal government operations and services at current levels through March 23, 2018 \[...\] \[and\] retroactively extends numerous tax breaks that expired at the end of 2016. It also extends the CHIP program for another four years (through FY 2027) and funds community health centers for another two years." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the bill. The House agreed to the motion, essentially on passage, by a vote of 240 to 186. The bill was then sent to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 69, [2/9/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll069.xml); New York Times, [2/8/18](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/us/politics/congress-budget-deal-vote.html); Congressional Quarterly, [2/9/18](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2018/H/69?21); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1892](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1892/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Provided \$6 Billion Over Two Years In Anti-Opioid Epidemic Funding.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "\$6 billion (\$3 billion FY 2018 and \$3 billion for FY 2019) to combat the opioid epidemic, including enhanced state grants, public prevention programs and law enforcement activities related to substance abuse and mental health programs." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/9/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5262332?3)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted For A Continuing Resolution Funding The Government Through April 28, 2017; Legislation Included Expedited Senate Consideration For A Waiver For President-Elect Trump To Appoint James Mattis The Defense Secretary, Funding For The Flint Water Crisis And Funding For Anti-Opioid Addiction Grants.** In December 2016, Schweikert voted for an FY 2017 continuing resolution funding the government through April 28, 2017. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "provide\[d\] funding for federal government operations through April 28, 2017, at an annualized discretionary rate of \$1.07 trillion. The measure also would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$170 million in response to the lead-contaminated drinking water system in Flint, Mich., including \$100 million in capitalization grants for EPA's Drinking Water State Revolving Fund that the city could use to repair its drinking water infrastructure. It also would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$872 million for medical research and anti-opioid addiction grants and would \[have\] transfer\[ed\] a net \$45 million to support extending health benefits for retired coal miners for four months. It would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$10.1 billion in additional Overseas Contingency Operations funds for the Defense Department and certain other security-related accounts. The measure also would \[have\] provide\[d\] for expedited Senate consideration of legislation that would exempt President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Defense secretary, retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis, from a requirement for seven years to have passed before retired military officers can be the Pentagon chief." The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 326 to 96 and the Senate later did, sending the bill to President Obama, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 620, [12/8/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll620.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/9/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/S/161?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2028](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2028/all-actions)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted Against A Continuing Resolution Funding The Government Through December 9, 2016 Which Included \$37 Million To Combat Opioid Abuse, But Did Not Include Aid For Flint, Michigan.** In September 2016, Schweikert voted against a ten week continuing resolution. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation was a "continuing resolution \[...\] that keeps the government running through Dec. 9." In addition, according to Congressional Quarterly, "A proposed stopgap continuing resolution would provide a down payment of funding to combat the nation's opioid epidemic. \[...\] The GOP continuing resolution unveiled Thursday includes money needed to jump-start efforts authorized by a new opioid law (PL 114-198). The Senate measure would allow the Health and Human Services and Justice departments to start work on select new initiatives, something usually barred by CRs. HHS would be able to immediately start spending funds that, if annualized, would total \$17 million. Similarly, Justice could begin spending funds that would total \$20 million on an annualized rate for programs authorized by the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, known as CARA, according to the text of the CR." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment. The House agreed to the motion, effectively passing the bill by a vote of 342 to 85. The Senate had already passed the legislation. The president then signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 573, [9/28/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll573.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/22/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/4962355?29); Congressional Quarterly, [9/26/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4963653?26); Congressional Quarterly, [9/22/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4962089?22); Congressional Actions, [S.

-   **Democrats Objected To The CR Because It Did Not Include Aid For Flint, Michigan.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Democrats and Republicans appear to be locked in a staring contest over the lack of government assistance for Flint, Mich., in a stopgap spending bill, with aides on both sides suggesting they're waiting for the other side to blink. Democrats roundly criticized a GOP written continuing resolution filed Thursday by Senate Republicans, but the measure actually met many of the spending and policy demands Democrats had made throughout weeks of negotiations --- except for a Flint response. Their central objection to the stopgap is the inclusion of flood relief for Louisiana and likely other states without also providing aid for Flint to address major problems caused by lead contamination in the city water supply." \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/26/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4963653?26)\]

-   **Legislation Was Originally Blocked, Primarily By Senate Democrats, Due To Flint Aid Omission; Deal With Minority Leader Pelosi And Speaker Ryan Over Flint Aid In A Water Bill Sealed The CR's Passage.** According to the Washington Post, "The Senate cemented an agreement Wednesday to avoid an Oct. 1 government shutdown after House Republicans allowed a vote on federal aid to address the water crisis in Flint, Mich., removing a major obstacle in negotiations. \[...\] Democrats made clear earlier this week they would not support the spending bill unless Republicans moved to guarantee Flint aid, while GOP leaders countered the Senate had approved Flint aid earlier this month in a separate water projects bill. The impasse was broken late Tuesday after House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) struck a deal allowing a vote to attach \$170 million in Flint relief to the House version of the water bill. That bill is expected to pass late Wednesday; the stopgap spending measure is expected to pass shortly afterward." \[Washington Post, [9/28/16](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/09/28/house-leaders-reach-deal-on-flint-aid-potentially-averting-shutdown/)\]

### Health Coverage

**2018: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Funding Matching Federal Grants To The States For Health Care Treatment For Those Suffering From Substance Abuse Disorders, Where States Could Only Receive The Funding If Medicaid Was Expanded In The State.** In June 2018, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "replace\[d\] the bill's provisions with a program that would provide federal matching funds for the treatment for eligible individuals suffering from substance abuse disorders. It would require that states extend Medicaid eligibility to receive such federal funds." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 190 to 226. \[House Vote 275, [6/20/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll275.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/20/18](http://cq.com/vote/2018/H/275?0); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5797](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5797/all-actions)\]

**2017: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Requiring Association Health Plans (AHPs) That Would Be Exempt From Most State Laws And Regulations To Require Coverage For Substance Abuse Treatment.** In March 2017, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] association health plans to provide coverage for substance abuse disorder treatments." The underlying legislation would have, also according to Congressional Quarterly, "expand\[ed\] the ability of trade and business associations to sponsor association health plans (AHPs), through which member companies can offer group health insurance to their employees. To encourage the creation of new AHPs, it exempt\[ed\] AHPs from most state laws and regulations and allows AHPs to set their own health insurance standards, with few mandated requirements." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 179 to 233. \[House Vote 185, [3/22/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll185.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/22/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/185?4); Congressional Quarterly, [3/17/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5064584/14?11); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1101](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1101/all-actions)\]

### Opioid Abuse Grants

**2021: Schweikert Voted For Authorizing \$1.75 Billion Through FY 2027 Annually For Opioid Abuse Grants, And Grants Must Be Awarded To States Of At Least \$4 Million And Tribes With High Rates Of Opioid Usage Must Be Prioritized.** In October 2021, Schweikert voted for the State Opioid Response Grant Authorization Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "reauthorize and modify a Health and Human Services Department opioid abuse grant program. Specifically, it would authorize \$1.75 billion annually through fiscal 2027 for HHS grants to states and tribes to address opioid and stimulant use and misuse. Among other provisions, it would require the department, in awarding grants, to ensure that each state receives at least \$4 million and give preference to states and tribes with relatively high rates of opioid use disorder or stimulant use." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 380-46. \[House Vote 320, [10/20/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll320.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/20/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/320?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2379](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2379/actions)\]

-   **The Measure Would Provide Funding For Grants To States And Tribes To Tackle Opioid And Stimulant Addiction By Investment In Treatment And Prevention.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The funding would provide states and tribes with grants to combat opioid and stimulant addiction through treatment and prevention programs." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/19/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6367209?10)\]

### Rural Opioid Abuse Prevention

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Establish A Pilot Grant Program For Rural Areas To Create Community Response Programs Focused On Lowering Opioid Deaths, Including Imprisonment Alternatives.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Rural Opioid Abuse Prevention Act, which would "expand the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program to allow the Justice Department to make grants for a pilot program for rural areas to implement community response programs that focus on reducing opioid deaths, including to provide alternatives to incarceration. The bill would require funded programs to identify gaps in community prevention, treatment and recovery services for individuals who encounter the criminal justice system and establish treatment protocols to address these gaps. It would also require grants to be jointly operated by local governments, public safety and public health agencies, and behavioral health collaborations." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 408-11, thus the bill was sent to President Biden and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 509, [12/6/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll509.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/6/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/509?9); Congressional Actions, [S. 2796](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2796/all-actions)\]

### SUPPORT Act

**2018: Schweikert Voted For Legislation That Would Have Effectively Expand Both Medicare And Medicaid To Cover Medication-Assisted Treatment For Opioids And Allowed Medicaid Patients With Opioid Use Disorders To Stay At In Certain Treatment Facilities For Up To 30 Days.** In September 2018, Schweikert voted for a bill that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] for the concurrence by the House in the Senate amendment to HR 6, with an amendment that would modify Medicare and Medicaid and a variety of other health programs in relation to opioid abuse. It would \[have\] expand\[d\] both Medicare and Medicaid to cover medication-assisted treatment for substance use disorder and would place new requirements on states regarding Medicaid drug review and utilization requirements. It would \[have\] appropriate\[d\] \$15 million annually, from fiscal 2019 through 2023, to support the establishment or operation of public health laboratories to detect synthetic opioids. As amended, the bill would \[have\] allow\[ed\] Medicaid patients with opioid use or cocaine use disorders to stay up to 30 days per year in certain treatment facilities with more than 16 beds." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and adopt a resolution amending H.R. 6. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the resolution and thus providing for concurrence between the House and Senate, by a vote of 393 to 8. The Senate later agreed to the bill and it was signed into law by the president. \[House Vote 415, [9/28/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll415.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/28/18](http://cq.com/vote/2018/H/415?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 6](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H. Res. 1099](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-resolution/1099/all-actions)\]

The House rejected the motion by a vote of 191 to 235. \[House Vote 336, [6/28/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll336.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/28/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/336?7); Congressional Quarterly, [6/28/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/337?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1215](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1215/all-actions)\]
