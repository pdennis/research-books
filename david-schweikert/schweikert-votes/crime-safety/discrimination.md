### Barring Members Of Congress From Using Taxpayer Funds To Settle Discrimination Lawsuits

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against Prohibiting Members From Using Taxpayer Funding To Settle Discrimination Suits As Part Of A Larger Anti-Corruption And Democracy Reform Bill.** In March 2019, Schweikert voted against The 'For The People Act.' According to Congressional Quarterly, "It also prohibits members from using taxpayer funds to settle cases of employment discrimination against them. The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act enacted in December (PL 115-397) prohibits members from using taxpayer funds to settle cases of sexual harassment, but not discrimination. The measure adds employment discrimination to that December law, thereby requiring members to repay Treasury for any settlement or award involving such discrimination." The overall was, also according to CBS News, "the most sweeping anti-corruption measure passed by the House of Representatives in a generation, by a vote of 234 to 193. The bill focuses on voting rights, campaign finance, and government ethics." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 234 to 193. \[House Vote 118, [3/8/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll118.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/5/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5476854?1); CBS News, [3/8/19](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-passes-hr-1-sweeping-anti-corruption-and-voting-rights-legislation-today-2019-03-08/); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions)\]
