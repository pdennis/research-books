### Expanding Justice And Mental Health Collaboration Programs

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Allow Mental Health Collaboration Program Grants To Be Used For Training For Prosecutors Over Diversion Programs, Implementing Crisis Call Response Teams, Implementing Suicide Prevention Services For Imprisoned Individuals, Enhancing Access To Mental Health And Substance Use Disorder Services For Qualified Offenders, And Expanding The 988 National Suicide Prevention And Mental Health Crisis Hotline.** In November 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Reauthorization Act of 2022, which would "expand eligible uses of Justice Department Mental Health Collaboration Program grants to states, local governments and tribes to plan and implement programs to serve individuals accused of an offense who have been diagnosed with a mental illness. Specifically, the bill would allow grants to be used for training prosecutors about diversion programs, which are mental health treatment alternatives to incarceration; implementing multidisciplinary crisis call response teams that include specially trained officers and mental health crisis workers; developing and implementing suicide prevention services for incarcerated individuals; increasing access to mental health care and substance use disorder services and providing case management services for qualified offenders and individuals released from prison; and implementing and expanding the 988 national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system. It would require multidisciplinary crisis response teams that receive grant funding to provide response capability 24 hours each day and seven days each week, to the extent practicable. The bill would also reauthorize \$2 million annually through fiscal 2027 for a Justice Department report on the prevalence of offenders with serious mental illness." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 389-22, thus the bill was sent to President Biden and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 487, [11/29/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll487.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/29/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/487?20); Congressional Actions, [S. 3846](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3846/all-actions)\]

### Intervention Grants

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Awarding Grants To State, Local And Tribal Governments To Establish Or Expand Programs That Dispatch Mental Health Experts Instead Of Law Enforcement Officers If A Person Experiences A Mental Health Crisis.** In September 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the Mental Health Justice Act of 2022, which would "require the Health and Human Services Department to award grants to states, localities, tribes and tribal organizations to establish or expand programs to hire, train and dispatch mental health professionals to respond in lieu of law enforcement officers in emergencies where an individual calls an emergency hotline regarding a mental health crisis or where a law enforcement officer or first responder identifies that an individual has a mental illness or disability, or is under the influence of drugs. The grants could also be used for training mental health professionals in de-escalation and developmentally appropriate techniques, connecting individuals with voluntary community-based services, training dispatch center staff and coordinating with law enforcement agencies. The bill would authorize \$250 million annually through fiscal 2027 for the program. It would require HHS to distribute additional funds to grantees that demonstrate program success and to prioritize grant recipients that are located in high-need areas or that commit to certain community support approaches. It would establish program reporting requirements and policies for revoking grants. It would require HHS and the Justice Department to conduct a study, within three years of enactment, on the effectiveness of funded programs and activities." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 223-206. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 452, [9/22/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll452.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/22/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/452?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8542](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8542/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Would Have Created A Grant Program For State And Local Governments To Train And Dispatch Mental Health Experts, Instead Of Police Officers, To Respond To Behavioral Health Emergencies.** According to The Washington Post, "The Mental Health Justice Act of 2022, sponsored by Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), seeks to create a grant program for states and local governments to train and dispatch mental health professionals --- instead of law enforcement officers --- to respond to emergencies that involve people with behavioral health needs." \[The Washington Post, [9/22/22](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/22/house-democrats-policing/)\]

-   **The Bill Would Have Authorized \$250 Million Annually Through FY 2027 For The Mental Health Grants.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill would authorize \$250 million annually through fiscal 2027 for the program." \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/22/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/452?8)\]
