### Bureau of Land Management

**2016: Schweikert Voted Against Barring Funds To Bureau Of Land Management And The U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement Offices.** In July 2016, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "bar\[red\] funds in the bill from being used to abolish law enforcement offices at the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service."

-   **BLM And Forest Service Employees Have Been Targets Of Violence, Including Occupations Of Their Offices.** According to Think Progress, "BLM and Forest Service employees have also been the targets of violence outside of these occupations, ranging from attempted murder to threats of physical assault. The CAP report makes clear that these agencies need more resources, not less, to adequately protect the national forests, national parks, and other public lands to which they are entrusted." \[Think Progress, [3/24/16](https://thinkprogress.org/new-bill-would-eliminate-law-enforcement-on-public-lands-despite-risks-of-violent-extremism-b8d70bbfd479#.m0b654aiw)\]

The standoff, which was originally led by brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy, came to a head after the arrest on Wednesday in Portland of their father, Cliven Bundy. On Thursday, he was charged with conspiracy, assault on a federal officer and obstruction of justice in connection with a separate 2014 standoff on federal land near his Nevada ranch." \[Reuters, [2/17/16](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oregon-militia-idUSKCN0VK05F)\]

It would recognize the need for better data collection on law enforcement officers who are assaulted, injured, or disabled in the line of duty.

As amended, it would express that local law enforcement officers who have been accused of misconduct should have certain rights in the course of investigations and encourage states to adopt a 'Bill of Rights' related to such officers\' rights."

**2020: Schweikert Voted Against The George Floyd Justice In Policing Act.** In June 2020, Schweikert voted against the House police reform bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "establish reporting and oversight requirements related to policing data and restrict the use of certain policing practices by federal law enforcement agencies and state and local agencies receiving certain federal policing grants. It would restrict a number of policing practices \[...\] including to prohibit the use of 'no-knock warrants' to execute searches in drug cases; the use of deadly force, including chokeholds, except as a 'last resort' to prevent imminent injury to an officer or another person; and the use of deadly or 'less lethal' force before exhausting reasonable alternatives, including deescalation tactics. It would prohibit racial profiling by law enforcement, authorize lawsuits regarding violations of the prohibition, and require agencies to implement racial profiling training and oversight procedures. It would require the Justice Department to establish a national police misconduct registry, and it would establish a number of reporting requirements for law enforcement agencies, including on use of force, racial profiling, officer misconduct records and routine policing practices \[...\] It would eliminate 'qualified immunity' protections for law enforcement officers by prohibiting legal defenses based on an officer acting 'in good faith' or the purported absence of 'clearly established' law. It would require federal law enforcement officers to use body cameras and dashboard cameras." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 236-181. \[House Vote 119, [6/25/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll119.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/25/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/119?2); Congressional Actions, [H.R.7120](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7120/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+7120%22%5D%7d&s=2&r=1)\]

-   **The Bill Created A National Registry To Track Police Misconduct.** According to the New York Times, "The bill would also create a national registry to track police misconduct and require law enforcement agencies to report data on the use of force, aim to force departments to eliminate the use of chokeholds, and conditions some federal grants on the adoption of anti-discrimination training and practices." \[New York Times, [6/25/20](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/us/politics/house-police-overhaul-bill.html)\]

-   **Despite Bipartisan Determination To Pass A Police Reform Bill, The Refusal To Compromise On Both Sides Will Likely Thwart Any Legislation From Being Passed This Year.** According to the New York Times, "Passage of the legislation \[...\] only underscored the depth of the stalemate in Congress over how to bring about law enforcement changes that both parties say are needed \[...\] Over two weeks ago, as protestors thronged streets in big cities and small towns across the nation, many lawmakers on Capitol Hill hoped that they would be able to bridge a previously insurmountable gulf on police reform efforts and pass legislation addressing systemic racism in law enforcement. Those hopes have rapidly fizzled, replaced by bitter recriminations after Senate Democrats refused on Wednesday even to allow the Republican bill to come up for debate, calling it 'woefully inadequate.' \[...\] Both Republicans and Democrats have insisted that the opportunity to revive policing reform efforts has not been foreclosed. But given the partisan gridlock, and with lawmakers in both chambers expected to be out of Washington for extended periods of time leading up to the November election, many of them privately concede that a compromise will be difficult to strike." \[New York Times, [6/25/20](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/us/politics/house-police-overhaul-bill.html)\]
