### Third Party Settlements

**2016: Schweikert Voted Against Exempting Settlement Agreements For Workplace Sexual Harassment From A Bill Banning Third Party Settlement Agreements Except If The Settlement Is For Restitution To An Affected Party Or Is A Direct Remedy For Harm.** In September 2016, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "exempt\[ed\] settlement agreements that would resolve a civil action or potential civil action related to work place harassment or discrimination from the bill\'s provisions that would limit settlement payments to third parties." The underlying legislation would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] settlement agreements involving the U.S. government from requiring the non-governmental party to make a payment to any party other than the U.S. government. Prohibitions would not \[have\] appl\[ied\] if the payment under the settlement is for restitution to affected parties or is a direct remedy for actual harm." The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 178 to 235. \[House Vote 485, [9/7/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll485.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/7/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/485?0); Congressional Quarterly, [9/7/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/488?15); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Certain Federal Agencies Have Used Negotiated Settlements To Fund Community Service Projects, Such As When JP Morgan Credit Against Its Settlement For By Donating To Community Redevelopment Organizations.** According to Congressional Quarterly, " Beginning in the 1980s, various federal enforcement agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), have wanted to use money from negotiated financial settlements to fund community service projects. \[...\] Beginning in 2013, the Justice Department entered into a number of agreements with large banks to settle issues surrounding the banks' mortgage practices. The settlement with JP Morgan offered the bank credit against its settlement obligations for donations to community redevelopment groups. In 2014, settlements with both Citibank and Bank of America required \$150 million in donations to housing nonprofits. These donations earned double credit against the banks' overall obligations. Meanwhile, credit for direct forms of consumer relief remained dollar-for-dollar." \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/2/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4947369/15?14)\]
