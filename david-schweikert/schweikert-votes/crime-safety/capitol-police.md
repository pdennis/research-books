# Capitol Police

### Funding

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Providing \$79.3 Million To Capitol Police, And Against Requiring Capitol Police Officers Who Interact With The Public To Use Body-Worn Cameras.** In May 2021, Schweikert voted against the Emergency Security Supplemental Appropriations Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide \$79.3 million for the Capitol Police, including specified funding for employee hazard pay and retention bonuses, the employee wellness program, agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies, protective details for members of Congress, and physical protection barriers. It would generally require Capitol Police officers who interact with the public to use body cameras while on duty." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 213-212, and was sent to the Senate and the President and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 156, [5/20/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll156.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/20/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/156?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3237](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3237/actions)\]

-   **The Bill Provided \$572 Million For Construction And Infrastructure Security Upgrades At The Capitol, Which Would Include \$100 Million For Security Screening Vestibules.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "provide \$572 million for the Architect of the Capitol for construction, operations and infrastructure security upgrades, including \$100 million for the construction of security screening vestibules." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/20/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/156?7)\]
