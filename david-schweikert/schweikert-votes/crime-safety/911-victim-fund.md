# 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund

### Catch-Up Payments

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Provide Approximately \$6 Billion For The Department Of Justice To Grant Lump-Sum "Catch-Up" Payments To 9/11 Survivors, Spouses And Dependents Eligible For Claims.** In September 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for with the Fairness for 9/11 Families Act, which would "authorize the Justice Department to issue lump-sump 'catch-up' payments to 9/11 survivors, spouses, and dependents who are eligible for claims from the Justice Department\'s Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund. The catch-up payments would be made to match proportions of payments received from the fund by other eligible family members, such as parents and non-dependent children. It would authorize such sums as necessary for the payments and, as an offset, rescind \$3 billion in unspent COVID-relief funds appropriated by the March 2020 coronavirus relief law (PL 116-136)." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 400-31. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 477, [9/30/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll477.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/30/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/477?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8987](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8987/all-actions)\]

### Catch-Up Payments And Program Expansion

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2023 Omnibus Spending Package, Which Included Funding To Ensure Continuation Of Compensation For 9/11 Victims.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against concurring with the Senate amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, which would "include provisions to address flexibility for state and local coronavirus relief funding, use of Russian asset seizures for Ukraine aid, breastfeeding workplace accommodations, compensation for 9/11 victims, aviation preparedness, ocean and land conservation programs, consumer protections, pesticide safety and lobster fishing regulations." The vote was on a motion to concur. The House concurred with the Senate amendment by a vote of 225-201, thus bill was sent to President Biden and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 549, [12/23/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll549.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/23/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/549?2); Congressional Actions, [S.Amdt. 6552](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/117th-congress/senate-amendment/6552/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2617](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617/all-actions)\]
