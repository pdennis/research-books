# 9/11 Compensation Fund

### Reauthorization

**2019: Schweikert Voted For Reauthorizing The 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund Through 2090.** In July 2019, Schweikert voted for a bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "reauthorize through fiscal 2090 the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund to compensate first responders and other individuals with health conditions caused by toxin exposure due to the attacks on September 11, 2001. It would authorize such sums as may be necessary for the fund and allow claims to be filed through Oct. 1, 2089. It would also require the reimbursement of any claims previously reduced due to insufficient funds and includes a number of modifications to fund management, including to provide exceptions to a cap for reimbursement of noneconomic damages." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 402-12, and was later signed by the President to become law. \[House Vote 474, [7/12/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll474.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/12/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/374?2https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/474); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1327](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1327/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+1327%22%5D%7d&s=2&r=1)\]

-   **The Bill Authorized Funds To Permanently Provide For Those Who Got Sick From Breathing In Toxic Air At Ground Zero After The September 11 Attacks.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill (HR 1327) will effectively make permanent the special compensation fund for those who got sick with cancer and other ailments in the attacks' aftermath, many of whom breathed toxic air for days or weeks at Ground Zero, the site of the former World Trade Center twin towers. The measure provides however much money is needed to pay all eligible claims." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5607624?16)\]

-   **The Fund Was Running Out Of Money And Needed To Be Reauthorized To Avoid Cutting Payouts For New Claimants.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The issue took on greater urgency earlier this year when it became clear the special fund set up to compensate first responders and other victims of the 2001 attacks was running low on cash and would be forced to cut payouts for new claimants." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5607624?16)\]

-   **Comedian Jon Stewart Rebuked Congress For Their Slow Pace In Moving The Legislation.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "\[comedian Jon\] Stewart and lawmakers representing the victims have expressed frustration at Congress' pace in moving legislation, even after the overseer of the victims fund, Rupa Bhattacharyya, announced in February that she would have to cut payouts to victims for lack of money." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/12/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5565216?20)\]
