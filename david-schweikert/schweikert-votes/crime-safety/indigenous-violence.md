# Violence Against Indigenous People

### Joint Commission On Reducing Violent Crime Against Indians

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Extend The Joint Commission On Reducing Violent Crime Against Indians For An Additional 18 Months And Allow The Commission To Accept Donations From Tribes, Academic Institutions And Non-Profits.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for a bill that would "extend, by 18 months, the duration of the Joint Commission on Reducing Violent Crime Against Indians and allow the commission to accept gifts and donations from tribes, academic institutions and non-profit organizations as necessary to carry out its duties." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 374-44, thus the bill was sent to President Biden and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 543, [12/22/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll543.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/22/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/543?21); Congressional Actions, [S. 5087](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/5087/all-actions)\]

-   **The Commission Seeks To Lower Violent Crimes Against Native Americans, Including Cases Of Missing Persons, Murder And Human Trafficking Against Native Americans.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "In addition to the water rights bills, the committee added to the agenda legislation (S 5087) to extend for an additional year and half a joint commission established between the departments of Interior and Justice to reduce instances of violent crimes, including missing persons, murder and human trafficking against Native Americans. The bill, which also would establish dedicate funding streams for the commission's activities, was advanced by voice vote." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/16/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/committees-20221116497114?24)\]
