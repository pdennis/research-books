### Effectively Lift The Ban On Federally Funded Needle Exchange Programs

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Effectively Lifting The Ban On Funding Needle Exchange Programs As Part Of The FY 2016 Omnibus.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted against effectively allowing federal funds for needle exchange programs. According to Vox, "In December, Congress quietly made a huge change to help combat HIV: It effectively lifted the federal funding ban on needle exchange programs, which provide clean needles --- meaning syringes that aren\'t infected with HIV --- to drug users. The change \[...\] keeps the federal funding ban on syringes themselves, but ends the ban on all other aspects of the programs --- staff, vehicles, gas, rent, and so on. Activists praised the move as an effective end to the ban, since the syringes are a very inexpensive part of needle exchange programs." The legislation was, according to Congressional Quarterly, a FY 2016 Omnibus Appropriations bill. The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill with an amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 316 to 113. The legislation was later combined with a tax extender bill. The Senate passed the larger measure and the president signed it. \[House Vote 705, [12/18/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll705.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/18/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/S/339?20); Vox, [1/6/15](http://www.vox.com/2016/1/6/10723800/congress-needle-exchange-ban); Congressional Quarterly, [12/15/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/705?20); Congressional Quarterly, [12/17/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4809119?25); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2029](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029/all-actions)\]

-   **Congress Originally Banned Funding In The Late 1980s Based On Concerns That Providing Clean Needles Could Enable More Drug Use.** According to Vox, "Congress originally imposed the ban in the late 1980s in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic of that era, based on now-disproven concerns that providing clean needles to drug addicts could enable more drug use and make drug and HIV epidemics worse. Congressional Democrats briefly lifted the ban in 2009, but Republicans put it back in place in 2011 after they took over the House of Representatives." \[Vox, [1/6/15](http://www.vox.com/2016/1/6/10723800/congress-needle-exchange-ban)\]

-   **Program Is Designed To Reduce HIV Infections From Needles.** According to Vox, "Syringe exchanges allow people to obtain clean needles for little to no cost. The idea is to get dirty needles off the streets while supplying drug users with needles that won\'t carry the risk of an HIV or hepatitis infection. These programs are proven to substantially reduce, although not eliminate, the rate of HIV infections from needles." \[Vox, [1/6/15](http://www.vox.com/2016/1/6/10723800/congress-needle-exchange-ban)\]

-   **After HIV Epidemic In Indiana, Gov. Mike Pence Allowed Needle Exchange; Nationally Worsening Heroin Problem Helped Spur Federal Lawmakers.** According to Vox, "Last year, the worst ever HIV epidemic in Indiana prompted Republican Gov. Mike Pence to allow needle exchange programs in his state. And with the worsening heroin epidemic, federal lawmakers were purportedly worried that growing addiction to the needle-injected drug could make HIV spread further." \[Vox, [1/6/15](http://www.vox.com/2016/1/6/10723800/congress-needle-exchange-ban)\]
