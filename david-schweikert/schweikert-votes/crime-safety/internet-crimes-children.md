# Internet Crimes Against Children

### Task Force Program

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Reauthorize The Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Program Through FY 2024 With \$60 Million Annually.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Providing Resources, Officers, and Technology to Eradicate Cyber Threats to Our Children Act of 2022, which would "reauthorize through fiscal 2024 the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Program, a national network of law enforcement agencies that assists state and local law enforcement in responding to technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and internet crimes against children. It would authorize \$60 million annually through fiscal 2024 for the Justice Department to carry out the program." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 421-1, thus the bill was sent to President Biden and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 510, [12/6/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll510.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/6/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/510?13); Congressional Actions, [S. 4834](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4834/all-actions)\]
