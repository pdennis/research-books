### Increasing Funding For Programs For Sexual Assault Victims

**2015: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Increasing \$3 Million For Sexual Assault Victims And \$3 Million For Missing And Exploited Children By Decreasing \$6 Million From The Justice Information Technology Account.** In June 2015, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] an additional \$3 million for sexual assault victims assistance within the Violence Against Women Prevention and Prosecution Programs account and an additional \$3 million for missing and exploited children programs in the Juvenile Justice Programs account. It would \[have\] decrease\[d\] funding for the Justice Information Technology Account by \$6 million." The underlying legislation was the FY 16 Commerce, Justice and Science appropriations bill. The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 184 to 240. \[House Vote 296, [6/3/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll296.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/3/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/296?30); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2578](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2578/all-actions)\]
