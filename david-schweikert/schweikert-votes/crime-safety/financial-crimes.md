### Money Laundering

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against An Anti-Money Laundering Bill.** In October 2019, Schweikert voted against a bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require each corporation and limited liability company to file a report with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network detailing identifiable information on its beneficial owners and require that such reports be updated annually. It would exempt from such reporting requirements certain corporate entities subject to existing disclosure laws or any company with more than 20 employees or over \$5 million in annual revenue. Among other provisions, it would establish procedures for the disclosure of ownership information by FinCEN to law enforcement agencies and establish civil and criminal penalties for violations of the bill\'s reporting requirement." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 249-173. The bill was never taken up by the Senate. \[House Vote 577, [10/22/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll577.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/22/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/577?27); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2513](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2513/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22corporate+transparency+act%22%5D%7d&s=2&r=1)\]

-   **The Bill Was Meant To Curb The Use Of Shell Companies To Hide Assets From Criminal Investigators And Tax Officials.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The anti-money laundering bill \[...\] would require corporations and limited liability companies to report beneficial ownership information to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, with a goal of curbing the use of anonymous shell companies that hide assets from criminal investigators and tax officials." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/22/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5749813?31)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Expand Geographic Targeting Orders To Combat Money Laundering To Include Electronic Transfers.** In July 2016, Schweikert voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "expand\[ed\] geographic targeting orders, issued by the Treasury Department to combat money laundering, to include all funds, including funds involved in electronic transfers." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 356 to 47. The Senate later passed an amended version, which died in the House. \[House Vote 401, [7/11/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll401.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/11/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/401?1); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5602](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5602/all-actions)\]
