# Child Support

### International Child Support

**2013: Schweikert Voted Requiring HHS Ensure That The U.S. Is In Compliance With International Treaties Dealing With Child Support.** In June 2013, Schweikert voted for legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] the Health and Human Services Department to ensure U.S. compliance with multilateral treaties regarding child support. It also would \[have\] give\[n\] states the option to require individuals in foreign countries to apply for child support enforcement services through their country's appropriate central authority." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 394 to 27. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 252, [6/18/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll252.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/18/13](http://cq.com/vote/2013/H/252?2); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1896](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1896/all-actions)\]
