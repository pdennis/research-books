### Community Re-Entry Center Grants

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Authorizing \$10 Million Annually Through FY 2026 For Grants To Community-Based Non-Profits To Establish Community Re-Entry Centers To Support Ex-Felons And Their Families And Lower Recidivism In High-Risk Areas.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the One Stop Shop Community Reentry Program Act of 2021, which would "authorize \$10 million annually through fiscal 2026 for new Justice Department grants to community-based nonprofits to establish community reentry centers to serve formerly incarcerated individuals and their families and reduce recidivism in areas with a disproportionately high number of residents who have been arrested or convicted of a criminal offense. Among other provisions, it would require grant applicants to submit plans to work with community leaders and develop needs assessment tools to identify the needs of formerly incarcerated individuals and their families and use such information to provide relevant and accessible reentry services, including to facilitate access to employment, education and vocational training, financial counseling, medical and mental health services, transportation, housing and legal assistance. It would establish program evaluation and reporting requirements and require the DOJ to prioritize applicants that seek to employ formerly convicted or incarcerated individuals. The bill would also authorize \$1.5 million annually through fiscal 2026 for DOJ grants to state, local and tribal governments to operate toll-free hotlines with text message capability that direct individuals to reentry services." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 259-167. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 492, [12/1/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll492.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/1/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/492?26); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3372](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3372/all-actions)\]
