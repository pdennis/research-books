### Regulations

**2017: Schweikert Voted Against Exempting Regulations Related To Tribal Sovereignty From The SCRUB Act, Which Would Require Agencies To Eliminate Old Rules In Order To Create New Ones.** In March 2017, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "exempt\[ed\] from the bill's provisions rules related to federal obligations to tribal governments and rules related to supporting tribal sovereignty." The underlying legislation, also according to Congressional Quarterly, "establish\[ed\] a nine-member commission to review existing federal regulations and identify regulations that should be repealed on the basis of reducing costs on the U.S. economy. The commission would identify those regulatory policies that should be repealed immediately, and would set up a 'Cut-Go' system that would require agencies to repeal existing rules to offset costs before issuing a new rule. The measure, as amended, would require the commission to review a rule or regulation's unfunded mandate, whether the rule or regulation limits or prevents government agencies from adopting technology to improve efficiency, and the rule or regulation's impact on wage growth, when determining if the rule or regulation should be repealed." The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 197 to 229. \[House Vote 111, [3/1/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll111.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/1/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/111?5); Congressional Quarterly, [1/7/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/20?12); Congressional Actions, [H.
