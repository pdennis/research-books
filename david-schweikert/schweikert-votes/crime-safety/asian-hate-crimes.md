# Asian Hate Crimes

### Condemning Georgia Shootings

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Condemning The March 16, 2021 Shooting In Georgia That Targeted Asian Businesses And Killed 7 Women, And Against Reaffirming Commitment In Combating Racism And Asian Hate Crimes.** In May 2021, Schweikert voted against a resolution which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "state that the House of Representatives condemns the 'heinous and inexcusable acts of gun violence' that killed eight people in Georgia on March 16, 2021, and any racism or sexism in the choice of the shooter to target Asian-owned businesses and kill seven women, six of whom were of Asian descent. It would also state that the House honors the memory of the victims, recognizes the 'long and difficult' healing process for affected communities, and reaffirms the commitment of the U.S. government to combat hate, bigotry, and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and to prevent similar acts in the future." The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 245-180. \[House Vote 149, [5/19/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll149.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/19/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/149?11); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 275](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/275/actions)\]
