### Suspicious Behavior Reporting

**2021: Schweikert Voted For Requiring The Department Of Homeland Security To Develop Practices For Car Rental Companies And Dealers To Report Suspicious Behavior Over The Sale Of Rental Vehicles.** In October 2021, Schweikert effectively voted for the Darren Drake Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "direct the Homeland Security Department, within one year of enactment and in consultation with law enforcement agencies, to develop and disseminate best practices for rental companies and dealers to report suspicious behavior to law enforcement agencies at the point of sale for rental vehicles that are rented for less than four months by companies with a fleet of 35 or more vehicles. It would require the best practices to include guidance on defining and identifying suspicious behavior in a manner that protects civil rights and liberties. It would require the department to submit to Congress a report on the implementation of best practices, including an assessment of impacts on efforts to protect against terrorist attacks and ways to improve coordination between the department, law enforcement agencies and rental companies." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 379-51. \[House Vote 317, [10/19/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll317.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/19/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/317?34); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4089](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4089/actions)\]
