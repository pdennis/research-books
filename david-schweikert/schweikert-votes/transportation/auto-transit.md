**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Creating New Regulations From Vehicle Safety And Recalls As Part Of A Five Year Surface Transportation Reauthorization.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted against changing vehicle recall regulations as part of a five year surface transportation reauthorization. According to Congressional Quarterly, the conference report "The agreement include\[d\] a number of provisions to enhance NHTSA's ability to order safety recalls of motor vehicles and promote consumer awareness of such recalls. \[...\] NHTSA would be required to ensure that motor vehicle safety recall information is readily accessible to the public and easy to use, and it must publicly provide detailed online guidance for consumers to submit safety complaints. \[...\] Finally, it requires that vehicle rental companies correct any problems that are the subject of a recall before the vehicle can be rented or sold, and it prohibits rental companies from disabling any safety devices in vehicles. It also expands an existing study examining the completion of safety recalls on rental cars to include rental trucks." The underlying legislation would have "reauthorize\[d\] federal-aid highway and transit programs for five years, through fiscal 2020, at increased levels." The vote was on the conference report. The House approved the legislation by a vote of 359 to 65. The Senate later passed the legislation and the president later signed the legislation. \[House Vote 673, [12/3/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll673.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/3/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/S/331?0); Congressional Quarterly, [12/3/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4799720?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 22](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/22/all-actions)\]
