### Cutting Mass Transit Funding By 40 Percent Over The Next Decade

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Cutting Mass Transit Funding By 40 Percent Over The Next Decade, As Part Of The FY 2016 Conference Report Budget Resolution** In April 2015, Schweikert voted against cutting the highway and mass transit funding by over 40 percent over the next decade as part of the FY 2016 Conference Report budget resolution. According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, "The budget cuts highway and mass transit funding by 40 percent over the next decade. Gas tax revenues for the Highway Trust Fund have fallen as fuel efficiency has risen, leaving a shortfall in the financing of highways and mass transit. Rather than finding sufficient additional financing, as Congress has routinely done in recent years, the plan shrinks needed investment in transportation infrastructure sharply in an apparent effort to limit spending to what can be supported with gasoline tax revenues over the decade." The vote was on the Conference Report; the Conference Report passed by a vote of 226 to 197. The Senate also passed the budget resolution. \[House Vote 183, [4/30/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll183.xml); Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, [6/8/15](http://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/ten-serious-flaws-in-the-congressional-budget-plan); Congressional Actions, [S.
