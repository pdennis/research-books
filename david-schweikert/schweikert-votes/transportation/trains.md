### Funding

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2016 Budget Resolution Which Recommended Terminating The TIGER Program And Eliminating Amtrak Operating Subsidies.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted against the FY 2016 budget resolution which suggested eliminating the TIGER program and Amtrak operating subsidies. According to Congressional Quarterly, the resolution "recommends terminating the TIGER competitive transportation grant program created by the 2009 stimulus law, eliminating Amtrak operating subsidies, reducing Transportation Security Administration funding and prioritizing funding for rail safety. On the mandatory side, it also suggests that airline subsidies under the Essential Air Service program be phased out." The vote was on the budget resolution. The House passed the resolution 228 to 199. The budget resolution died in the Senate, but a similar concurrent resolution did pass both Houses. \[House Vote 142, [3/25/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll142.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/23/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4648745?4); Congressional Actions, [S.
