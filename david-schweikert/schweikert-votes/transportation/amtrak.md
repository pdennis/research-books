### Funding

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against An Omnibus Spending Proposal Preventing Another Government Shutdown And Providing \$1.9 Billion For Amtrak.** In February 2019, Schweikert voted against the FY 2019 consolidated appropriations bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "This Conference Summary describes the agreement on H J Res 31, Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY 2019, which provides detailed, full-year funding for all seven remaining FY 2019 spending bills ---thereby completing the FY 2019 appropriations process. The centerpiece, Homeland Security, provides \$1.375 billion for new and replacement barriers along the U.S. border with Mexico, including 55 miles of new fencing, along with an increase of \$1.5 billion in other border security funding --- such as for new technology at ports of entry and additional Customs officers. Outside of the Homeland bill, it includes another \$1.6 billion for border security, as well as a 1.9% pay increase for federal civilian employees." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 300 to 128. The bill was later signed into law by the president. \[House Vote 87, [2/14/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll087.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/14/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5463527?7); Congressional Actions, [H. J. Res. 31](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-joint-resolution/31/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Appropriated \$1.9 Billion For Amtrak, Equal To FY 2018 Funding.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The agreement provides \$1.9 billion for Amtrak (formally the National Railroad Passenger Corporation) --- equal to 2018 funding but \$1.2 billion more than requested. Of the total provided, \$650 million is for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor operations (equal to FY 2018 and \$450 million more than requested) and \$1.3 billion is for Amtrak's National Network (equal to FY 2018 and \$754 million more than requested). The measure requires at least \$50 million be used to bring Amtrak-served facilities and stations on the Northeast Corridor into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and that another \$50 million or more be used for railroad safety technology, including positive train control, on Amtrak's National Network. The measure continues to limit overtime to \$35,000 per employee --- but it allows Amtrak's president to waive this restriction for specific employees for safety or operational efficiency reasons. Amtrak must submit to Congress a report on overtime payments made in FY 2018 and the three previous years. It directs Amtrak to discount passenger fares for veterans as it does for active duty military personnel, and to maintain a station agent at each Amtrak station that had a ticket agent in FY 2018." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/14/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5463527?7)\]

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating Amtrak Operating Grants and Capital Grants.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted for a budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555, [10/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll555.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/5/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/555?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating Funding For Amtrak.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Eliminate Amtrak Operating Grants and Capital Grants The federal government has subsidized the National Railroad Passenger Corporation - better known as Amtrak - since it was created by Congress in 1970. The railroad service is a notoriously poor fiscal manager, losing \$72 million on food and beverage service alone in 2012. But Amtrak has no incentive to improve its performance if it is able to count on the taxpayers for a bailout each year. The federal government should not force taxpayers to subsidize Amtrak, which should be privatized. Eliminating Amtrak funding beginning in FY 2018 would save taxpayers \$1.4 billion annually." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed 10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]

**2017: Schweikert Voted To Eliminate \$1.1 Billion In Amtrak Grants.** In September 2017, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "eliminate\[d\] \$1.1 billion in funding for grants to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (operating as Amtrak)." The underlying legislation was a legislative vehicle for an FY 2018 Omnibus appropriations bill. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 128 to 293. \[House Vote 449, [9/6/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll449.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/6/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/449?0); Congressional Actions, [H.

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Eliminate Funding For Amtrak Capital Grants.** In June 2015, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would eliminate funding for Amtrak capital grants. According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have "eliminate\[d\] funding for Amtrak capital grants." The underlying bill was H.R. 2577, a Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act for 2016. The vote was on the amendment and the House rejected it 139 to 286. \[House Vote 304, [6/4/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll304.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/4/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/304?8); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **May 2015: An Amtrak Train Derailed Outside Of Philadelphia, Killing 8 And Injuring 200.** According to the New York Times, "Federal regulators told Congress on Tuesday that they were still working to understand why an Amtrak train was traveling at double the designated speed when it derailed in Philadelphia last month, killing eight people and injuring about 200. \[...\] The train, en route from Washington to New York on May 12, was traveling at 106 miles per hour as it entered a curve where the speed limit was 50 m.p.h." \[New York Times, [6/2/15](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/us/cause-of-amtrak-trains-speeding-still-unknown-panel-is-told.html)\]

-   **More Than 31 Million People Used Amtrak During Fiscal Year 2014.** According to Amtrak's National Fact Sheet, "During FY 2014 (October 2013 - September 2014), Amtrak welcomed aboard nearly 31 million passengers, the largest annual total in its history. On an average day, more than 84,700 passengers ride more than 300 Amtrak trains." \[Amtrak, [Accessed 10/22/15](http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?c=Page&pagename=am%2FLayout&cid=1246041980246)\]

-   **Rep. Brooks (R-AL): The Amendment Would Make Amtrak Operate In The Black And Run More Efficiently, While Saving The U.S. Money.** In a floor speech, Rep. Brooks said, "It is in this setting that I beseech this House of Representatives to be financially responsible by supporting my amendment that eliminates Federal Government operating subsidies of Amtrak, thus forcing Amtrak to operate in the black. How bad is the Amtrak subsidy problem? The Congressional Research Service reports that, from 1971 to 2015, Federal Amtrak subsidies totaled \$78 billion in constant 2015 dollars. In fiscal year 2014, Amtrak had a net loss of \$1.1 billion. Who paid for that loss? America\'s children and grandchildren, that is who. How so? It is because America does not have the money and had to borrow every penny of that \$1.1 billion, thus burdening Americans for generations to come. Mr. Chairman, a business that relies on subsidies and tax dollars to cover losses has little incentive to operate efficiently or effectively or, for that matter, as safely as it should." \[Congressional Record, [6/3/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3817-1)\]

-   **Rep. Price (D-NC): The Amendment Would "End Intercity Passenger Rail" For The U.S.** In a floor speech, Rep. Price said, "Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment which, purely and simply, would end intercity passenger rail for our Nation. I remind colleagues, there is not a single mode of transportation in this country that is not subsidized, contrary to what we have just heard." \[Congressional Record, [6/3/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3817-1)\]

-   **Rep. Brown (D-FL): The Amendment Would Eliminate 2,000 Jobs And Jeopardize The Economies Of Community Across America.** In a floor speech, Rep. Brown said, "The funding cuts proposed in this amendment would simply force Amtrak to shut down, strand millions of rail passengers, disrupt commuter operations, add to our already congested roads and airports, eliminate over 20,000 jobs nationwide, and jeopardize local economies and businesses that depend on Amtrak\'s service." \[Congressional Record, [6/3/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3817-1)\]

The underlying budget resolution would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] for \$2.804 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2016, not including off-budget accounts. The substitute would call for reducing spending by \$7.1 trillion over 10 years compared to the Congressional Budget Office baseline." The vote was on the substitute amendment to a Budget Resolution.

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Reauthorizing Amtrak.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted against reauthorizing Amtrak. According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill would have "reauthorize\[d\] the Amtrak through fiscal 2019, and restructure funding according to Amtrak's major lines of business.

It also would authorize \$300 million per year over four years for capital grants. The bill would require Amtrak to annually develop a detailed five-year capital and operating plan and examine the criteria it should use in determining what long-distance routes to service. It would require the development of a five-year capital investment plan with affected states for Amtrak\'s northeast corridor while creating a new federal-state partnership to finance corridor improvement projects." The vote was on passage. The House passed the measure by a vote of 316 to 101. The Senate took no substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 112, [3/4/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll112.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/4/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/112?101); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 749](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/749/all-actions)\]

-   **Statement Of Administration Policy: While The Administration Supports The Measure, It Does Not "Contain Adequate Railroad Safety Provisions."** According to a Statement of Administration Policy, "The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 749, which aligns with the Administration\'s goals of driving improved performance at Amtrak through accountability and encouraging States\' participation in planning and funding improvements to passenger rail corridors. The legislation does not, however, contain adequate railroad safety provisions nor provide the level of resources, long-term certainty, and additional organizational reforms that are included in the Administration's GROW AMERICA proposal to support a high performance rail system." \[Statement of Administration Policy, [3/2/15](http://www.cq.com/pdf/4634523.pdf)\]

-   **Amendment's Sponsor Argued That Approving It Would "Send A Message To Amtrak Leadership" That Congress Demanded "Real, Honest Reform."** According to the Congressional Record, Rep. Paul Broun (R-GA), the amendment's sponsor, said, "In offering my last amendment \[which would have cut all \$340 million in federal funding for Amtrak operating grants\], I laid out a number of reasons why Amtrak has failed to be a good steward of taxpayers' money. I understand that many of my colleagues might not want to fully defund this entity, so I am now asking that we join together and send a message to Amtrak leadership, a smaller message, but a strong one nonetheless. I am asking my colleagues to tell Amtrak that we will not continue to reward bad behavior and that, when we ask for reform, we expect real reform to begin and take place\--not fuzzy numbers, not misleading reports, not sky-high employee salaries, but real, honest reform. Amtrak has struggled for way too long under the status quo. It is time to send them a message." \[Congressional Record, [6/9/14](https://beta.congress.gov/crec/2014/06/09/CREC-2014-06-09-pt1-PgH5077-6.pdf#page=19); Congressional Record, [6/9/14](https://beta.congress.gov/crec/2014/06/09/CREC-2014-06-09-pt1-PgH5077-6.pdf#page=20)\]

-   **Amendment Opponent Said That Because The Underlying Bill Fully Covered Amtrak's Expected Operating Losses, The Proposed Cut Could Disrupt Service And Operations Throughout The System.** According to the Congressional Record, House Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee chairman Tom Latham (R-IA) said, "The fact of the matter is the bill provides \$340 billion in operating grants to Amtrak, which will fully cover their operating losses. If in fact the amendment were put in place, there could very easily be interruptions of service in the Northeast or throughout the system, and it could cause real problems as far as the operations itself, obviously, of Amtrak." \[Congressional Record, [6/9/14](https://beta.congress.gov/crec/2014/06/09/CREC-2014-06-09-pt1-PgH5077-6.pdf#page=20)\]

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Eliminate Federal Funding For Amtrak Operations And Capital Expenses.** In April 2014, Schweikert voted for the Republican Study Committee's proposed budget resolution for fiscal years 2015 to 2024. According to the Republican Study Committee's budget, "Eliminate AMTRAK Operating Grants and Capital Grants. The federal government has subsidized the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (better known as AMTRAK) since it was created by Congress in 1970. The railroad service is notoriously a poor fiscal manager, losing \$72 million on food and beverage service alone in 2012. But AMTRAK has no incentive to improve its performance if it knows that it will be able to count on the taxpayers for a bailout each year. The federal government should not force the taxpayers to subsidize AMTRAK, which should be privatized. Eliminating AMTRAK Operating grants beginning in FY2015 could save \$340 million per year, while eliminating AMTRAK Capital grants beginning in FY2015 could save \$1.05 billion per year." The House considered the RSC budget as a substitute amendment to House Republicans' FY 2015 budget resolution; the amendment was rejected by a vote of 133 to 291. \[House Vote 175, [4/10/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll175.xml); Republican Study Committee, [4/7/14](http://rsc.woodall.house.gov/uploadedfiles/the_budget.pdf); Congressional Actions, [H.
