### Funding

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Eliminate The Transportation Alternatives Program, Which Includes Funding For Local Bike Path Projects.** In April 2014, Schweikert voted for the Republican Study Committee's proposed budget resolution for fiscal years 2015 to 2024. According to the Republican Study Committee, "Eliminate Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP). The TAP provides federal funding for a number of local alternative transportation projects, including bike paths, trails, and scenic overlooks. These types of transportation projects are not the responsibility of the federal government. Eliminating the TAP would save taxpayers \$820 million per year." The House considered the RSC budget as a substitute amendment to House Republicans' FY 2015 budget resolution; the amendment was rejected by a vote of 133 to 291. \[House Vote 175, [4/10/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll175.xml); Republican Study Committee, [4/7/14](http://rsc.woodall.house.gov/uploadedfiles/the_budget.pdf); Congressional Actions, [H.
