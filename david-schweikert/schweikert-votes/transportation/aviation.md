### Additional DCA Flight Slots

**2023: Schweikert Voted For An Amendment That Would Have Added 7 New Roundtrip Slots At Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.** In July 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for an amendment to the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act, which would "add seven new roundtrip in-and-beyond perimeter slots at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport split between the seven airlines servicing the airport." The vote was on the adoption of an amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 205 to 229. \[House Vote 357, [7/19/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll357.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/19/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/357?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3935](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3935/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 283](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/283/actions?s=a&r=7)\]

-   **The Amendment Would Have Added A Total Of 14 Flights To The Washington National Airport, Both Inside And Outside The Perimeter.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The chamber will also vote on an amendment from Rep. Burgess Owens, R-Utah, that would add 14 total flights to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, an issue centering around a rule Congress set in the 1960s that largely limits the airport to flights within 1,250 miles with some exemptions. The amendment would allow added flights to destinations both inside and outside the perimeter." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/19/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7797703?12&srcpage=home&srcsec=following)\]

-   **The Amendment Centered Around A 1960s Regulation That Limits Flights Within 1,250 With Some Exceptions.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The contentious amendment centered around a rule Congress set in the 1960s that largely limits the airport to flights within 1,250 miles with some exemptions." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/20/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7798266?11)\]

-   **The Amendment Highlighted Geographical Lines Among Members, With Lawmakers Outside Of The DCA Parameter Wanting Exemptions While Lawmakers Within The Parameter Argued That Exemptions Would Overcrowd Airports And Impact Business Of Nearby Airports.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The amendment garnered a mixed bag of support from Democrats and Republicans, highlighting how the issue has split members along geographical lines rather than partisan ones. Lawmakers from outside of the perimeter, such as Utah, have been pushing to add exemptions in the FAA bill, while some within the perimeter say more exemptions would overcrowd the already at-capacity airport and siphon business away from other nearby airports, like Dulles International Airport." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/20/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7798266?11)\]

The commission would identify those regulatory policies that should be repealed immediately, and would set up a 'Cut-Go' system that would require agencies to repeal existing rules to offset costs before issuing a new rule. The measure, as amended, would require the commission to review a rule or regulation's unfunded mandate, whether the rule or regulation limits or prevents government agencies from adopting technology to improve efficiency, and the rule or regulation's impact on wage growth, when determining if the rule or regulation should be repealed." The vote was on the amendment.
