**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Requiring The GAO To Conduct A Study Of Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) Brake Systems As Part Of A Five Year Surface Transportation Reauthorization.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted against studying ECP brake systems as part of a five year surface transportation reauthorization. According to Congressional Quarterly, the conference report would have "require\[d\] GAO to conduct an independent evaluation of electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brake systems, including the safety benefits relative to conventional brakes and to other braking technologies or systems. The Transportation Department must have the National Academy of Sciences test the emergency braking capability of ECP brake systems and the department would use the testing results to determine whether to retain or repeal the ECP brake requirements contained in the PHMSA\'s May 2015 tank car rule." The vote was on the conference report. The House approved the legislation by a vote of 359 to 65. The Senate later passed the legislation and the president later signed the legislation. \[House Vote 673, [12/3/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll673.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/3/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/S/331?0); Congressional Quarterly, [12/3/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4799720?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 22](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/22/all-actions)\]

-   **Rule Applied To High-Hazard Flammable Unit Trains By Requiring Them To Operate With An Electronically Controlled Pneumatic Braking System By 2021.** According to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, "The rule requires HHFTs \[high-hazard flammable trains\] to have in place a functioning two-way end-of-train (EOT) device or a distributed power (DP) braking system. Trains meeting the definition of a 'high-hazard flammable unit train,' or HHFUT (a single train with 70 or more tank cars loaded with Class 3 flammable liquids), with at least one tank car with Packing Group I materials, must be operated with an electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) braking system by January 1, 2021. All other HHFUTs must have ECP braking systems installed after 2023. This important, service-proven technology has been operated successfully for years in certain services in the United States, Australia, and elsewhere." \[Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, [5/1/15](http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/DOT-Announces-Final-Rule-to-Strengthen-Safe-Transportation-of-Flammable-Liquids-by-Rail)\]

### Amtrak

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Reauthorizing The National Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) Through FY 2020 As Part Of A Five Year Surface Transportation Reauthorization.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted against reauthorizing Amtrak as part of a five year surface transportation reauthorization. According to Congressional Quarterly, the conference report would have "reauthorize\[d\] the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) for five years, through FY 2020, and it restructures funding according to Amtrak's major lines of business (e.g., Northeast Corridor) in order to provide greater transparency and accountability regarding the costs and revenues of its different business lines." The underlying legislation would have "reauthorize\[d\] federal-aid highway and transit programs for five years, through fiscal 2020, at increased levels." The vote was on the conference report. The House approved the legislation by a vote of 359 to 65. The Senate later passed the legislation and the president later signed the legislation. \[House Vote 673, [12/3/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll673.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/3/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/S/331?0); Congressional Quarterly, [12/3/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4799720?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 22](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/22/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Requires Amtrak To Eliminate Loss From The Sale Of Food And Beverages.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The agreement requires Amtrak to eliminate losses from the sale of food and beverages, and it provides that five years after enactment no federal funding will be used to cover the operating loss of food and beverage service. Under the measure, Amtrak within 90 days of enactment must develop a plan to eliminate the operating loss. The plan must consider cost management and revenue generation, including scheduling optimization; on-board logistics; product development and supply chain efficiencies; and ticket revenue allocation. It also must ensure that no employees lose their employment as a result of the plan. The plan must be submitted to Congress within 120 days of enactment and be updated annually thereafter for the next five years." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/3/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4799720?3)\]
