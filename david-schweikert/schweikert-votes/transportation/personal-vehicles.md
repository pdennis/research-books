**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Requiring The NHTSA To Conduct A Study On Marijuana-Impaired Driving As Part Of A Five Year Surface Transportation Reauthorization.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted against studying marijuana-impaired driving as part of a five year surface transportation reauthorization. According to Congressional Quarterly, the conference report would have "require\[d\] NHTSA to conduct a study on marijuana-impaired driving and whether it is feasible to establish an impairment standard that could reduce vehicle accidents caused by such driving." The underlying legislation would have "reauthorize\[d\] federal-aid highway and transit programs for five years, through fiscal 2020, at increased levels." The vote was on the conference report. The House approved the legislation by a vote of 359 to 65. The Senate later passed the legislation and the president later signed the legislation. \[House Vote 673, [12/3/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll673.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/3/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/S/331?0); Congressional Quarterly, [12/3/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4799720?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 22](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/22/all-actions)\]
