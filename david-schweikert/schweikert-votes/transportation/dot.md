### Advanced Air Mobility Infrastructure

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Require The Transportation Department To Form An Interagency Working Group To Advance The Development Of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Systems, Specifically Passenger Aircraft, And Develop An AAM National Strategy.** In June 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Advanced Air Mobility Coordination and Leadership Act, which would "require the Transportation Department to establish an interagency working group to coordinate efforts related to advancing the development of advanced air mobility (AAM) systems in the United States, particularly passenger aircraft. It would require the working group to develop and submit to Congress an AAM national strategy, including recommendations regarding the safety, operations, infrastructure, security, air traffic concepts and federal investment or actions needed to support the evolution of early AAM, as well as a plan detailing the responsibilities of federal, state and local governments to implement the recommendations. In preparing the strategy, it would require the working group to examine, among other factors, air traffic management and safety concepts relevant to higher levels of traffic density; existing federal programs that could be leveraged to advance the AAM industry; infrastructure needed to support expanded operations of AAM; and steps to ensure a robust domestic supply chain." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 380-30, thus the bill was sent to the President. \[House Vote 268, [6/14/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll268.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/14/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/268?2); Congressional Actions, [S. 516](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/516/actions)\]

The restriction affects a portion of the funds slated for the federal highway program and public transit programs, for example." \[CNN, [3/9/22](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/politics/government-omnibus-spending-bill-2022/index.html)\]

-   **Congressman Rick Larsen (D) Argued The Amendment Would Hinder The Original Intent Of The Aircraft Technology Grants To Help State, Local And Tribal Governments.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Another amendment from Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., adopted in a 220-215 vote, would require the Transportation Department, in the process of prioritizing awarding grants under the Advanced Air Mobility Infrastructure Pilot Program, to also prioritize eligible entities that collaborate with the Defense Department or National Guard. Larsen asked members to oppose Huizenga\'s amendment earlier Wednesday, saying the language would take away from the original intent of the provision to help state, local and tribal governments to be a part of the future of aircraft technology. The pilot program language in the underlying bill comes from Larsen, who introduced a similar version in the 117th Congress that passed the House but was not considered in the Senate." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/20/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7798266?7)\]
