### Defense Department

**2023: Schweikert Effectively Voted To Repeal A 2022 Memorandum Regarding Traveling For Reproductive Care.** In September 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the "motion to instruct conferees on the part of the House to disagree to section 716, which would repeal an October 2022 Defense Department memorandum concerning traveling for reproductive health care." The vote was on a motion to instruct conferees. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 205 to 214. \[House Vote 400, [9/20/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll400.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/20/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/400?5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2670](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2670/all-actions)\]

-   **The 2022 Memorandum Ensured Service Members And Their Families Access To Reproductive Care.** According to the Congressional Research Service, "On October 20, 2022, the Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum directing actions to ensure that servicemembers and their families 'can access reproductive health care and \[DOD\] health care providers can operate effectively.' The memo directed the department to establish travel and transportation allowances for servicemembers and their dependents to obtain noncovered reproductive health care that is unavailable in the 'local area of a Service member's permanent duty station,' and establish a reimbursement program to assist a DOD health care provider with obtaining a professional license in another state 'in order to support the performance of their official duties.' Section 716 would repeal the October 20, 2022, DOD memorandum and prohibit DOD from using funds to implement the memorandum or a potential successor memorandum. The provision would also amend 10 U.S.C. §1093 to prohibit the Secretary of Defense from paying for or reimbursing fees or expenses for DOD health care providers to obtain a health care license in a state for the purpose of providing abortion services." \[Congressional Research Service, [9/6/23](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12236#:~:text=On October 20%2C 2022%2C the,travel and transportation allowances for)\]
