### Congressional Investigation Into Fetal Tissue

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Authorize An Additional \$800,000 To The Congressional Committee Investigating Planned Parenthood.** In December 2016, Schweikert voted for a resolution that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "allow\[ed\] the House Energy and Commerce Committee to spend an additional \$800,000 during the remainder of the 114th Congress." Also according to Congressional Quarterly, the resolution specifically "provide\[d\] more money to the panel investigating the alleged sale of fetal tissue." The vote was on the resolution. The House agreed to the resolution by a vote of 234 to 181. \[House Vote 595, [12/1/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll595.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/1/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/595?64); Congressional Quarterly, [12/1/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4995593?5); Congressional Actions, [H. Res. 933](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-resolution/933/actions)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Create A Congressional Subcommittee To Investigative Issues Related To Fetal Tissue Donation.** In October 2015, Schweikert voted to create a Congressional subcommittee to investigate issues related to fetal tissue donation. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "establish\[ed\] a select investigative subcommittee under the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The panel would be responsible for investigating and reporting on issues related to fetal tissue donation, fetal tissue procurement, federal funding for abortion services, and late-term abortions. The panel would be composed, as amended, of 15 members selected by the speaker and minority leader, with no more than six Democrats." The vote was on the legislation. The House passed the bill by a vote of 242 to 184. The legislation, not needing Senate approval or a presidential signature, created the committee. \[House Vote 538, [10/7/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll538.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/7/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/538?34); The Hill, [10/7/15](http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/256254-house-creates-panel-to-investigate-planned-parenthood); Congressional Actions, [H. Res. 461](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-resolution/461/all-actions)\]

-   **Planned Parenthood Was Under Investigation Over Videos Allegedly Showing Planned Parenthood Breaking Fetal Tissue Regulations.** According to MSNBC, "Several House committees are investigating Planned Parenthood after the release of secretly-recorded videos from an anti-abortion group, showing Planned Parenthood employees and current and former employees of a fetal tissue procurement firm. The group behind them says they show Planned Parenthood breaking laws regulating fetal tissue donation for the purpose of medical research -- specifically, profiting off the tissue and altering procedures to obtain intact parts -- which Planned Parenthood denies. None of the federal funding in question goes to abortion or to fetal tissue donation programs, although the National Institutes of Health does fund research on fetal tissue." \[MSNBC, [9/18/15](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/house-votes-defund-planned-parenthood)\]

### Funding

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment To The FY 2020 Minibus That Prohibited The Convening Of An Ethics Advisory Board On Research Projects That Use Human Fetal Tissue.** In June 2019, Schweikert voted against an amendment to the FY 2020 minibus that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit use of funds made available by the bill to convene an ethics advisory board on research grants and projects that propose the use of human fetal tissue." The vote was on adoption of the amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 225-193. \[House Vote 321, [6/13/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll321.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/13/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/321?1); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 338](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/116th-congress/house-amendment/338/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2740](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2740/all-actions)\]

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Effectively Defunding Planned Parenthood.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted for a budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555, [10/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll555.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/5/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/555?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

Res. 71](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/71/all-actions)\]

-   **Budget Called For Defunding Abortion Providers.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Prohibit Federal Funds from Going to Entities that Provide Abortions The federal government should not fund entities that provide abortion services. This budget ensures that no taxpayer dollars flow to entities that provide abortions." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed 10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating All Title X Funding For Abortion Providers.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Eliminate Title X Family Planning Funding Title X, or the family planning federal grant program, provides abortion providers with federal funds to terminate pregnancies and end the lives of thousands of innocent babies. This money has been used by abortion providers, like Planned Parenthood, to not only underwrite the abortion industry, but it has also been used in support of organizations that dismember and sell fetal body parts. Planned Parenthood is the largest recipient of Title X grants, which are intended to fund valuable health services for low-income women, but instead are used by abortion providers to put the safety of women and their unborn babies in danger.376 Eliminating Title X would save \$286 million per year." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed 10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The House GOP's FY 2018 Omnibus That Defunded Planned Parenthood.** In September 2017, Schweikert voted for an FY 2018 Omnibus appropriations bill that. According to The Hill, "The House on Thursday completed its work on the annual appropriations bills for 2018, ahead of expected negotiations at the end of this year to keep the government funded. By a vote of 211-198, the House passed a \$1.2 trillion package of spending bills to fund wide swaths of the federal government, ranging from the Department of Homeland Security to the Environmental Protection Agency. \[...\] The package included eight new bills, plus four previously passed appropriations bills that advanced through the House in July. Regular order for appropriations typically involved passing each of the bills individually, not in groups of 4 or 8. \[...\] Together, the bills appropriate \$621.5 billion for defense spending and \$511 billion for nondefense discretionary spending. It also devotes another \$87 billion in Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) funding, which does not count toward budget cuts. Of that, \$75 billion went to defense, \$12 billion to nondefense." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 211 to 198. The Senate took no substantive action on the overall legislation. \[House Vote 528, [9/14/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll528.xml); The Hill, [9/14/17](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/350670-house-passes-12t-government-funding-package-for-2018); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3354](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3354/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Defunded Planned Parenthood.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Finally, the measure prohibits funding for Planned Parenthood and HHS Title X family planning programs; prohibits the use of funds to administer or further implement the 2010 health care overhaul (the Affordable Care Act, or ACA), including by prohibiting the funding of ACA navigators; and it includes the text of the Conscience Protection Act, which prohibits all levels of government from penalizing, retaliating against or otherwise discriminating against a health care provider because the provider does not provide or sponsor abortion coverage." \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/8/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5173142/14?9&search=wcZW0VxZ)\]

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The American Health Care Act That Would Have In Part Prohibited Federal Funding To Planned Parenthood.** In May 2017, Schweikert voted for the American Health Care Act which would have significantly repealed portions of the Affordable Care Act by cutting Medicaid, cutting taxes on the rich, removing safeguard for pre-existing conditions and defunding Planned Parenthood. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "prohibit\[ed\] federal funding to any entity, such as Planned Parenthood, that performs abortions and receives more than \$350 million a year in Medicaid funds." The overall legislation would have in part, also according to Congressional Quarterly, "ma\[d\]e extensive changes to the 2010 health care overhaul law, by effectively repealing the individual and employer mandates as well as most of the taxes that finance the current system. It would \[have\], in 2020, convert\[ed\] Medicaid into a capped entitlement that would provide\[d\] fixed federal payments to states and end\[ed\] additional federal funding for the 2010 law's joint federal-state Medicaid expansion. \[...\] It would \[have\] allow\[ed\] states to receive waivers to exempt insurers from having to provide certain minimum benefits." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 217 to 213. The bill, in modified forms, died in the Senate. \[House Vote 256, [5/4/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll256.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/4/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/256?1); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1628](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628/all-actions)\]

**2017: Schweikert Voted To Disapprove A Rule That Would Have Effectively Withheld Title X Funds To States That Restrict Title X Funds To Planned Parenthood.** In February 2017, Schweikert voted for disapproving the HHS rule related to Title X funding compliance via the Congressional Review Act. According to Congressional Quarterly, "This resolution disapproves the rule issued by the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) on Dec. 19, 2016, that modifies eligibility requirements for Title X grants for family planning services to specify that states and other entities awarding funds cannot prohibit a health care provider from participating for reasons other than its ability to provide Title X services (which effectively threatens to withhold Title X money from states that restrict participation by Planned Parenthood). The measure provides that the rule (formally titled Compliance With Title X Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting Subrecipients) would have no force or effect." The vote was on the resolution. The House adopted the legislation by a vote of 230 to 188. The legislation later became law. \[House Vote 99, [2/16/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll099.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/10/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5040651/11?105&search=b6LCd0LZ); Congressional Actions, [H. J. Res. 43](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/43/all-actions)\]

-   **HHS Rule Required That States Can Only Deny Funding For A Group Based On Its Ability To Provide Title X Services.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "On Dec. 19, 2016, HHS finalized a rule modifying eligibility requirements for Title X grants for family planning services, which specified that no state or other recipient distributing funds can prohibit an entity from participating and receiving funds for reasons other than its ability to provide Title X services. If states or other entities are found to not be in compliance, HHS could discontinue its funding, subject to administrative appeals and a recoupment and re-awarding of funds. The rule effectively threatens to withhold Title X funds from states that have restrictions against participation by Planned Parenthood. The final rule became effective on Jan. 18, 2017." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/10/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5040651/11?105&search=b6LCd0LZ)\]

-   **Some States Have Attempted To Defund A Portion Of Planned Parenthood Funding By Denying Funds Through Title X.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Within the past few years, 13 states have taken actions to restrict participation by certain providers under the Title X program --- most prominently, Planned Parenthood. HHS officials in the Obama administration argued that these actions were motivated by politics and not the provider\'s ability to provide Title X services, noting that the restrictions caused limitations in the geographic distribution of services. Some states have implemented a tiered approach to distribute Title X funds that gives preference to comprehensive primary care providers or community health centers, while others have explicitly prohibited specific providers from being eligible to receive Title X funds. Litigation concerning these restrictions has led to inconsistency across states in how Title X funds are distributed." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/10/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5040651/11?105&search=b6LCd0LZ)\]

-   **Title X Family Planning Is The Only Federal Grant Program Dedicated To Family Planning; Program Helps About 4 Million People Annually, Including Through Pregnancy Testing And STD Screening.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Title X Family Planning Program within the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) was enacted in 1970 as part of the Public Health Service Act and remains the only federal program focused solely on providing family planning services. An estimated 4 million individuals each year receive services through thousands of Title X-funded health centers across the country, including contraceptive services, pregnancy testing and counseling, preconception health services, screening for sexually transmitted diseases and certain cancer screenings." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/10/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5040651/11?105&search=b6LCd0LZ)\]

-   **Title X Funds Cannot Be Used To Fund Abortion, But Organizations That Provide Abortion Services Can Receive Funding.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Current law bars the use of Title X funds for abortion, but it allows states that receive grants to award funds to nonprofits and other entities to serve as providers for the covered family planning services. In some states, Title X service providers include members of Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc., a network of clinics that provide contraception and preventive health care for women but which is also the largest provider of abortion services in the nation." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/10/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5040651/11?105&search=b6LCd0LZ)\]

-   **Planned Parenthood Receives About \$60 Million Annually From Title X Out Of \$450 Million Annually From The Federal Government.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "For years, abortion opponents have been trying to eliminate or restrict federal funding for Planned Parenthood. The organization receives roughly \$450 million in federal funds each year, with \$390 million coming from Medicaid reimbursements and \$60 million coming from Title X." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/10/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5040651/11?105&search=b6LCd0LZ)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Override President Obama's Veto Of A Bill That Defunded Planned Parenthood.** In February 2015, Schweikert voted to override President Obama's veto of a bill that according to Congressional Quarterly, would have "scrap\[ed\] in 2018 the law\'s Medicaid expansion, as well as subsidies to help individuals buy coverage through the insurance exchanges." Additionally, according to Congressional Quarterly the bill would have "repeal\[ed\] portions of the 2010 health care law and block\[ed\] federal funding for Planned Parenthood for one year. As amended, the bill would zero-out the law's penalties for noncompliance with the law's requirements for most individuals to obtain health coverage and employers to offer health insurance." The vote was on a veto override, which required a two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House, which was 285 in the House. The House rejected the veto override by a vote of 241 to 186. \[House Vote 53, [2/2/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll053.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/3/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/S/329); Real Clear Politics, [12/4/15](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/12/04/senate_oks_obamacare_repeal_despite_veto_threat_128928.html); Congressional Quarterly, [2/2/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/53?19); NBC News, [1/8/15](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/obama-vetoes-obamacare-repeal-bill-n492881); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3762](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3762/all-actions)\]

-   **November 27, 2015: Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood Attacked.** According to the New York Times, "A gun battle erupted inside a Planned Parenthood center here on Friday when a man armed with an assault-style rifle opened fire and began shooting at officers as they rushed to the scene. The authorities reported that three people were killed, a police officer and two civilians, and nine were wounded before the suspect finally surrendered more than five hours after the first shots were fired. A police official in Colorado Springs identified the man in custody as Robert Lewis Dear." \[New York Times, [11/27/15](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/28/us/colorado-planned-parenthood-shooting.html?_r=0)\]

-   **Prior To The Vote, Planned Parenthood Had Come Under Scrutiny Over A Series Of Videos That Appears To Show Planned Parenthood Discussing The Price Of Selling Fetal Tissue For Medical Research.** According to The Hill, "Republicans fell short of the 60 votes needed to move forward with the legislation, which was fast-tracked to the floor after the release of undercover videos that show Planned Parenthood officials discussing fetal tissue from abortion. \[...\] The Planned Parenthood debate was stirred by a series of undercover videos that show officials with the group discussing the price of fetal tissue for medical research. While Planned Parenthood notes the officials are discussing compensation for the sales rather than profit, the videos have put the group on the defensive and prompted it to hire a crisis communications firm. \[The Hill, [8/3/15](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/250140-senate-shoots-down-measure-to-defund-planned-parenthood)\]

According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "amend\[ed\] title XIX of the Social Security act to allow states to exclude medical providers who perform abortions from the state\'s Medicaid contracts. The bill would \[have\] expand\[ed\] the exceptions for which a state is not required to provide Medicaid reimbursements, allowing states to deny non-abortion health care reimbursements to medical providers such as Planned Parenthood." The vote was on the bill. The House passed the bill by a vote of 236 to 193.

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Defund Planned Parenthood For One Year Unless It Ceased Offering Abortion Services.** In September 2015, Schweikert voted for defunding Planned Parenthood for one year. According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill would have "bar\[red\], for one year, federal funding for Planned Parenthood and its affiliates unless they certify that, during that period, they will not perform abortions or provide funds to other entities that perform abortions. The prohibition would apply to all federal funds, including Medicaid. The bill would provide exceptions for abortions provided in the case of rape, incest, or threat to the life of the mother. As amended, the bill would effectively redirect funds from Planned Parenthood to the community health center program; specifically, it would appropriate \$235 million for community health centers, in addition to any other funds available to the program." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 241 to 187.

-   **Planned Parenthood Was Under Investigation Over Videos Allegedly Showing Planned Parenthood Breaking Fetal Tissue Regulations.** According to MSNBC, "Several House committees are investigating Planned Parenthood after the release of secretly-recorded videos from an anti-abortion group, showing Planned Parenthood employees and current and former employees of a fetal tissue procurement firm. The group behind them says they show Planned Parenthood breaking laws regulating fetal tissue donation for the purpose of medical research -- specifically, profiting off the tissue and altering procedures to obtain intact parts -- which Planned Parenthood denies.

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Defund Planned Parenthood As Part Of The FY 2016 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted for defunding Planned Parenthood. According to the Republican Study Committee, the budget would "ensures\[ed\] that no taxpayer dollars flow to entities that provide abortions." The underlying budget resolution would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] for \$2.804 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2016, not including off-budget accounts. The substitute would call for reducing spending by \$7.1 trillion over 10 years compared to the Congressional Budget Office baseline." The vote was on the substitute amendment to a Budget Resolution. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 132 to 294. \[House Vote 138, [3/25/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll138.xml); Republican Study Committee, [FY 2016 Budget](http://rsc.flores.house.gov/files/Initiatives/rsc-budget.pdf); Congressional Quarterly, [3/25/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/138?23); Congress.gov, [H.

### Zika Funding Bill That Explicitly Excluding Funding For Abortion

**2016: Schweikert Voted For An FY 2017 Military Construction And Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill Which Also Provided \$1.1 Billion In Zika Funding, \$800 Million Less Than Requested While Also Stipulating That No Funding Could Be Used To Pay For Abortions.** In June 2016, Schweikert voted for an FY 2017 military construction and veterans affairs conference report which would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] \$82.5 billion in fiscal 2017 appropriations for the Veterans Affairs Department, military construction and military housing and would provide \$1.1 billion in funding to combat the Zika virus with about \$750 million in offsets." The vote was on the conference report. The House agreed to the legislation by a vote of 239 to 171. The Senate later failed to invoke cloture on the conference report. \[House Vote 342, [6/23/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll342.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/28/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/S/112?38); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2577](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2577/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Required That No Zika Funding Could Be Used To Pay For Abortions.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure requires that the Zika funding provided be subject to restrictions on appropriations included in the FY 2016 omnibus appropriations act (PL 114-113), which included a prohibition on the use of funds to pay for abortions. (Under federal law, U.S. foreign aid funding may not be used by other nations or organizations to pay for abortions. Some women's health groups have urged the Obama administration to use its executive authority to reinterpret the prohibition so that federal funds could be used to fund the abortions of women who contracted Zika and fear giving birth to babies with microcephaly.)" \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/23/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4916665?14)\]

-   **Legislation Included \$95 Million For The Social Services Block Grant Which Would Have Excluded Family Planning Services Such As The Puerto Rico Affiliate Of Planned Parenthood.** According to ABC News, "The bill wouldn't have directly provided funds for private family planning organizations, but Republican Senate aides noted that it would have contained \$95 million for public health departments, hospitals and public health plan reimbursement through the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) program. Republicans said funding through the SSBG would have allowed each state or territory the maximum flexibility to direct money wherever it is most needed. In the U.S., the virus is expected to have the biggest impact in Puerto Rico, and \$40 million of the funding would have gone to 20 community health centers there. \[...\] A Senate Democratic aide said the initial Senate version of the bill, which had bipartisan support, contained a more workable proposal: funding health care services through the Department of Health and Human Services' Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant program, which the aide said more directly assists women and babies, the most critical populations to reach in the Zika crisis. \[...\] According to the aide, the bill would have made access to contraceptives more difficult for women, especially in Puerto Rico, because the Senate bill would have structured its SSBG funds to exclude private health care agencies like Planned Parenthood. 'Eligible providers could only be public health departments, hospitals and entities reimbursed by public health plans. This would make access to contraceptive and prenatal services more difficult, especially for women in Puerto Rico,' the aide said." \[ABC News, [6/28/16](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-zika-bill-falls-largely-planned-parenthood-objections/story?id=40193006)\]

-   **Democrats Claimed That Excluding Planned Parenthood From Funding For A Public Health Crisis Impacting Pregnant Women Was Unreasonable.** According to the Wall Street Journal, "Senate Democrats blocked a spending bill that includes \$1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus---saying the measure unreasonably excludes Planned Parenthood Federation of America from money for a public health crisis that impacts pregnant women. \[...\] Democrats say that by excluding Planned Parenthood from funding and adding other provisions they oppose, Republicans could delay the funding well into the mosquito season and leave only a small window to act before Congress leaves Washington in mid-July for the political parties' conventions and lawmakers' August recess." \[Wall Street Journal, [6/28/16](http://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-democrats-block-zika-spending-bill-over-exclusion-of-planned-parenthood-1467133283)\]

-   **President Obama Requested \$1.9 Billion To Combat Zika.** According to the Washington Post, "President Obama on Monday asked Congress to set aside \$1.9 billion to respond to the Zika virus abroad and to prepare for it in the United States, saying the funds are necessary to halt the spread of the disease and 'protect the health and safety of Americans.' The White House had detailed the outlines of the request earlier this month, arguing that new resources are needed to help ramp up surveillance efforts, control the mosquitoes spreading Zika, accelerate research into new vaccines and diagnostic tests, and help countries already battling the virus." \[Washington Post, [2/22/16](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/obama-asks-congress-for-19-billion-to-combat-spread-of-zika-virus/2016/02/22/c5b270c4-d9af-11e5-891a-4ed04f4213e8_story.html)\]
