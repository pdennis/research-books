### Safe Motherhood Grants

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Reauthorize Safe Motherhood Grants Through FY 2028.** In March 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would reauthorize safe motherhood grants to states for fiscal years 2024 through 2028 to support efforts to sustain the health of the mother through pregnancy and postpartum, eliminate disparities in maternal health outcomes, and identify solutions to improve health outcomes for mothers. It would expand the role of the Maternal Mortality Review Committees to include the collection and quality of death records. It also would require the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to establish and disseminate, at least once per fiscal year, best practices on preventing maternal deaths. The bill would authorize \$108 million annually in fiscal years 2024 through 2028 for the safe motherhood grants." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 382 to 12. \[House Vote 61, [3/5/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll061.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/5/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/61?38); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3838](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3838/all-actions)\]
