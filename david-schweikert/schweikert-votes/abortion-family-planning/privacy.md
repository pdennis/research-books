### Guaranteeing Women's Medical Privacy In A Bill Banning Federal Funds To Pay For Abortions

**2015: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Guaranteeing Women's Medical Privacy In A Bill Banning Federal Funds To Pay For Abortions.** In January 2015, Schweikert effectively voted against guaranteeing women's medical privacy in a bill banning federal funds to pay for abortions. According to Congressional Quarterly, the motion to recommit would have "clarif\[ied\[ that nothing in the bill could be construed to authorize any party from violating the medical privacy of women, including the victims of rape or incest, with respect to their choice or use of health insurance." The underlying measure would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "permanently prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortion or abortion coverage, prohibits federal medical facilities and health professionals from providing abortion services, and prohibits individuals and small businesses from receiving federal subsidies and tax credits under the 2010 health care overhaul to purchase health care plans that cover abortions. The measure provides an exception for abortions in cases of rape or incest and for saving the life of the mother. It also requires all qualified health plans that provide abortion coverage to prominently disclose that fact to enrollees at the time of enrollment, as well as to prominently display such information in any marketing or advertising materials, plan comparison tools or summaries of benefits and coverage." The vote was on the motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 177 to 240. \[House Vote 44, [1/22/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll044.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/22/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/44?2); Congressional Quarterly, [1/24/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4607612/2?10&search=sv8trLUx)\]
