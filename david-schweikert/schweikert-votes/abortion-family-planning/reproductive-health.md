# Reproductive Health Products

### Reaffirming FDA Approval Authority

**2022: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Reaffirming The Preemption Of The FDA's Authority Regarding Reproductive Health Product Approvals Over State Or Local Regulations That Restrict Reproductive Health Products.** In December 2022, according to the Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the "automatic agreement to \[...\] a resolution (H Res 1434) that would reaffirm that the Food and Drug Administration's authorities to approve or authorize reproductive health products have a preemptive effect with respect to any state or local laws that inhibit access to or use of any reproductive health product." The vote was on the adoption of the rule and automatic agreement to the resolution. The House adopted the rule and adopted the resolution by a vote of 216 -- 193. \[House Vote 531, [12/21/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll531.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/21/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/531?15); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 1529](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/1529/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 1434](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/1434/all-actions)\]
