# Gag-Rule

### School-Based Health Centers

**2015: Schweikert Effectively Voted To Bar Funding For School Districts If Their Health-Centers Provide, Counsel Or Refer For Abortion Care.** In February 2015, Schweikert voted for a House rule on an education reform bill with self-executing language on the 'Gag Rule' for school based health centers. According to NARAL, the resolution would have "provide\[ed\] for House consideration of the legislation" for the Student Success Act. Also according to NARAL, "The self-executing rule added language denying funding for school districts unless their school-based health centers agree not to provide, counsel, or refer for abortion care." The vote was on the resolution. The House adopted the resolution by a vote of 234 to 184. The House later passed the underlying legislation, but the final version which became law, which was different legislation, did not include the policy. \[House Vote 93, [2/26/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll093.xml); NARAL, [12/30/15](http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/download-files/2015-congressional-record.pdf); Congress.gov, [H.R. 5](https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr5/BILLS-114hr5pcs.pdf); Congress.gov, [H.
