# Youth Residential Programs

### Child Abuse

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Study Child Abuse In Federally-Funded Youth Residential Programs.** In December 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would require the Department of Health and Human Services, within 45 days of the bill's enactment, to contract with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to study the nature, prevalence, severity and scope of child abuse, neglect, and deaths in youth residential programs. It would require the study to identify all forms of federal and state funding and existing standards of care for such programs, and include recommendations to improve the oversight of youth residential programs that receive federal funding. It must also include the development and implementation of education and training resources for those who interact with children in residence to establish best practices and eliminate the use of physical, mechanical, or chemical restraint and seclusion and instead promote the use of positive behavioral interventions. The study must also include recommendations for innovative programs designed to provide community support and resources for at-risk youth. It would require that under the contract, the National Academies would, within three years of the bill's enactment and every two years thereafter for 10 years, issue a report informed by the study and make such report available to state agencies and the public." The House passed the bill by a vote of 373 to 33. \[House Vote 512, [12/18/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll512.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/18/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/512?4); Congressional Actions, [S. 1351](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1351/all-actions)\]
