# Community Disaster Resilience Zones

### Disaster Risk Index And Resilience Zones

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Codifying The National Risk Index Tool, Against Requiring The Federal Government To Designate Community Disaster Resilience Zones, And Against Allowing For The Increase Of The Federal Share Of Public Infrastructure Pre-Disaster Migration Assistance To 90%.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the Community Disaster Resilience Zones Act of 2022, which would "codify the National Risk Index tool, requiring the federal government to develop and maintain publicly accessible products that identify natural hazard risks, including relevant ratings and data for loss exposure, social vulnerability and community resilience. It would require the tool to be reviewed and updated within 180 days of enactment and at least once every five years thereafter. It would also require the federal government to designate the 50 census tracts assigned the highest hazard risk after each periodic update as 'community disaster resilience zones.' Within these areas, it would allow the federal government to increase the federal share of public infrastructure pre-disaster migration assistance to 90 percent and provide financial or technical assistance to entities that plan to perform resilience or migration projects." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 333-92, thus the bill was sent to President Biden and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 507, [12/6/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll507.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/6/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/507?0); Congressional Actions, [S. 3875](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3875/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Established Community Disaster Resilience Zones That Would Qualify For Additional Federal Aid For Resilience Or Mitigation Projects.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "S 3875, that would establish community disaster resilience zones that would be eligible for increased federal assistance for resilience or mitigation projects." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/30/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/committees-20220330483164?3)\]
