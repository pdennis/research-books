# Federal Wildland Firefighters

### Minimum Pay And Mental Health Leave

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Requiring Federal Wildland Firefighters To Be Paid A Minimum Of \$20 Per Hour And Against Providing Them Seven Consecutive Days Of Special Mental Health Leave.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the Continental Divide Trail Completion Act, which would "establish a minimum pay rate of approximately \$20 per hour for federal wildland firefighters and provide them up to seven consecutive days of special mental health leave." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 218-199, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 414, [7/29/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll414.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/414?5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5118](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5118/actions)\]

-   **The Provision Would Raise The Minimum Pay For Federal Wildland Firefighters From The Biden Administration's \$15 Per Hour Minimum Wage To \$20 Per Hour, Or \$43,000 A Year.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Included in the legislation is language from a bill (HR 5631) Neguse introduced to peg the minimum wage for federal wildland firefighters to the level on the general schedule currently earning roughly \$20 an hour, or \$43,000 a year. The bill would raise the floor above the \$15 per hour minimum wage announced by the Biden administration last year, and allow further hazard-duty pay." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7538764?1)\]
