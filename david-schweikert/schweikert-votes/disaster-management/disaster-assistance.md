'The bill is simply nothing that any Republican should support. It appropriates too much money; more money than last month's previously-passed versions of the legislation which 150 Republicans voted against,' FreedomWorks wrote." \[The Hill, [6/3/19](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/446762-58-gop-lawmakers-vote-against-disaster-aid-bill)\]
