# California Wildfire

### 2018 Funding

**2018: Schweikert Voted Against A February 2018 Two-Year Budget Deal Which, Among Other Things, Increased Spending By \$300 Billion, Suspended The Debt Ceiling And Provided Nearly \$90 Billion In Disaster Relief For The 2017 Hurricanes And Wildfires.** In February 2018, Schweikert voted against a two-year budget deal that re-opened the government after a brief shutdown. According to the New York Times, "With Mr. Trump's signature, the government will reopen before many Americans were aware it had closed, with a deal that includes about \$300 billion in additional funds over two years for military and nonmilitary programs, almost \$90 billion in disaster relief in response to last year's hurricanes and wildfires, and a higher statutory debt ceiling." In addition, according to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation "would provide funding for federal government operations and services at current levels through March 23, 2018 \[...\] \[and\] retroactively extends numerous tax breaks that expired at the end of 2016. It also extends the CHIP program for another four years (through FY 2027) and funds community health centers for another two years." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the bill. The House agreed to the motion, essentially on passage, by a vote of 240 to 186. The bill was then sent to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 69, [2/9/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll069.xml); New York Times, [2/8/18](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/us/politics/congress-budget-deal-vote.html); Congressional Quarterly, [2/9/18](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2018/H/69?21); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1892](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1892/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Provided \$51.5 Billion In FEMA Funding, \$23.5 To The Disaster Relief Fund And \$28 Billion To Community Development Block Grants.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Of the total \$89.3 billion provided, \$51.5 billion goes to two major federal response and recovery program accounts: the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (\$23.5 billion), which is the government's primary source for immediate disaster relief, for continued response and recovery activities; and the Housing and Urban Development Department's Community Development Block Grant Program (\$28 billion) to help communities rebuild homes and infrastructure and prepare for future disasters." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/8/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5262332?20)\]

### Supplemental

**2017: Schweikert Voted Against \$81 Billion In Supplemental Aid For The 2017 Hurricanes And The California Wildfires.** In December 2017, Schweikert voted against supplemental funding for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria and wildfires from 2017. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Passage of the bill that would make further supplemental appropriations for fiscal 2018 for disaster assistance for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria and wildfires that occurred in calendar year 2017. The bill would authorizes \$81 billion in aid for ongoing response and recovery from 2017 hurricanes and wildfires, and would authorize Puerto Rico to use surplus toll credits to cover the local share of federal highway emergency relief. The bill would remove a cap on federal highway assistance to U.S. territories for fiscal 2018 and 2019." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 251 to 169. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 709, [12/21/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll709.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/21/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/709?0); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4667](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4667/all-actions)\]
