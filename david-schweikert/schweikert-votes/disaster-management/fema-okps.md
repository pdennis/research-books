### Funding

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2020 Minibus Appropriations Bill, Which Provided \$22.5 Billion For FEMA, Rejecting The Administration's To Eliminate Many FEMA Programs.** In December 2019, Schweikert voted against the FY 2020 minibus appropriations bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure provides \$22.5 billion for FEMA (including \$240 million in offsetting collections) --- \$5.4 billion (32%) more than FY 2019 and \$4.0 billion more than requested. It rejects the administration's proposal to substantially cut or eliminated many FEMA grant programs." The vote was a motion to concur in the Senate Amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 280-138. The Senate then passed the bill and the President signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 690, [12/17/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll690.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/17/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/690?11); Congressional Actions, [H.R.1158](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1158/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22:%5b%22hr+1158%22%5d%7d&s=1&r=1&KWICView=false)\]
