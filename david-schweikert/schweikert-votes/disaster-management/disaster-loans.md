# Disaster Assistance Loans

### Rural Disaster Declarations

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Authorize The Small Business Administration To Declare A Disaster In Rural Areas For The Purpose Of Providing Disaster Assistance Loans.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Disaster Assistance for Rural Communities Act, which would "allow the Small Business Administration to declare a disaster, for the purpose of providing disaster assistance loans, in rural areas in which the president has declared a major disaster but has not authorized direct financial assistance, if the SBA determines, upon request by a state or tribe, that 'significant damage' has occurred. It would define 'significant damage' as losses of at least 40 percent of either the fair replacement value or pre-disaster fair market value of the damaged property, whichever is less. The bill would also require the SBA to report annually to Congress on economic injuries resulting from major disasters in rural areas and the agency\'s response to requests for assistance under the bill\'s provisions. It would also require the Government Accountability Office to report to Congress on unique challenges in providing rural disaster assistance and legislative recommendations to improve such assistance." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 406-8, thus the bill was sent to President Biden and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 517, [12/8/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll517.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/8/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/517?25); Congressional Actions, [S. 1617](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1617/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Allowed Rural Areas To Receive Federal Aid If Federal Disaster Assistance Had Not Been Previously Authorized For Such Area, If The Governor Or Native Chief Executive Requested The Disaster Declaration, And If Any Home, Entity Or Small Agricultural Cooperative Had Incurred Uninsured Property Losses Of At Least 40%.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "S 1617, that would authorize the Small Business Administration to declare a disaster in a rural area for which the president has declared a major disaster, for the purposes of providing disaster assistance. As amended by a Risch, R-Idaho, substitute amendment, entities in rural areas could receive federal aid if: federal disaster assistance has not been previously authorized for individuals in the area; the relevant governor or Native American chief executive requests such a declaration; and any home, small business, nonprofit or small agricultural cooperative in the area has incurred uninsured property losses of at least 40 percent of the estimated fair replacement value or pre-disaster fair market value of the damaged property." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/15/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/committees-20220215480380?28)\]
