### Funding

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Fund The U.S. Fire Administration And To Reauthorize Two Federal Emergency Management Agency Programs For Fire Response.** In May 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that \[...\] would authorize \$95 million annually for the U.S. Fire Administration through fiscal 2028, an increase of 24 percent over current funding levels, including \$3.4 million per year to develop standards for evaluating new firefighting technologies, such as personal protection equipment, virtual reality training methods and equipment, and hazard warning devices. It also would reauthorize two Federal Emergency Management Agency programs through fiscal 2028, each at \$750 million annually, to support fire departments, including to hire new firefighters, as well as emergency medical service organizations and state fire training academies. It would also require Government Accountability Office audits and reports on USFA and federal firefighting funding, and it would prohibit any Chinese entity from receiving funds authorized by the bill." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 393 to 13. \[House Vote 194, [5/8/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll194.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/8/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/194/?45); Congressional Actions, [S. 870](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/870/all-actions)\]
