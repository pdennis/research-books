# Pandemic Emergency Response

### Funding

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Reauthorize Pandemic Medical Disaster Programs.** In January 2013, Schweikert voted for legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "reauthorize\[d\] several pandemic medical disaster and emergency response programs, including the BioShield Special Reserve Fund at \$2.8 billion from fiscal 2014-2018. It would \[have\] authorize\[d\] \$534 million for national stockpile activities related to pandemic and all-hazard preparation and \$642 million annually through fiscal 2017 for grants to state and local governments for local response infrastructure and coordination between federal and local jurisdictions." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 395 to 29. A related version of the bill became law. \[House Vote 24, [1/22/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll024.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/22/13](http://cq.com/vote/2013/H/24?1); Congressional Quarterly, [3/7/13](http://cq.com/vote/2013/H/56?2); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 307](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/307/all-actions)\]
