# Wildfire And Drought

### Prevention, Response And Mitigation

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Supporting A Prevention, Response And Mitigation Package To Address Wildfires And Droughts.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the Continental Divide Trail Completion Act, which would "include a range of provisions to support prevention, response and mitigation related to wildfires, drought and other natural disasters." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 218-199, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 414, [7/29/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll414.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/414?5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5118](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5118/actions)\]
