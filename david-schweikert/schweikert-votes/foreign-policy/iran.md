According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "prohibit\[ed\], in most instances, the U.S. government from directly or indirectly providing U.S. or foreign promissory notes, currency or precious metals, to the governments of Iran, North Korea, and any government that would qualify as a state sponsor of terrorism. The measure would \[have\] require\[d\] sanctions be imposed on any Iranian person who kidnaps a U.S. citizen or resident, and would also \[have\] prohibit\[ed\] payments to any country for the release of unjustly detained U.S. nationals." The vote was on passage. The House passed the legislation by a vote of 254 to 163, but the Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 554, [9/22/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll554.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/22/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/554?14); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5931](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5931/all-actions)\]

-   **January 2016: U.S. Government Sent \$400 Million In Cash To Iran, Which Was For Past Debts; Payments Coincided With A Release Of Several American Prisoners, Which Some Called Ransom.** According to the Washington Post, "Lately, the GOP has focused on a \$400 million cash payment the United States sent to Iran on the same day in January that the deal was implemented and several American prisoners, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, were released. The money was to settle Iran's claim before an international tribunal that the United States owed it \$400 million, plus interest, in funds set aside to pay for military weapons that were never delivered following the Iranian Revolution of 1979. Earlier this month, administration officials said in a closed-door congressional briefing that they had also paid \$1.3 billion of interest in two additional cash tranches sent to Iran on Jan. 22 and Feb. 5, according to aides present." \[Washington Post, [9/23/16](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/09/23/house-passes-bill-rebuking-ransom-payments-to-iran/)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Prohibit The Administration From Allowing Iran To Use The Dollar, Which Would Jeopardize The Iranian Nuclear Deal.** In July 2016, Schweikert voted for a bill that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "codif\[ied\] existing U.S. rules forbidding Iran access to the U.S. dollar in even lightning-fast financial transactions. The bill, which passed by a vote of 246-181 would also clarify that U.S. dollars held by foreign financial institutions cannot be used in off-shore transactions on behalf of Iranian banks and businesses." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 246 to 181, but the Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 478, [7/14/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll478.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/14/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4929578?36); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4992](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4992/all-actions)\]

-   **The Administration In Part Would Veto The Bill Because It Would Undermine The Iran Nuclear Deal.** According to a Statement of Administration Policy, "These bills would undermine the ability of the United States to meet our JCPOA commitments by reimposing certain secondary economic and financial sanctions lifted on 'Implementation Day' of the JCPOA -- the day on which the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verified Iran's completion of key nuclear-related steps. \[...\] The President has made it clear that he will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of the JCPOA. If the President were presented with H.R. 4992, H.R. 5119, or H.R. 5631, he would veto these bills." \[Statement of Administration Policy, [7/11/16](http://www.cq.com/pdf/4927149.pdf)\]

-   **The Department Of Treasury Warns That The Bill Could Weaken The U.S. Dollar And Its Status As The World Currency Reserve.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Treasury Department has warned of consequences of restricting how foreign banks can use their U.S. dollar reserves, saying it risks a weakening of the U.S. dollar as the world's preferred currency reserve." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/14/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4929578?36)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Impose Additional Sanctions On Iran Due To Its Ballistic Missile Program, In Contravention Of The Iran Nuclear Deal.** In July 2016, Schweikert voted for a new round of sanctions against Iran, focused on its ballistic-missile program, international terrorism and human rights abuses. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "expand\[ed\] and strengthen\[ed\] existing U.S. sanctions against Iran related to its ballistic-missile program, support for international terrorism, and ongoing human rights abuses against its population. The measure would \[have\] mandate\[d\] sanctions against the Iran Revolutionary Guard, Iran's Aerospace Industries Organization, and would \[have\] expand\[ed\] the list of persons subject to sanctions for human rights abuses. The measure would \[have\] also require\[d\] the Treasury Department to create and maintain a watch list for entities connected to the Revolutionary Guard. The measure would \[have\] add\[ed\] ballistic missile and ballistic-missile launch technology to the list of sanctionable activities. The measure would \[have\] also authorize\[d\] the Secretary of State to provide assistance to individuals and entities working to promote democracy in Iran." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 246 to 179, but the Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 467, [7/14/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll467.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/14/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/467?38); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5631](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5631/all-actions)\]

-   **Administration Threatened To Veto The Bill In Part Because It Lacked National Security Waivers And Would Have Violated The Terms Of The Iran Nuclear Agreement.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "However, the White House in its veto threat of the bill said the sanctions requirements violate U.S. commitments under the nuclear deal. The administration also faulted the bill for not giving it any national security waiver authorities, which is traditional in sanctions legislation." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/14/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4929578?36)\]

-   **National Iranian American Council: Sanctions Would Reach "Absurd" Levels; Could Lead To Significant Block Of Academic Exchange Between Iran And The U.S.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Tyler Cullis, a legal fellow with the National Iranian American Council, which supports lifting the broader U.S. trade embargo on Iran, said the McCarthy bill would take U.S. sanctions against Tehran to 'absurd' levels. 'If there is a research institute at an Iranian university engaged in certain activities with application to Iran's ballistic missile program, the president would be obligated to include Iran's research sector on the initial list and all persons involved in Iran's research sector, including those employed by or in attendance at Iranian universities and research institutes, would be subject to U.S. blocking sanctions and barred from entering the United States,' he said. 'There could no longer be any hoped-for academic exchange between the United States and Iran.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/14/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4929578?36)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Bar The U.S. From Purchasing Heavy Water From Iran.** In July 2016, Schweikert voted for legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] federal funds from being used to purchase or issue licenses to purchase heavy water, a component of nuclear reactors, from Iran." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 249 to 176, but the Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 441, [7/13/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll441.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/13/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/441?40); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5119](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5119/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Was In Response To The U.S. Purchasing 32 Tons Of Heavy Water From Iran.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill is a response to an April announcement by the Energy Department that it would buy 32 tons of heavy water from Iran for \$8.6 million. Heavy water is an ingredient used to make nuclear warheads. Under the terms of the nuclear deal, Tehran agreed to reduce its stockpile of the material." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/14/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4929578?36)\]

-   **The Administration Said That The Purchase Was To Keep Iran From Having Access To So Much Heavy Water, In Accordance With The Iranian Nuclear Agreement; The President Has Threatened To Veto.** According to a Statement of Administration Policy, "Removal of excess heavy water from Iran denies Iran access to material that could be stockpiled for potential nuclear weapons production while also providing the international market access to an important commodity for research and non-nuclear industries. As part of the JCPOA, Iran committed to a limit on the amount of heavy water that it could accumulate, but may sell its excess heavy water, further ensuring that Iran does not use this product to develop material for a nuclear weapon. \[...\] The President has made it clear that he will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of the JCPOA. If the President were presented with H.R. 4992, H.R. 5119, or H.R. 5631, he would veto these bills." \[Statement of Administration Policy, [7/11/16](http://www.cq.com/pdf/4927149.pdf)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Prevent The U.S. From Buying Any Heavy Water From Iran.** In May 2016, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have prevented any funding in an FY 2017 Energy and Water appropriations bill from being used to purchase Iranian heavy water. According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have "prohibit\[ed\] use of funds made available by the bill to buy heavy water from Iran." The underlying legislation was an FY 2017 Energy and Water appropriations bill. The vote was on the amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 251 to 168. The House later rejected the underlying bill. \[House Vote 263, [5/25/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll263.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/25/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/263?66); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **The U.S. Purchased The Heavy Water As A Result Of The Iran Nuclear Deal.** According to Reuters, "The United States will buy heavy water from Iran's nuclear program and expects it to be delivered within weeks, U.S. officials said on Friday, a move that Republican lawmakers quickly criticized. The U.S. Department of Energy, or DOE, will buy 32 metric tonnes of heavy water from Iran worth \$8.6 million, a department spokeswoman said. Heavy water is a component of making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy, that is not radioactive. Under last year's landmark nuclear deal between Iran, the United States and five other world powers, Tehran is responsible for reducing its stock of heavy water, which it can sell, dilute or dispose of, under conditions. \[...\] 'Our purchase of the heavy water means that it will instead be used for critically important research and non-nuclear industrial requirements,' Kirby added." \[Reuters, [4/22/16](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa-idUSKCN0XJ25G)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Restrict President Obama's Ability To Lift Sanctions On Iran's Financial Institutions As Called For By The Nuclear Agreement Until The Institutions Stop Conducting Transactions With The Revolutionary Guard Or Other Terrorist Organizations.** In February 2016, Schweikert voted for a bill that would restrict the president's ability to lift sanctions called for by the Iran Nuclear agreement. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "restrict\[ed\] the president's ability to lift sanctions on Iranian and other financial institutions, as called for by the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, by requiring various certifications to Congress. Specifically, it would \[have\] prohibit\[ed\] the president from removing the foreign financial institutions from the Treasury Department\'s Office of Foreign Asset Control's list of blocked nationals and persons until the president submits to Congress a certification that the institutions have not knowingly facilitated a significant transaction for Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, a foreign terrorist organization or anyone sanctioned in connection with Iran's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic-missile programs." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 246 to 181. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 54, [2/2/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll054.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/2/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/54?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3662](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3662/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Requires The President To Certify That Financial Institutions, Persons Or Individuals Have Not Knowingly Conducted A Significant Transaction With A Foreign Terrorist Organization.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill prohibits the president from lifting sanctions against such financial institutions until he certifies to Congress that the bank or financial institution has not conducted a significant transaction for, or on behalf of, Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, a foreign terrorist organization or anyone sanctioned in connection with Iran's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic-missile programs. Similarly, sanctions could not be lifted against persons or entities until the president certifies that they have not knowingly conducted a significant transaction for, or provided material support to, a foreign terrorist organization or anyone sanctioned in connection with Iran's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic-missile programs. This requirement would apply with respect to Iran's proliferation of 'weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery (including missiles capable of delivering such weapons), including any efforts to manufacture, acquire, possess, develop, transport, transfer, or use such item.' In addition, the president could not remove the designation of Iran as a primary money-laundering concern until he certifies that Iran is no longer supporting terrorism, or pursuing weapons of mass destruction or illicit financial activities. (In November 2011, the United States designated the entire Iranian banking sector, including the country's central bank, as a 'primary money-laundering concern.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/29/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4825331/11?11&search=IO32N5zP)\]

-   **The House Had Earlier Held A Vote On The Legislation, But It Was Voided Due To Attendance Issues.** According to Reuters, "The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly approved legislation on Tuesday that would restrict President Barack Obama\'s ability to lift sanctions under the international nuclear deal with Iran, nearly three weeks after a similar vote was canceled. \[...\] The legislation is not expected to become law, even though Republicans control both the House and Senate. Even if it were passed by the Senate, Obama has promised a veto, saying the measure would kill the landmark nuclear agreement. The House narrowly passed the legislation last month, but the vote was voided after nearly a third of the chamber showed up too late to cast their votes." \[Reuters, [2/2/16](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa-congress-idUSKCN0VB2PO)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Prohibit President Obama From Waiving Iran Sanctions Until Iran Pays All Of The Terrorism-Related Judgements It Owes.** In October 2015, Schweikert voted for a bill that would have prevented the president from waiving sanctions on Iran until he certified that Iran paid all of its terrorism related judgements. According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill would have "prohibit\[ed\] the president from waiving sanctions under the Iran Nuclear Agreement until Iran pays the legal terrorism-related judgment it owes. The president would be required to certify to Congress that the Iranian government has paid all outstanding judgments before Iran's sanctions are lifted or its assets released." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 251 to 173. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 533, [10/1/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll533.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/1/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/533?24); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3457](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3457/all-actions)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Compensating The American Victims Of The Iran Hostage Situation As Part Of The FY 2016 Omnibus.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted against creating a fund to compensative the American victims of the Iran hostage situation. According to Congressional Quarterly, the measure would have "create\[d\] a fund to compensate American victims of terrorism who either hold a final judgment issued against a state sponsor of terrorism under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act or were taken hostage from the U.S. embassy in Iran in 1979. Iranian hostage crisis victims, who are precluded from going to court, would be treated as though each hostage has a judgment for \$10,000 per day in captivity (or for spouses and children of hostages, a lump sum of \$600,000). The measure appropriates \$1 billion for the fund, which in the future would receive criminal and civil penalties levied against state sponsors of terrorism and their co-conspirators." The legislation was, according to Congressional Quarterly, a FY 2016 Omnibus Appropriations bill. The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill with an amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 316 to 113. The legislation was later combined with a tax extender bill.

Investigators are trying to determine if any crimes were committed, according to the person briefed on the case and another person familiar with the matter. But it is not yet clear if the Department of Justice will bring any charges against Malley or what the scope of any charges might be. The people were granted anonymity to discuss a highly sensitive issue. Malley, who declined to comment, has denied any wrongdoing. The insights from the letter and from the people with whom POLITICO spoke --- including that a criminal inquiry is underway --- add new details to prior reports that Malley's handling of classified information was at issue. \[...\] Malley's security clearance was suspended roughly a year ago, and he later went on full-time leave." \[CNN, [5/10/24](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/10/fbi-probes-iran-envoy-malley-classified-info-00157321)\]
