### Human Rights Concerns

**2021: Schweikert Voted To Impose Sanctions Against Entities And Cambodian Government, Military And Security Officials That Have Committed Human Rights Violations.** In September 2021, Schweikert voted for the Cambodia Democracy Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require the president to create a list of Cambodian government, military and security officials who have committed human rights violations associated with undermining democracy in Cambodia, as well entities owned by such officials, and to impose visa and economic sanctions on such individuals and entities." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 403-17. \[House Vote 301, [9/28/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll301.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/28/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/301?13); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4686](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4686/actions)\]
