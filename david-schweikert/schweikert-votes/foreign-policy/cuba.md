### Travel To Cuba

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Restricting Flights And Sea Travel To Cuba.** In June 2015, Schweikert voted for an amendment to the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 that would stop funding for programs that restricted travel to Cuba. According to the Congressional Quarterly, the "amendment that would bar use of funds made available by the bill to administer, implement or enforce two sections of the bill. One section would bar use of funds to facilitate new flights originating from the United States that land, or pass through, property confiscated by the Cuban government. The other section would bar use of funds by the Federal Maritime Commission to issue a license or certificate for a commercial vessel that docked or anchored within the previous 180 days within seven miles of a port on property that was confiscated by the Cuban government." The underlying bill was, according to Congressional Quarterly, "A bill making appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2016, and for other purposes." The vote was on passage and the House rejected amendment 176 to 247. \[House Vote 306, [6/4/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll306.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/4/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/306?8); Congressional Quarterly, [Congressional Record](http://www.cq.com/bill/114/HR2577?9), 6/4/15; [Congressional Actions](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2577), [H.

-   **Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA): This Amendment Stops Congress From Implementing A Travel Embargo To Cuba And Is The Right Thing For Diplomacy.** According to a floor speech by Rep. Barbara Lee, "I want to thank Mr. Sanford for his leadership as it relates to this amendment and helping us try to end these outdated and failed policies toward Cuba. \[...\] This amendment would strike two provisions included in this bill that would further limit travel to and from Cuba via flights and ferries. Not only are these provisions inappropriate policy riders, they would deny Americans the right to travel to Cuba. I understand some of my colleagues, including our subcommittee chair, have a personal interest in Cuba, yet personal interest should not stall progress nor interfere with what is good for the American people. I am joined by many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and a diverse coalition of organizations and businesses in strong opposition to this and other attempts to undermine efforts to normalize relations with Cuba. Not only are the current provisions in this bill wrong for diplomacy, they are patently antibusiness. That is why this amendment is supported by the United States Chamber of Commerce, Orbitz, the American Society of Travel Agents, and the broad-based coalition Engage Cuba. These provisions that are currently in the bill set us back 50 years. They would eliminate flights that airlines have already invested in and would kill a new market for maritime carriers. \[...\] The President\'s announcement to expand travel was a step in the right direction." \[Congressional Record, [6/4/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/house-section/article/H3882-5)\]

-   **Rep. Diaz-Balart (R-FL): Bill Actually Prevented Cuba From Profiting From The Use Of Stolen Or Confiscated American Property.** According to a floor speech by Rep. Diaz-Balart (R-FL), "Let me also talk about what the language in the bill does that this amendment is trying to take out. It doesn't deal with the overriding issue of policy versus whether we like the President\'s policy or not. It deals with one specific issue and one specific issue only, Mr. Chairman: whether we should condone, whether we should approve, whether we should permit the trafficking of confiscated\--in other words, stolen\--property. When the gentleman from my side of the aisle said that, you know, this is an issue about traveling to other countries, when we travel to Russia, we should be able to do that, that is fine. But is he also saying, which is what this amendment says, that we should condone the use of stolen, confiscated property, property that was stolen and confiscated illegally from Americans? So if you support this amendment, Mr. Chairman, what you are saying is it is okay to do business on property that was stolen from Americans. " \[Congressional Record, [6/4/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/house-section/article/H3882-5)\]
