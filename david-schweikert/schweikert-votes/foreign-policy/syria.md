### Refugees

**2015: Schweikert Voted For The American SAFE Act Which Would Effectively Prohibit Admitting Syrian Refugees.** In November 2015, Schweikert voted for to effectively prohibit admitting Syrian refugees into the United States. According to USA Today, the legislation would have "halt\[ed\] the admission of Syrian refugees into the U.S. until they undergo a more stringent vetting process --- the strictest ever required for people fleeing a war-torn nation. \[...\] \[Opponents of the bill\] argued that the bill\'s new requirements would effectively shut down the U.S. refugee resettlement program for Syrians." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 289 to 135. The Senate rejected a cloture motion on a motion to proceed in January 2016. President Obama has threatened to veto the bill. \[House Vote 643, [11/19/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll643.xml); USA Today, [11/19/15](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/19/house-passes-bill-bar-syrian-refugees-us-without-more-vetting/76041668/); Statement of Administration Policy, [11/18/15](http://www.cq.com/pdf/4792971.pdf); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4038](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4038/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Would Require The Secretary Of Homeland Security, The Director Of The FBI And The Director Of The National Intelligence To Certify That A Thorough Background Check Was Conducted And That The Refugee Is Not A Threat Before Admittance.** According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill would have "prohibit\[ed\] admitting any refugee from Iraq or Syria to the United States before the secretary of Homeland Security, with the unanimous concurrence of the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the director of National Intelligence, has conducted a thorough background check on any refugee from Iraq or Syria and certified that they are not a security threat to the United States. Further, the bill would \[have\] require\[d\] that the secretary of Homeland Security submit a monthly report to the appropriate congressional committees on the number of applications for admission and number of security certifications not made. \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/19/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/643?1)\]

-   **New York Times: Legislation Is In Part A Response To The Terrorist Attacks in Paris.** According to a New York Times Editorial, "Conceived partly in response to the Paris attacks, the bill seeks to 'pause' admission of Syrian and Iraqi refugees. Though there are real fears of terrorism, this measure represents election-year pandering to the xenophobia that rears up when threats from abroad arise. People who know these issues --- law enforcement and intelligence professionals, immigration officials and humanitarian groups --- say that this wrongheaded proposal simply would not protect Americans from "foreign enemies." \[New York Times Editorial, [11/18/15](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/opinion/refugees-from-war-arent-the-enemy.html)\]

-   **Since The Beginning Of The Syrian War, Half Of The Population Has Left As Refugees.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war in 2011, more than half of Syria\'s prewar population of 22 million people have fled their homes, half of whom are children. More than 4 million have left the country and become refugees, while approximately 8 million are internally displaced within the country\'s borders. Of those who have left the country, most continue to reside in refugee camps within Turkey and Jordan. Beginning last summer, however, increasing numbers have attempted to reach Europe through Greece, the Balkans and other routes. Of these, most are attempting to reach Germany, which has admitted close to 100,000 migrants from Syria." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/18/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4792987/2?7&search=7hWaK7Oe)\]

-   **President Obama Has Said That The Government Would Admit An Additional 10,000 Refugees.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The United States in FY 2015 admitted 70,000 refugees into the nation, of whom fewer than 2,000 were from Syria. (The three largest groups came from Myanmar, Iraq and Somalia.) Most of the Syrian refugees admitted into the U.S. thus far have been single mothers and their children, religious minorities and victims of violence or torture. Earlier this year, President Barack Obama said the government would increase to 10,000 the number of Syrian refugees whom the U.S. admits. According to the State Department, those additional admittees will come from the 18,000 referrals already submitted by the United Nations; more than half are expected to be children." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/18/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4792987/2?7&search=7hWaK7Oe)\]

-   **Refugee Screening Process Already Includes Screenings By Several Agencies And Is A Lengthy Process.** According to NPR, "1. Refugees are screened by several different agencies. Their first point of a refugee\'s contact is with the U.N. High Commission for Refugees. The UNHCR refers people to countries based on whether they have any family members there and where resettlement makes the most sense, say U.S. officials. If that\'s the U.S., then refugees are vetted by the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI\'s Terrorist Screening Center, and the Departments of State, Defense and Homeland Security. Fingerprints are taken, biographical information is collected. They are then each individually interviewed by U.S. officials trained to verify that they\'re bona fide refugees. Refugees from Syria are then subject to additional screening that looks at where they came from and what caused them to flee their home, stories that are checked out. All of this occurs before a refugee is allowed to set foot in the country. 2. It's a lengthy process. As you might imagine, all of the vetting, from interviews to fingerprinting, takes a while. On average, officials say it\'s 18 to 24 months before a refugee is approved for admission to the U.S." \[NPR, [11/18/15](http://www.npr.org/2015/11/17/456395388/paris-attacks-ignite-debate-over-u-s-refugee-policy)\]

-   **Opponents Note That The Legislation Plays Into ISIS's Hands.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents of the bill argue that it unnecessarily denies entry into the United States to those who are fleeing the terror of the Islamic State, and that by grossly exaggerating the risks of the current refugee program it plays into the hands of ISIL by promoting fear and panic in the U.S." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/18/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4792987/2?7&search=7hWaK7Oe)\]

**2015: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against To Only Require The Secretary Of Homeland Security And Not The Federal Bureau Of Investigation And The Director Of National Intelligence To Certify That An Iraqi And Syrian Refugee Is Not A Threat.** In November 2015, Schweikert effectively voted against to only require the Secretary of Homeland Security and not the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of National Intelligence to certify that an Iraqi and Syrian refugee is not a threat. According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have "require\[d\] the secretary of Homeland Security to verify the identities and biographic information of Iraqi and Syrian refugees and certify that the individual is not a threat to the security of the United States, but would not require that the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the director of National Intelligence conduct background checks or concur in this certification." The underlying legislation would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] admitting any refugee from Iraq or Syria to the United States before the secretary of Homeland Security, with the unanimous concurrence of the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the director of National Intelligence, has conducted a thorough background check on any refugee from Iraq or Syria and certified that they are not a security threat to the United States." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 180 to 244. \[House Vote 642, [11/19/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll642.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/19/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/642?10); Congressional Quarterly, [11/19/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/643?1); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4038](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4038/all-actions)\]

-   **The U.S. Troops In Northeast Syria Assist The Syrian Democratic Forces In Countering The Islamic State's Presence.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Roughly 900 U.S. troops, many of them special forces, remain in northeast Syria. Through them, the United States is able to assist the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition of Kurdish, Arab and other ethnic militias and rebel groups, in keeping the Islamic State's lingering presence in the region in check." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/8/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7681947?48)\]

It also would sanction those who knowingly receive property or interest in property that the foreign person knows is associated with the illicit production and distribution of captagon. Sanctions would include prohibiting transactions in property or interests in property; ineligibility for visas, admission or being paroled into the U.S. and the revocation of any current visa. The bill would allow sanctions to be waived if the president submits a written determination and justification to the House Foreign Affairs and Judiciary committees and the Senate Foreign Relations, Judiciary and Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs committees if the waiver is important to the national security interests of the United States. It also would allow waivers for humanitarian assistance." The vote was on passage.

It would prohibit any action by the U.S. government to recognize or imply that the U.S. recognizes Bashar al-Assad or any government in Syria that is led by him. It also would expand who is sanctionable to include adult family members of a foreign person who violated the prohibition in the law, along with any entities owned or controlled by such individuals, with the exception of family members who the president determines have dissociated themselves from such individuals. Under the bill, sanctionable conduct would include knowingly engaging in the following: providing significant commercial financial services (over \$5 million) to the Syrian government, providing significant financial, material or technological support to (or knowingly engaging in a significant transaction with) Syria Arab Airlines, Cham Wings or any foreign entity owned or controlled by either company, or diverting goods or international humanitarian assistance intended for the Syrian people. It also would require the president to make a determination, within 120 days of receiving a request from a certain congressional committee, on whether sanctions should be imposed against a specific person or entity." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 389 to 32. \[House Vote 49, [2/14/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll049.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/14/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/49?9); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3202](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3202/all-actions)\]

It bars the administration from using the amendment to justify sending the armed forces into hostile situations and requires the president to report to Congress under the War Powers Resolution on the use of U.S armed forces abroad. The authority for training and equipping Syrian rebels would \[have\] expire\[d\] Dec. 11, 2014, or earlier if a defense authorization is enacted." The underlying bill was an FY 2015 CR.
