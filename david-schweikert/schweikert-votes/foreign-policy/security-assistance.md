# Security Assistance

### Compliance With Humanitarian Law

**2024: Schweikert Voted Against Requiring Recipients Of U.S. Security Assistance To Comply With International Humanitarian Law.** In June 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "amendment no. 50 that would prohibit the use of funds provided by the bill to administer or enforce the 2024 National Security Memorandum 20, which requires countries receiving security assistance from the U.S. to provide assurances that defense articles will be used in accordance with international humanitarian law." The vote was on the amendment. The underlying legislation was the FY 2025 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 216 to 197. \[House Vote 314, [6/27/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll314.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/27/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/314?11); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt.1055](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/1055/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8771](http://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8771/all-actions)\]
