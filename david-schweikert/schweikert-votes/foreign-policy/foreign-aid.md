### Israel

**2024: Schweikert Voted For The Israel Security Assistance Supplemental Appropriations.** In February 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would provide \$17.6 billion in security assistance to Israel to defend itself in war against Hamas. It would include \$13.9 billion in supplemental appropriations for the Defense Department and an additional \$3.5 billion in State Department foreign military financing for the sale of U.S. military equipment to Israel. Appropriations provided to aid Israel under the bill would be designated as emergency funding and would not count against discretionary allocations, nor require to be offset." The vote was on passage. The House rejected the bill by a vote of 250 to 180. \[House Vote 38, [2/6/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll038.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/6/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/38?10); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7217](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7217/all-actions)\]

-   **The White House Issued A Veto Threat On The Bill Due To A Lack Of Funding For Ukraine.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The White House issued a veto threat on the House bill, which would provide \$17.6 billion for Israel and for U.S. operations in the Middle East, while delivering nothing for Ukraine, border security or the rest of the Senate package. A statement of administration policy dismissed the House measure as a 'political ploy' that would leave many national security demands unmet. 'Instead of working in good faith to address the most pressing national security challenges, this bill is another cynical political maneuver,' the statement said. 'The security of Israel should be sacred, not a political game.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/6/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-7931999?13)\]

-   **The House Freedom Caucus Criticized The Bill For Lacking An Offset.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans, meanwhile, are far from united in support of the bill. The rebellious Freedom Caucus, made up of roughly 30 to 40 members, issued a statement of opposition over the weekend, attacking Johnson, R-La., 'for reversing course on his stance to require new supplemental spending to be offset.' Unlike an earlier House-passed bill for Israel (HR 6126), the new measure drops a proposed funding cut for the IRS. Johnson told reporters last month that it 'makes a lot of sense' for Israel aid to have an offset, especially if it involves cuts to the IRS. 'We can\'t just keep spending money that we don\'t have,' he said. Caroline Coudriet has more on the House bill." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/6/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-7931999?13)\]
