### Reaffirming Support

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Reaffirm Support For Moldova's Sovereignty, Democratic Development, Economic And Energy Independence, And Efforts To Tackle Corruption.** In April 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for a resolution that would "state that the House of Representatives urges the U.S. government, European Union and other transatlantic partners to increase support for Moldova\'s democratic development, economic and energy independence and efforts to root out corruption; affirms Moldova\'s sovereign right to determine its own partnerships free of external coercion and pressure, including to associate with the E.U. and other regional organizations; and supports the Joint Commercial Commission and other activities to strengthen the bilateral trade, investments and relations between the United States and Moldova. Among other provisions, it would state that the House commends Moldova's efforts to take in Ukrainian refugees and urges increased international assistance for such efforts; reaffirms the importance of free and fair elections in Moldova; and calls on the Russian government to fulfill its commitments made at the 1999 summit for Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and withdraw its military forces and munitions from Moldovan territory, including the separatist region of Transnistria." The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 409-17. \[House Vote 132, [4/27/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll132.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/27/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/132?5); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 833](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/833/actions)\]
