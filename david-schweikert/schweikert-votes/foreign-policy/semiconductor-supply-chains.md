# Global Semiconductor Supply Chains

### Interagency Working Group

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Establish An Interagency Working Group To Address Semiconductor Supply Chain Issues Caused By Russian Invasion Of Ukraine And Develop Plans For Future Geopolitical Developments That Could Impact Global Semiconductor Chains.** In April 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Protecting Semiconductor Supply Chain Materials from Authoritarians Act, which would "require the president, within 30 days of enactment, to establish an interagency working group to address semiconductor supply chain issues caused by Russia\'s attack on Ukraine. It would require the State Department, within 60 days of enactment, to submit a report of the working group to Congress that analyzes the impacts of the attack on supply chains and the global economy, particularly the supply of palladium, neon gas, helium and hexafluorobutadiene; describes U.S. diplomatic actions taken to diversify the supply of those resources; lists any other important elements in the semiconductor supply chain that have been affected; and recommends potential legislative action to further bolster the supply. The bill would also require the department to submit annual reports of the working group outlining plans for likely future geopolitical developments that could disrupt global semiconductor supply chains, including an invasion of Taiwan, geopolitical instability in east Asia or Europe, strategic competitors dominating parts of the supply chain, a future international health crisis, and natural disasters or natural resource shortages." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 414-9, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 128, [4/27/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll128.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/27/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/128?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7372](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7372/actions)\]
