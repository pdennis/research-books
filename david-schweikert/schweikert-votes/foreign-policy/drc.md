# Democratic Republic Of The Congo

### Declared National Emergency

**2023: Schweikert Voted To End The Declared National Emergency From October 27, 2006, Which Imposed Sanctions Due To The Conflict In The Democratic Republic Of The Congo.** In July 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for a resolution that would "terminate the national emergency declared by the president on Oct. 27, 2006, with respect to sanctions due to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo." The vote was on passage. The House rejected the resolution by a vote of 27 to 381. \[House Vote 333, [7/18/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll333.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/18/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/333?21); Congressional Actions, [H.J. Res. 68](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-joint-resolution/68/all-actions)\]

-   **Republicans And Democrats Warned That Terminating The Declared Emergencies Would Unfreeze Assets Of Militia Leaders And War Criminals While Also Rejecting Compensation To American Victims Of Terrorism.** According to Reuters, "The House overwhelmingly rejected the resolutions in a series of votes, after mainstream Republicans and Democrats warned that ending the emergencies would unfreeze the assets of militia leaders, arms dealers and accused war criminals, while denying compensation to U.S. victims of terrorism." \[Reuters, [7/18/23](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-rebuffs-bid-by-republican-hardliners-end-some-sanctions-2023-07-18/)\]

-   **The Far-Right Republicans Who Sponsored The Resolutions Argued The Emergency Declarations Were Old And Were Examples Of The "Deep State."** According to Reuters, "The hardliners said the emergency declarations, dating back to the presidencies of Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama, were out-of-date and had become examples of the 'deep state,' former President Donald Trump\'s conspiratorial term for Washington officials who opposed his will." \[Reuters, [7/18/23](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-rebuffs-bid-by-republican-hardliners-end-some-sanctions-2023-07-18/)\]

-   **The Resolutions Sought To Terminate 5 Presidential Emergency Declarations That Have Permitted Sanctions Against U.S. Enemies In The Middle East And Africa, Including Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Libya And The Congo.** According to Reuters, "The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday turned back a bid by hardline conservatives to end five presidential emergency declarations that allow for sanctions against America\'s enemies in the Middle East and Africa. Four Republican Representatives - Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Paul Gosar and Eli Crane - used separate measures known as privileged resolutions to require votes on whether to end longstanding emergency declarations involving Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Libya and Democratic Republic of Congo." \[Reuters, [7/18/23](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-rebuffs-bid-by-republican-hardliners-end-some-sanctions-2023-07-18/)\]
