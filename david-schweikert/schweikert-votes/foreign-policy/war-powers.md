# War Powers Resolution

### Authorization For Use Of Military Force

**2020: Schweikert Voted For Preventing The President From Launching Military Attacks On Iran.** In January 2020, Schweikert voted for Title II of a bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "repeal the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, which authorizes the use of force to defend U.S. national security against 'the continuing threat posed by Iraq and enforce relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 236-166. \[House Vote 34, [1/30/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll034.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/30/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/34?19); Congressional Actions, [H.R.550](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/550/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+550%22%5D%7d&s=2&r=1)\]

-   **Title II Of The Bill Repealed The Authorization For Use Of Military Force (AUMF) That Has Been Used In Several Administrations To Justify Military Actions.** According to The Washington Post, "The House approved two measures Thursday aimed at restraining President Trump from targeting Iran militarily, as lawmakers clamor to force his administration to consult Congress before taking actions that could provoke a war \[...\] The second \[proposal, Title II\], would repeal the authorization for use of military force that Congress passed to facilitate the 2003 Iraq invasion but that administrations have used since then to justify various hostilities --- including Soleimani's killing." \[Washington Post, [1/30/20](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/house-to-vote-on-measures-seeking-to-restrain-trump-on-iran/2020/01/30/e8e963bc-436a-11ea-b5fc-eefa848cde99_story.html)\]

-   **The Trump Administration Offered Various Explanations For The Unauthorized Killing Of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, Which Reminded Democrats Of The 2003 Invasion Of Iraq.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Since Soleimani's killing, the administration including Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper have offered differing explanations for why the Iranian general's killing was warranted and why prior authorization or even consultation with Congress was unnecessary. Those differing explanations remind many Democrats and a few Republicans of the build-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq when the George W. Bush administration falsely insisted that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction that threatened the United States." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/30/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5825067?8)\]

-   **The Trump Administration Argued That Repealing The AUMF Would Undermine "The President's Ability To Defend United States Forces And Interests In The Region Against Ongoing Threats From Iran."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The administration said repealing the 2002 authorization would undermine U.S. troops deployed to Iraq to combat Islamic State extremists even though a separate expansive 2001 anti-terrorism military authorization, passed after the attacks of 9/11, would remain in place. \[Title II\] would undermine 'the president's ability to defend United States forces and interests in the region against ongoing threats from Iran and Iranian-sponsored proxies,' reads the statement of administration policy." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5823829?10)\]

-   **Critics Opposed Repealing The AUMF Without A Replacement.** According to Politico, "Critics of the measures, including the White House, have argued that they would hinder the ability of U.S. forces to defend themselves from attacks --- Another point of contention, particularly with \[Title II\], was that some opponents did not want to repeal the 2002 authorization of force without replacing it with a revised version." \[Politico, [1/30/20](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/30/house-approves-war-powers-legislation-109468)\]

**2019: Schweikert Voted For Repeal The 2002 Authorization Of Military Force.** In July 2019, Schweikert voted for an amendment to the House FY 2020 NDAA that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "repeal the 2002 authorization of military force against Iraq." The vote was on adoption. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 242-180. \[House Vote 464, [7/12/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll464.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/12/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/464?30); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt.555](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/116th-congress/house-amendment/555/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R.2500](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2500/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+2500%22%5D%7d&s=2&r=1)\]

### Iran

**2020: Schweikert Voted To Direct President Trump To Terminate Military Hostilities Against Iran Unless Congress Were To Authorize The Use Of Armed Forces.** In March 2020, Schweikert voted for a joint resolution that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "direct the president to terminate the use of U.S. armed forces for hostilities against Iran or any part of its government or military unless Congress has declared war or provided specific statutory authorization for the use of armed forces. It would clarify that nothing in the joint resolution may be construed to prevent the president from using military force to defend the U.S. against imminent attack. The joint resolution\'s findings would include that the president has a constitutional responsibility to defend U.S. citizens and possessions; that 100 members of the U.S. armed forces sustained traumatic brain injuries in an Iranian attack on the Ain al-Assad Air Base in Iraq; and that members of the U.S. armed forces and intelligence community, including the president, should be passed the bill by a vote of 227-186. The resolution was vetoed by President Trump and the Senate failed to override the veto. \[House Vote 101, [3/11/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll101.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/11/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/101?6); Congressional Actions, [S.J.

It would also state that no previous authorization for use of military force or other existing law may be construed to authorize the use of military force against Iran." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 228-175. \[House Vote 33, [1/30/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll033.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/30/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/33?18); Congressional Actions, [H.R.550](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/550/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+550%22%5D%7d&s=2&r=1)\]

-   **Title I Of The Bill Would Deny Funding For Military Action Against Iran Without Congressional Approval.** According to The Washington Post, "The House approved two measures Thursday aimed at restraining President Trump from targeting Iran militarily, as lawmakers clamor to force his administration to consult Congress before taking actions that could provoke a war \[...\] The first proposal, \[Title I\], would prevent Trump from tapping federal funds for military action against Iran without Congress's approval, except in cases of self-defense or to prevent an imminent strike." \[Washington Post, [1/30/20](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/house-to-vote-on-measures-seeking-to-restrain-trump-on-iran/2020/01/30/e8e963bc-436a-11ea-b5fc-eefa848cde99_story.html)\]

-   **Politico: Critics Argued That Title II Will Hurt The U.S.'s Ability To Defend Itself From Attacks, Though The Measure "Explicitly States That It Is Not Meant To Hinder The Military From Defending Itself."** According to Politico, "Critics of the measures, including the White House, have argued that they would hinder the ability of U.S. forces to defend themselves from attacks --- though \[Title 1\] explicitly states that it is not meant to hinder the military from defending itself and its allies." \[Politico, [1/30/20](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/30/house-approves-war-powers-legislation-109468)\]

**2020: Schweikert Voted Against Curbing President Tr's War Powers In Iran.** In January 2020, Schweikert voted against a concurrent resolution that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "direct the president to terminate the use of U.S. armed forces to engage in hostilities in or against Iran or any part of its government or military unless Congress has declared war or provided specific statutory authorization for the use of armed forces or unless the such use is necessary and appropriate to defend against an imminent armed attack upon the U.S., its territories or possessions, or its armed forces, consistent with the requirements of the War Powers Resolution. It would clarify that nothing contained in the concurrent resolution may be construed to prevent the president from using military force against Al Qaeda or associated forces." The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 231-180. \[House Vote 7, [1//9/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll007.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/9/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/7?3); Congressional Actions, [H.Con.Res.83](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/83/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22h+con+res+83%22%5D%7d&s=1&r=1)\]
