**2018: Schweikert Voted To Sanction Burmese Senior Officials Who Commit Human Rights Abuses.** In May 2018, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] the United States from providing security assistance to the Burmese military until the secretary of State affirms that Burma has demonstrated progress in abiding by international human rights standards and would \[have\] impose\[d\] sanctions against current and former senior officials of the Burmese military who perpetrated humans \[sic\] rights offenses." The underlying legislation was an FY 2019 defense authorization. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 382 to 30. The House later passed the underlying bill. A conference report later became law, but this provision was not included. \[House Vote 227, [5/23/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll227.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/23/18](http://cq.com/vote/2018/H/227?0); Congressional Actions, [H.
