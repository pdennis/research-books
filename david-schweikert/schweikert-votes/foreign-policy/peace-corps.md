# Peace Corps

### Authorizing The Peace Corps Commemorative Foundation

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Authorize The Peace Corps Commemorative Foundation To Build A Commemorative Work Honoring The Peace Corps On Federal Land In The Washington, D.C. Area.** In January 2014, Schweikert voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "authorize\[d\] the Peace Corps Commemorative Foundation to establish a commemorative work on federal land in Washington, D.C., or the surrounding area, to honor the formation of the Peace Corps and its mission and ideals. It \[\] bar\[red\] the use of federal funds for the project." The House passed the bill by a vote of 387 to 7. As the bill had already passed the Senate, it was then sent to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 13, [1/13/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll013.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/13/14](http://www.cq.com/doc/floorvote-242771000); Congressional Actions, [S. 230](http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/230/all-actions/)\]

### Reauthorization

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Authorize \$430.5 Million Annually For FY 2023-2024 For The Peace Corps, Ensure Volunteers Have Access To Menstrual Products, Expand The Readjustment Monthly Allowance, And Provide Short-Term Health Insurance.** In September 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Peace Corps Reauthorization Act of 2022, which would "authorize \$430.5 million annually for fiscal years 2023 and 2024 for the Peace Corps and make various modifications to Peace Corps volunteer benefits and operations. The bill would require the Peace Corps to consult with outside experts, specifically regarding the mental health care provided to volunteers during their service and to establish a policy to ensure that volunteers have access to menstrual products, either by increasing their stipends or directly providing the products. For returning volunteers, it would expand the readjustment allowance from \$125 to \$375 per month served and provide for two months of short-term health insurance. It would codify an executive order granting former volunteers noncompetitive eligibility for federal civil service positions and expand the term of eligibility from one year to two years. Among other provisions, it would require the Peace Corps to waive certain application requirements and prioritize medical clearance for returning volunteers whose service ended involuntarily, including due to suspension of operations, and to establish a policy to prevent retaliation by supervisors against volunteers. It would allow the corps to recruit volunteers to provide online services virtually from outside a host country and, at the request of other agencies, to recruit volunteers to serve within the U.S. for short terms." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 290-125. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 440, [9/19/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll440.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/19/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/440?17); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1456](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1456/all-actions)\]
