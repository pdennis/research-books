Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he supports the 'spirit and intent' of the bill. But he raised concerns that it could empower executive branch officials to crack down on protected speech because the word 'Islamophobia' isn't defined in the legislation. 'It's so vague and subjective that it could be used against legitimate speech for partisan purposes,' McCaul said on the House floor." \[Politico, [12/14/21](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/14/house-islam-omar-perry-boebert-524536)\]
