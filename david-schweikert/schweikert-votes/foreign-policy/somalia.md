### Removal Of U.S. Armed Forces

**2023: Schweikert Voted To Remove All U.S. Armed Forces From Somalia, Except Armed Forces Assigned To Protect The U.S. Embassy.** In April 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for a resolution that would "direct the president to remove all U.S. armed forces from Somalia, other than those assigned to protect the U.S. embassy, within one year of agreement to the concurrent resolution." The vote was on passage. The House rejected the bill by a vote of 102 to 321. \[House Vote 201, [4/27/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll201.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/27/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/201?3); Congressional Actions, [H.Con.Res. 30](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/30/all-actions)\]

-   **The Resolution Would Have Required The Biden Administration To Remove U.S. Troops That Were Deployed For Counterterrorism Efforts In Somalia.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House rejected on Thursday a resolution that would require the White House to remove hundreds of U.S. troops deployed in Somalia as part of counterterrorism efforts." \[Congressional Quarterly, [4/27/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7726364?6)\]

-   **In 2022, The Biden Administration Deployed Less Than 500 U.S. Special Forces In Somalia To Counter The El-Shabab Terrorist Group, Which Was A Reversal Of A Trump Administration Decision To Remove About 750 Troops From Somalia.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Fewer than 500 U.S. special operation forces are estimated to be in Somalia as part of a permanent troop presence to counter the al-Shabab terrorist group. They were deployed nearly a year ago by the Biden administration in a reversal of the decision by former President Donald Trump to remove the approximately 750 troops previously deployed to the Horn of Africa country." \[Congressional Quarterly, [4/27/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7726364?6)\]
