# Committee On Foreign Investment In The US

### Agriculture Investments

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Include The Agriculture Secretary In The Committee On Foreign Investment In The US And To Require Review Of Agricultural Transactions Covered Under The Defense Production Act And Include The Acquisition Of Land By A Person From North Korea, China, Iran, Or Russia.** In September 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would include the Agriculture secretary as a member of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States for transactions that include agricultural land, agriculture biotechnology or the agriculture industry. It also would require CFIUS, upon notification of a reportable agricultural land transaction, to review whether the transaction is covered under the Defense Production Act and, if the committee determines it is a covered transaction, to decide whether the committee should perform a review or take other action. It would define 'reportable agricultural land transaction' as a transaction the Agriculture secretary has reason to believe is a transaction covered by the Defense Production Act; that involves the acquisition of agricultural land by a foreign individual of North Korea, China, Russia, or Iran; and with respect to which a report to the secretary is required under the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978. It would sunset the bill's requirements for a country if it were removed from the list of foreign adversaries." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 269 to 149. \[House Vote 415, [9/11/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll415.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/11/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/415?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 9456](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9456/all-actions)\]
