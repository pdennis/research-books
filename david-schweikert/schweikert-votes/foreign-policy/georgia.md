### U.S. Assistance Against Russian Aggression

**2022: Schweikert Voted For The Georgia Support Act, Which Required The Review Of Assistance To Improve Georgia's Ability To Defend Their Sovereignty From Russian Aggression, Develop Strategies To Combat Russian Disinformation, And Imposed Visa And Property-Blocking Sanctions To Individuals Complicit In Violating Human Rights In Russian-Occupied Georgian Regions.** In April 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Georgia Support Act, which would "require the State Department to take a number of actions to review and bolster U.S. assistance to Georgia. Specifically, it would require the State Department to review existing U.S. security assistance and assess the assistance needed to improve Georgia\'s capacity to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity from further Russian aggression or territorial encroachment; develop a strategy to enhance Georgia\'s capacity to combat Russian disinformation and propaganda; and submit reports to congress assessing U.S. democracy and governance assistance to Georgia and cybersecurity cooperation with Georgia. The bill would also require the president to impose visa and property-blocking sanctions against foreign persons responsible for or complicit in committing human rights abuses in the Russian-occupied Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and against entities that have materially assisted or are controlled by such persons." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 406-20, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 131, [4/27/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll131.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/27/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/131?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 923](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/923/actions)\]
