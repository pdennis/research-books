### Condemning

**2020: Schweikert Voted For Condemning Religious Intolerance Abroad, Urging Governments To Release Individuals Imprisoned For Their Religious Beliefs And Expressing Support For The United Nations To Tackle Religious Intolerance.** In December 2020, Schweikert voted for a resolution that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "state that the House calls on the president and State Department to prioritize the repeal of blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws in bilateral relationships with countries that have such laws. It would urge the governments of such countries to release individuals who have been imprisoned or persecuted on such charges and ensure their safety once released. It would express support for United Nations efforts to combat religious intolerance." The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 386-3. \[House Vote 236, [12/7/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll236.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/7/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/236?10); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 512](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/512/actions)\]
