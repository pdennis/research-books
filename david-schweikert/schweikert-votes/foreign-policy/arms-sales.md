### Congressional Notification

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Would Require Congressional Notification Before Certain Weapons May Be Exported To Foreign Countries.** In September 2021, Schweikert voted against an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit the export of certain weapons to foreign countries unless the Commerce Department notifies the chair and ranking members of the congressional foreign issues committees before granting the export license." The vote was on adoption of an amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 215-213. \[House Vote 292, [9/23/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll292.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/23/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/292?9); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 127](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/117th-congress/house-amendment/127/actions?r=1&s=a); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4350](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350/actions)\]
