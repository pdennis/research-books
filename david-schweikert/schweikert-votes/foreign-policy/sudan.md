### Condemning Military Coup

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Stand With The People Of Sudan In Their Democratic Aspirations, Sanction Military Coup Leaders And Encourage International Partners To Suspend Sudan's Participation In Global Organizations Until Sudan Were Retuned To Constitutional Rule.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for a concurrent resolution, which would "state that the House of Representatives condemns the Oct. 25, 2021, military coup in Sudan, stands with the people of Sudan in their democratic aspirations and recognizes the prime minister and his cabinet as the constitutional leaders of Sudan?s transitional government. It would state that the House calls for Sudan\'s military junta to immediately release all individuals detained in connection with the coup; return to constitutional rule under the transitional constitution as the starting point for negotiations with civilians toward full civilian rule; ensure security forces respect the right to peaceful protest; and transfer leadership of the Sovereign Council to a civilian member of the council. It would also call on the secretary of State to identify coup leaders for consideration for targeted sanctions; monitor efforts by external parties to support the coup and military junta; and call on international partners to join U.S. efforts to suspend Sudan\'s participation in all regional multilateral organizations until Sudan is returned to constitutional rule under the transitional constitution." The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote 417-7, thus the resolution was sent to the Senate. The Senate did not take substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 352, [7/14/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll352.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/14/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/352?23); Congressional Actions, [H.Con.Res. 59](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/59/all-actions)\]
