### Establishing Policy And Special Coordinator Position

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Establish A Special Coordinator Position For Uyghur Issues, Who Would Promote The Protection Of Uyghur Culture And Identity And Work With Uyghur Leaders And Foreign Countries To Protect Uyghur Human Rights And Religious Freedom.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Uyghur Policy Act of 2021, which would "establish a special coordinator position for Uyghur issues within the State Department to promote the protection and preservation of Uyghur culture and identity. It would require the coordinator to, among other tasks, maintain close contact with Uyghur leaders and establish contacts in foreign countries to pursue a policy of protecting Uyghur human rights and religious freedom." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 407-17. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 494, [12/1/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll494.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/1/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/494?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4785](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4785/all-actions)\]
