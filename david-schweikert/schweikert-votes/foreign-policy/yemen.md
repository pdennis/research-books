Res. 74](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-joint-resolution/74/all-actions)\]

-   **Republicans And Democrats Warned That Terminating The Declared Emergencies Would Unfreeze Assets Of Militia Leaders And War Criminals While Also Rejecting Compensation To American Victims Of Terrorism.** According to Reuters, "The House overwhelmingly rejected the resolutions in a series of votes, after mainstream Republicans and Democrats warned that ending the emergencies would unfreeze the assets of militia leaders, arms dealers and accused war criminals, while denying compensation to U.S. victims of terrorism." \[Reuters, [7/18/23](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-rebuffs-bid-by-republican-hardliners-end-some-sanctions-2023-07-18/)\]

-   **The Far-Right Republicans Who Sponsored The Resolutions Argued The Emergency Declarations Were Old And Were Examples Of The "Deep State."** According to Reuters, "The hardliners said the emergency declarations, dating back to the presidencies of Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama, were out-of-date and had become examples of the 'deep state,' former President Donald Trump\'s conspiratorial term for Washington officials who opposed his will." \[Reuters, [7/18/23](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-rebuffs-bid-by-republican-hardliners-end-some-sanctions-2023-07-18/)\]

Four Republican Representatives - Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Paul Gosar and Eli Crane - used separate measures known as privileged resolutions to require votes on whether to end longstanding emergency declarations involving Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Libya and Democratic Republic of Congo." \[Reuters, [7/18/23](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-rebuffs-bid-by-republican-hardliners-end-some-sanctions-2023-07-18/)\]

### Saudi-Lead War

**2019: Schweikert Voted For A Resolution That Would Require The Removal Of Most U.S. Troops In Or Impacting Yemen.** In April 2019, Schweikert voted for a resolution that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "direct\[ed\] the president, within 30 days of enactment, to remove U.S. armed forces from hostilities in or affecting the Republic of Yemen, including in-flight refueling of non-U.S. aircraft, unless a declaration of war or specific authorization for such use of forces has been enacted. The bill specifies that its provisions would not apply to U.S. forces engaged in operations directed at al-Qaeda or associated forces. The measure would also require two reports regarding risks to U.S. and Saudi citizens as well as the risk of humanitarian crisis, and an assessment of the potential increased risk of terrorist attacks." The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 247 to 175. The legislation was later vetoed by President Trump, which the Senate later failed to overturn. \[House Vote 153, [4/4/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll153.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/13/19](http://cq.com/vote/2019/H/83?2); Congressional Actions, [S. J. Res. 7](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/7/all-actions)\]

-   **The Resolution Would Have Ended All Military Operations In Yemen Unrelated To Counterterrorism Actions Against Al-Qaida.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The resolution would have directed the Defense Department to cease all operations in Yemen unrelated to counterterrorism actions against al-Qaida, including the aerial refueling of Saudi coalition jets. The Pentagon voluntarily suspended its refueling of planes last fall, but the resolution would have made it permanent." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/2/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5525853?4)\]

-   **Congress Considered Several Bills That Sought To Signal To Saudi Arabia Over Their Actions In Yemen And Other Human Rights Violations.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Lawmakers have other bills in both chambers that seek to send a signal to Saudi Arabia over its conduct in Yemen and other human rights abuses through provisions that would impose sanctions on Saudi Arabian officials who are preventing humanitarian aid from reaching Yemenis and prohibiting offensive weapon sales to the kingdom." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/2/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5525853?4)\]
