### Strengthen

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Strengthen The Cooperation Between The U.S., Australia, India, And Japan Known As The Quadrilateral Dialogue.** In February 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would express the sense of Congress that the U.S. should strengthen the joint cooperation between the U.S., Australia, India and Japan, known as the Quadrilateral Dialogue or Quad. It would direct the State Department to submit to Congress, within 180 days of the bill\'s enactment, a strategy to increase engagement and cooperation with the Quad, and, within 60 days of its enactment, to enter into negotiations with Japan, Australia and India to establish a Quad Intra-Parliamentary Working Group to facilitate closer cooperation. It also would establish a U.S. group, which would have a maximum of 24 members of Congress, to represent the U.S. in the working group. It also would establish guidelines for annual meetings and group leadership. Under the bill, the group would be required to submit an annual report to the congressional foreign affairs committees on its expenditures." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 379 to 39. \[House Vote 54, [2/15/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll054.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/15/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/54?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5375](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5375/all-actions)\]
