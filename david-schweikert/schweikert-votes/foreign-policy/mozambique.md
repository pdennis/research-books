It would state that the House urges the Mozambican government to work with international partners to counter violent extremism in the province; take steps to protect children from abduction, forced conscription and other forms of exploitation; ensure humanitarian workers have access to vulnerable populations in the province; and develop national strategies to address underlying social, political and economic grievances of local populations. It would also state that the House calls on the U.S. government, donor governments and the international donor community to coordinate diplomatic, defense and development resources for the Mozambican government and to support continued humanitarian assistance."
