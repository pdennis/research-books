### Global Health Security Agenda And Pandemic Preparedness

**2021: Schweikert Voted To Direct The President To Advance The Global Health Security Agenda, Which Would Address Global Threats Posed By Infectious Diseases, And Direct The State Department To Establish An International Fund For Global Health Security And Pandemic Preparedness.** In June 2021, Schweikert voted for the National Science Foundation for the Future Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "state U.S. policy and require the president to develop and implement a strategy with regard to advancing the Global Health Security Agenda, which is an international partnership to address global health threats posed by infectious diseases. It would require the president to establish a global health security strategy coordinator and an interagency review council to coordinate relevant interagency activities and advance the goals of the agenda. It also would direct the State Department, in coordination with other federal agencies, to seek to enter into negotiations with donors, relevant UN agencies and other multilateral stakeholders to establish an international fund to support global health security and pandemic preparedness, and it would authorize U.S. contributions to the fund." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 307-112. \[House Vote 188, [6/28/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll188.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/28/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/188?47); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 391](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/391/actions)\]
