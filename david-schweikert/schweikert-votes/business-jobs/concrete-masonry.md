### Government Promotion

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Allow Concrete Masonry Producers Create A Coordinated Program With One Another, Overseen By The Commerce Department, To In Part Develop Markets For The Products.** In November 2016, Schweikert voted for legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "allow\[ed\] concrete masonry producers to establish a coordinated program of research, education and promotion to improve, maintain and develop markets for concrete masonry products, with the Commerce Department to oversee the board that would administer the program." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 355 to 38. The Senate took no substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 575, [11/14/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll575.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/11/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4986647/6?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 985](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/985/all-actions)\]
