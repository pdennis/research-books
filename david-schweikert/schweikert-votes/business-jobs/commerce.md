# Department Of Commerce

### Appropriations

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Cut Almost Every Commerce Department, Justice Department And Science Program Account By One Percent.** In May 2014, Schweikert voted for an amendment to the FY 2015 Commerce Department, Justice Department and science programs appropriations bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would reduce all accounts in the bill by 1 percent, except those for the FBI, fees and expenses of witnesses, public safety officer benefits and the U.S. Trustee System Fund." The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 148 to 253. \[House Vote 255, [5/30/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll255.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/30/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/255); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 724](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/742/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4660](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4660/all-actions)\]

### Census Bureau

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2020 Minibus Appropriations Bill, Which Provided \$7.6 Billion For The Census Bureau Including \$3.5 Billion For The 2020 Census.** In December 2019, Schweikert voted against the FY 2020 minibus appropriations bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure provides \$7.6 billion for the Census Bureau --- almost double FY 2019 funding and 28% more than requested. The total includes \$7.3 billion for periodic censuses and programs, including \$6.7 billion for the 2020 Decennial Census. Of that amount, \$3.5 billion is to be transferred to the Commerce Department inspector general for oversight of the 2020 Census. The bill directs the Census Bureau to use the funds provided to support new initiatives aimed at increasing response in historically undercounted and hard to count communities through the use of mobile assistance centers." The vote was a motion to concur in the Senate Amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 280-138. The Senate then passed the bill and the President signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 690, [12/17/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll690.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/17/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/690?11); Congressional Actions, [H.R.1158](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1158/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22:%5b%22hr+1158%22%5d%7d&s=1&r=1&KWICView=false)\]
