# Coronavirus Stimulus Package

**2020: Schweikert Voted Against A \$2.2 Trillion Coronavirus Aid Package.** In October 2020, Schweikert voted against a coronavirus relief package that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide roughly \$2.2 trillion in funding to further address the health and economic effects of COVID-19, including approximately \$436 billion for direct aid to state and local governments; \$120 billion for assistance to restaurants; \$75 billion for a national testing program; \$28.3 billion for an extended airline industry payroll support program; and funding for state and federal response related to health care, education, housing, and food supply. It would reinstate federal funding of expanded unemployment compensation benefits through January 2021, provide an additional round of tax rebates of \$1,200 for individuals with incomes of \$75,000 or less, and extend the Paycheck Protection Program. The bill would provide \$257 billion for states, territories, and tribal governments and \$179 billion for local governments to address costs and economic impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill. The House passed the bill by a vote of 214-207. \[House Vote 214, [10/1/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll214.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/1/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/214?12); Congressional Actions, [H.R.925](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/925/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+925%22%5D%7d&s=4&r=1)\]

-   **House Democrats Passed The Bill Largely As A "Symbolic Expression" Of Their Frustration With Stalled Talks On Another Coronavirus Aid Package.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "House Democrats passed their own revised version of a coronavirus aid package Thursday, in a largely symbolic expression of frustration with protracted talks on a bipartisan compromise. On a party-line vote of 2014-207, the House sent to the Senate a \$2.2 trillion package that Republicans have lambasted as a costly 'liberal wish list.' No House GOP lawmaker voted for it." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/1/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6021891?1)\]

-   **The Trump Administration Package Offered \$1.5 Trillion, And The Senate Republicans' Proposal Provided Only \$640 Billion.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Trump administration has offered about \$1.5 trillion \[...\] Senate Republicans want to spend even less: They chafed even at a \$1 trillion package over the summer before backing a bill with just \$650 billion in relief --- more than half of it offset." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/1/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6021891?1)\]

-   **The House Democrat Relief Package Included Another Round Of \$1,200 Tax Rebates, Expanded Unemployment Benefits, And Funding For Schools, Health Care, And State And Local Governments.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Democratic bill provide another round of \$1,200-per-adult tax rebates, expanded unemployment benefits, and more money for schools, health care and state and local governments, among other things \[...\] Democrats also pumped some additional money into new priorities since their May legislation. Chief among them is a \$120 billion fund for the pandemic-battered restaurant industry, along with \$28 billion for the airline industry." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/1/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6021891?1)\]

-   **Senate Republicans Are Opposed To Spending Significant Funds On Another Aid Package.** According to the Wall Street Journal, "In reaching a deal, House Democrats and the Trump administration also face another obstacle: Senate Republicans opposed to again doling out money for a major aid package. Many Republicans in the Senate see the economy recovering without additional aid injections and are wary of further deficit spending. After a \$1 trillion plan from GOP leaders didn't draw broad support in their party, last month, Senate Republicans put together a 'skinny' proposal to try to unify their ranks. That bill, which called for \$300 billion in new funds and repurposing \$350 billion in other funds, failed in the Senate when Democrats blocked it." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/1/20](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-aid-talks-still-stuck-after-counteroffer-by-mnuchin-11601570240)\]
