# Rural Cooperative Development Grants Program

### Elimination

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Eliminate Rural Cooperative Development Grants As Part Of The FY 2016 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted for eliminating the Rural Cooperative Development Grants. According to the Republican Study Committee, "The RCDG program should be eliminated in FY 2016, saving \$22 million per year." The underlying budget resolution would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] for \$2.804 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2016, not including off-budget accounts. The substitute would call for reducing spending by \$7.1 trillion over 10 years compared to the Congressional Budget Office baseline." The vote was on the substitute amendment to a Budget Resolution. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 132 to 294. \[House Vote 138, [3/25/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll138.xml); Republican Study Committee, [FY 2016 Budget](http://rsc.flores.house.gov/files/Initiatives/rsc-budget.pdf); Congressional Quarterly, [3/25/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/138?23); Congress.gov, [H.

-   **Rural Cooperative Development Grants Are Designed To Improve The Economic Situation Of Rural Business Startup, Expansions Or Improvement.** According to the USDA, "The primary objective of the RCDG program is to improve the economic condition of rural areas by assisting individuals and businesses in the startup, expansion or operational improvement of rural cooperatives and other mutually-owned businesses through Cooperative Development Centers. Grants are awarded through a national competition. Each fiscal year, applications are requested through a notice published in the Federal Register and through an announcement posted on grants.gov." \[USDA, [Accessed 3/10/16](http://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/rural-cooperative-development-grant-program)\]
