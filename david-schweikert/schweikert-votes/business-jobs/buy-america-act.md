**2016: Schweikert Voted For A Water Infrastructure Authorization Bill That Included A Requirement That The Steel And Iron Used For Its Drinking Water Projects Be Made In America For Only One Year.** In December 2016, Schweikert voted for a water infrastructure authorization bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "authorize\[d\] approximately \$10 billion for construction of 30 Army Corps of Engineers water projects, including navigation, flood control and environmental restoration projects. It would \[have\] authorize\[d\] feasibility studies for 30 possible water projects, and would \[have\] deauthorize\[d\] nine existing projects. It also would \[have\] create\[d\] an expedited process for deauthorization of other projects that are no longer viable for construction. It would \[have\] authorize\[d\] \$170 million in response to the lead-contaminated water system in Flint, Mich., including \$100 million in capitalization grants to the EPA's Drinking Water State Revolving Fund that the city could use to replace the its water pipes. It also would \[have\] create\[d\] new programs related to safe drinking water. The measure would \[have\] require\[d\] additional water be pumped south from Northern California." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 360 to 61. The Senate later passed the legislation, thus the bill was sent to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 622, [12/8/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll622.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/10/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/S/163?0); Congressional Actions, [S. 612](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/612/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Included Requirement That Iron And Steel Be Made In The USA For Drinking Water Projects Only Be Applicable For One Year.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Finally, the measure includes Buy America language that requires that iron and steel products purchased in FY 2017 using DWSRF funds must be made in the United States. This requirement could be waived if there is not the quantity and quality necessary to fill the need, if doing so is not in the public interest or if the purchase would increase the project\'s overall cost by 25%." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/7/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5000971?5)\]

-   **Some Democrats Had Pushed For A Permanent Buy America Requirement.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Other Democrats objected to a provision to require drinking water projects authorized in the bill use U.S.-made iron and steel for fiscal 2017, saying the 'Buy America' provision should have been extended indefinitely. A similar provision applying to clean water projects was made indefinite in the 2014 water resources bill." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/10/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-5003243?10)\]

### Requiring Government Agencies To Use Items Made In America

**2017: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2018 Congressional Progressive Caucus's Budget Resolution, Which Among Other Things, Increased Taxes On The Rich And Corporations And Called For Closing Loopholes To Require Government Agencies To Use Items Made In America.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted against an FY 2018 CPC budget resolution. According to Congressional Quarterly, the resolution would "provide for \$3.8 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018, not including off-budget accounts. It would raise overall spending by \$3.5 trillion over 10 years and would increase revenues by \$8.2 trillion over the same period through policies that would increase taxes for corporations and high-income individuals. It would repeal the Budget Control Act sequester and caps on discretionary spending, would modify the tax code by adding five higher marginal tax rates, would create a public insurance option to be sold within the current health insurance exchanges and would call for implementation of comprehensive immigration overhaul." In addition, according to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, "Closes loopholes so our government agencies use materials made in America." The amendment was a substitute amendment for the GOP's FY 2018 budget resolution in part designed to start the process for tax reform. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 108 to 314. \[House Vote 553, [10/4/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll553.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/4/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/553?1); Congressional Progressive Caucus, [Accessed 10/12/17](https://cpc-grijalva.house.gov/the-peoples-budget-a-roadmap-for-the-resistance-fy-2018); Congressional Actions, [H.
