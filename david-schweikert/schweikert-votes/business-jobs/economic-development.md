### Appalachian Regional Commission

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating The Appalachian Regional Commission.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted for a budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555, [10/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll555.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/5/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/555?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating Regional Commissions, Including The Appalachian Regional Commission.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Eliminate Regional Commissions The RSC budget recommends cutting regional commissions including the Denali Commission, Appalachian Regional Commission, the Northern Border Regional Commission, the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, and the Delta Regional Authority. These economic development programs are duplicative of other programs and spend federal funding for local projects. Not only is the federal government out of money, but also it is ill-equipped to adequately prioritize local infrastructure and development projects. These activities are also more appropriately carried out by state and local governments. Beginning in FY 2018 the commissions should be eliminated, saving the taxpayers \$198 million per year. The president's Budget Blueprint proposes to eliminate these duplicative agencies." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed 10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Defund The Economic Development Administration (EDA), Saving \$247.5 Million.** In May 2014, Schweikert voted for an amendment that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would strike language in the \[underlying Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations\] bill that would provide \$247.5 million for the Economic Development Administration and transfer the savings to the bill's spending reduction account." The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 129 to 280. \[House Vote 243, [5/29/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll243.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/29/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/243); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Amendment Sponsor Argued EDA Was "Nothing More Than The Purest Of Wealth Distribution Programs," Funding Projects Across The Country With Taxpayer Money For Politicians To Take Credit For, And Attempting To Pick Winners And Losers From Washington, DC.** According to the Congressional Record, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-KS), the amendment's sponsor, said, "Part of the Department of Commerce, the Economic Development Administration, was established in 1965 as an element of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. The current administration and, to be frank, many administrations, have used this for their own pork barrel projects and their own cookie jar. The EDA has spent over \$3.2 billion in grants and does nothing more than pick amongst winners and losers by region, industry, and community. At its very core, the EDA is nothing more than the purest of wealth distribution programs. My amendment would eliminate funding for the EDA, totaling \$247 million in fiscal year 2015, and send this money to the deficit reduction account. Based on current levels, eliminating EDA will save over \$2.5 billion over the next decade. \[...\] First, let me describe what the EDA does. It takes dollars from all across the country. That money comes to Washington where the EDA takes 20 percent of it off the top. That is the cost of the administrative burden of running the Economic Development Administration. They then ask companies and communities to apply for 'free money' from the Federal Government to renovate a movie theater or to build a new industrial park. While many much \[sic\] these projects aren't necessarily bad, some are just plain ridiculous. These are local projects that either have enough support from their local communities so they could certainly advance without Federal funding or they require Federal money because the local community won\'t support them. Either way, the Federal Government has no role in being involved." \[Congressional Record, [5/29/14](https://beta.congress.gov/crec/2014/05/28/CREC-2014-05-28-pt1-PgH4868.pdf#page=18)\]

-   **EDA Funding Included \$5 Million For The Agency To Use To Aid Projects Aimed At Bringing Jobs Back To The United States From Overseas.** According to the Congressional Record, House Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Frank Wolf (R-VA) said, "This bill before the House today also includes for the EDA \$5 million to support projects to facilitate relocation to the United States of jobs currently being done overseas. If you have an iPhone, it is made in China. GE has moved plants off of the United States to China. This is in order to fund. It will enable EDA to help work with American businesses to bring back, to repatriate, their manufacturing activities back to the United States." \[Congressional Record, [5/29/14](https://beta.congress.gov/crec/2014/05/28/CREC-2014-05-28-pt1-PgH4868.pdf#page=19)\]

-   **House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY): EDA's "Targeted Investments" Have Resulted In The Creation Of Hundreds Of Thousands Of Jobs In Hard-Hit Communities Such As His Rural District.** According to the Congressional Record, Rodgers said, "My congressional district, Madam Chairman, encompasses rural parts of southern and eastern Kentucky. The region has historically lagged behind others in the Commonwealth and in the country. Particularly in recent years, as we have reeled from a crushing downturn in the coal industry that has cost my district some 8,000 good-paying mining jobs in just the last few months, we have had to think and act strategically to revitalize our economic engine. Creating jobs in a mountainous region without sufficient roadways or suitable water infrastructure might seem an unsurmountable challenge. But I have always encouraged my constituents and community leaders to 'plan their work, and work their plan.' With the help of EDA, this is what we have been doing. The Economic Development Administration is one of the few entities in our Federal Government uniquely qualified to address the needs of communities with chronically high unemployment issues or facing enormous setbacks due to natural disasters. EDA's grants, awarded in a competitive fashion, leverage over \$10 from the private sector for every Federal dollar invested and are targeted at facilities that are essential for private industry to remain or locate in these underachieving areas. As a result of these targeted investments in water systems, workforce training centers, intermodal facilities, or broadband networks, struggling communities across the country have seen the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs in just the last decade. I wholeheartedly concur with the sponsor of the amendment that the role of the Federal Government is not to create jobs, but instead to create the conditions favorable for private sector job creation. By partnering with local area development districts, leveraging public and private dollars, and engaging the local workforce, EDA does just that." \[Congressional Record, [5/29/14](https://beta.congress.gov/crec/2014/05/28/CREC-2014-05-28-pt1-PgH4868.pdf#page=19)\]

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Eliminate The Economic Development Administration.** In April 2014, Schweikert voted for the Republican Study Committee's proposed budget resolution for fiscal years 2015 to 2024. According to the Republican Study Committee's budget, "Eliminate the Economic Development Administration (EDA). The EDA is a duplicative program and seeks to accomplish many of the same goals as the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. The EDA should be eliminated beginning in FY2015, saving the taxpayers \$24.7 million per year. This proposal is based on H.R. 887, the EDA Elimination Act." The House considered the RSC budget as a substitute amendment to House Republicans' FY 2015 budget resolution; the amendment was rejected by a vote of 133 to 291. \[House Vote 175, [4/10/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll175.xml); Republican Study Committee, [4/7/14](http://rsc.woodall.house.gov/uploadedfiles/the_budget.pdf); Congressional Actions, [H.

### Southeast Crescent Regional Commission

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating The Southeast Crescent Regional Commission.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted for a budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555, [10/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll555.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/5/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/555?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating Regional Commissions, Including The Southeast Crescent Regional Commission.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Eliminate Regional Commissions The RSC budget recommends cutting regional commissions including the Denali Commission, Appalachian Regional Commission, the Northern Border Regional Commission, the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, and the Delta Regional Authority. These economic development programs are duplicative of other programs and spend federal funding for local projects. Not only is the federal government out of money, but also it is ill-equipped to adequately prioritize local infrastructure and development projects. These activities are also more appropriately carried out by state and local governments. Beginning in FY 2018 the commissions should be eliminated, saving the taxpayers \$198 million per year. The president's Budget Blueprint proposes to eliminate these duplicative agencies." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed 10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]
