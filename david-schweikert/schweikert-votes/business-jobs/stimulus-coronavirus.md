### Child Care

**2020: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2021 Omnibus Appropriations And Coronavirus Relief, Which Extended Child Tax Credits.** In December 2020, Schweikert voted against the second portion of the FY2021 Omnibus Appropriations and Coronavirus Relief package which would include, according to Congressional Quarterly, "a number of tax provision extenders, including for earned income and child tax credits and employer tax credits for employee retention and provision of paid leave." The vote was on concurring in Senate amendment with portion of the amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 359-53 and sent to the President and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 251, [12/21/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll251.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/21/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/251?0); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 133](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/133/actions)\]

**2020: Schweikert Voted Against Expanding Child Care Tax Credits In Order To Help Parents Go Back To Work During The Coronavirus Pandemic.** In July 2020, Schweikert voted against a bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "make emergency fiscal 2020 supplemental appropriations in response to the COVID-19 public health emergency for grants to support family care services and infrastructure and expand certain tax credits for individuals and employers related to child and dependent care. The bill would provide \$850 million for Health and Human Services Department social services block grants for states to provide family care for essential workers, including to pay family care providers, set up temporary government-operated care services or reimburse workers for the costs of care. It would also provide \$10 billion in emergency appropriations for HHS child care infrastructure grants to states to construct or improve child care facilities, prioritizing facilities that primarily serve low-income populations, children under five years of age and children of essential workers, as well as facilities that closed during the COVID-19 pandemic and cannot reopen without making required safety modifications." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 250-161. The Senate took no substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 172, [7/29/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll172.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/172?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R.7327](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7327/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+7327%22%5D%7d&s=1&r=1)\]

-   **Accoridng To The Congressional Budget Office, The Tax Credits Would Cost \$179 Billion.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "House Democrats muscled through \$229 billion in tax breaks and appropriations aimed at shoring up and reopening child care services shuttered by COVID-19 that American families will rely on as they head back to work \[...\] The second bill (HR 7327), which passed 250-161, would cost \$179 billion, according to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. The costliest provision at \$91 billion would expand and make fully refundable the child and dependent care tax credit. The credit currently covers up to 35 percent of the first \$3,000 of expenses per child or other dependent, capped at a total of \$6,000 in expenses \[...\] The House-passed bill would increase the maximum child care and dependent credit to 50 percent, while doubling the amount of eligible expenses." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5970201?3)\]

-   **The Bill Made The Child And Dependent Care Tax Credit Fully Refundable, This Making It Available To Low-Income Families.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The child and dependent care tax credit would also become fully refundable, which 'will make the credit available to low-income families for the first time' said Rep. Linda T. Sanchez, D-Calif. She added that increasing the income threshold brings 'meaningful' assistance to middle-income families." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5970201?3)\]

-   **Republicans Opposed A Tax Credit That Helped Pay For Household Employees Who Can't Provide Services During COVID-19.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans also took issue with a tax credit Democrats would offer to cover pay for household employees who can\'t currently provide services in the home due to COVID-19. House Ways and Means Chairman Richard E. Neal, D-Mass., said the credits would help families retain domestic workers in the interim until lockdowns are lifted, but the GOP argued the provision was a handout to rich families." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5970201?3)\]

**2020: Schweikert Voted Against Providing \$50 Billion For Child Care Stabilization Block Grants In Order To Help Parents Go Back To Work During The Coronavirus Pandemic.** In July 2020, Schweikert voted against the Child Care Is Essential Act that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "establish and provide \$50 billion in emergency appropriations for Health and Human Services Department child care stabilization block grants to states. It would require HHS to award such funds to states within 30 days of the bill\'s enactment. Under the bill\'s provisions, state agencies that administer existing child care block grants would make subgrants to child care providers affected by the COVID-19 public health emergency to cover payroll and other operating costs, including to reimburse costs prior to the award and to account for increased costs due to the emergency, such as implementation of practices related to social distancing, limited group sizes and sanitization." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 249-163. The bill never became law. \[House Vote 171, [7/29/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll171.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/171?1); Congressional Actions, [H.R.7027](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7027/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+7027%22%5D%7d&s=1&r=1)\]

-   **The Bill Provided \$50 Billion In Emergency Funding To Child Care Providers So That Parents Couold Get Back To Work.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "House Democrats muscled through \$229 billion in tax breaks and appropriations aimed at shoring up and reopening child care services shuttered by COVID-19 that American families will rely on as they head back to work. The first bill (HR 7027) would provide \$50 billion in emergency funding to cover providers' expenses and help them reopen or stay open." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5970201?3)\]

-   **Republicans Objected That The Grants Could Be Used For The Fixed Costs Of Daycare Providers, Unlike Other Relief Programs Such As The Paycheck Protection Program.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans objected that unlike other business relief programs, like the Paycheck Protection Program, this emergency funding would not only pay for salaries and everyday expenses but could also be used for the fixed costs of daycare providers." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5970201?3)\]

### Paid Leave

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against The American Rescue Plan Act Of 2021, Which Extended And Expanded Paid Sick And Family Leave Tax Credits For Employers Through September 2021.** In March 2021, Schweikert voted against concurring in the Senate amendment to the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "expand and extend through September 2021 paid sick and family leave tax credits for employers." The vote was on concurring in the Senate amendment to the bill. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote of 220-211 and sent to the President and ultimately the bill became law. \[House Vote 72, [3/10/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll072.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/10/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/72?24); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1319](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/actions)\]

-   **The American Rescue Plan Extended The Families First Coronavirus Response Act Through September 30, 2021, Which Allowed Eligible Employers Who Choose To Offer Paid Leave Benefits To Receive Tax Credits.** According to MVP Law, "On March 18, 2020 the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) was signed into law in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The FFCRA mandatory paid leave requirements expired on December 31, 2020, but the tax credits continued for employers who chose to voluntarily offer the leave through March 31, 2021. \[...\] The FFCRA still remains optional to eligible employers, those with fewer than 500 employees, but expands the program through September 30, 2021. This means that any eligible employer who pays the FFCRA paid leave benefits will continue to receive dollar for dollar tax credits." \[MVP Law, [4/6/21](https://mvplaw.com/ffcra-leave-expanded-under-american-rescue-plan/)\]

-   **The American Rescue Plan Would Not Mandate Paid And Emergency Family Leave, But It Incentived Small And Medium-Sized Businesses To Provide Paid Leave Through The Families First Coronavirus Response Act And Pandemic-Related Reasons.** According to SHRM, "Like the last stimulus package passed in December, the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA)---signed into law March 11---doesn't require Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) paid and emergency family leave. But ARPA does extend and expand the FFCRA tax credits, incentivizing small and midsize employers to provide paid time off for FFCRA and new COVID-19-related reasons." \[SHRM, [3/15/21](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/employment-law/pages/arpa-does-not-require-leave.aspx)\]

The vote was on concurring in the Senate amendment to the bill. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote of 220-211 and sent to the President and ultimately the bill became law. \[House Vote 72, [3/10/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll072.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/10/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/72?24); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1319](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/actions)\]

It would modify the PPP to make expenses paid for by loans tax deductible and establish set-asides for very small businesses and community financial institutions. It would terminate after 2020 and rescind unobligated amounts for certain Federal Reserve emergency lending facilities created during the pandemic." The vote was on concurring in Senate amendment with portion of the amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 359-53 and sent to the President and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 251, [12/21/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll251.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/21/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/251?0); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 133](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/133/actions)\]

**2020: Schweikert Voted To Extend The SBA Paycheck Protection Program Through December 31, 2020.** In May 2020, Schweikert voted for the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "extend and modify the Small Business Association\'s Paycheck Protection Program. Specifically it would allow loans to be issued through Dec. 31, 2020, and allow expenses to qualify for loan forgiveness through the earlier of 24 weeks after a loan is granted or Dec. 31. It would decrease from 75 to 60 percent the amount of funding that a recipient must use for payroll costs to qualify for loan forgiveness and eliminate a prohibition making recipients ineligible to defer 2020 employer payroll taxes." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 417-1. The bill later passed in the Senate by voice vote and was signed into law by the President. \[House Vote 114, [5/28/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll114.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/28/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/114?10); Congressional Actions, [H.R.7010](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7010/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Lowered The Amount Of PPP Loans That Small Businesses Must Use For Payrolls And Extend The Time In Which Borrowers Could Use The Loans.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House passed a bill to cut small businesses more slack in how they use coronavirus lifeline loans by and overwhelming margin Thursday. The bill would amend the Small Business Administration's so-called Paycheck Protection Program, which provides forgivable loans to companies affected by COVID-19 that need not be repaid if the money is used for payroll and some fixed costs, like rent. The measure would lower the amount of a loan that must be used for payrolls and give borrowers more time to use them." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/28/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5917067?3)\]

-   **The House Bill Provided More Flexibility Than The Senate Bill, Which Extended The Timeline To 16 Weeks Rather Than 24, And Did Not Loosen The Payroll Spending Requirement.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House-passed bill is different from a bipartisan measure the Senate tried to 'hotline' on May 21 before leaving for that chamber\'s Memorial Day break, but it ran into unknown objections. That bill (S 3833), backed by the bipartisan leadership of the Senate Small Business Committee, would have only lengthened the time period to use the loans from eight weeks to 16 weeks. That Senate bill would not loosen the existing 75 percent payroll spending requirement. But it would allow businesses to spend the money on personal protective equipment and other infection-preventing investments, provisions that aren\'t in the version passed by the House." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/28/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5917067?3)\]

**2020: Schweikert Voted For Requiring The SBA Make Information Related To The Paycheck Protection Program Publicly Available And Searchable Online.** In May 2020, Schweikert voted for the TRUTH act that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require the Small Business Administration, within 30 days of enactment, to make certain information related to the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program publicly available and searchable online. Specifically, it would require information on any program disbursements of over \$2 million, including to identify recipients and lenders or intermediaries and to describe the decision-making process for such disbursements. It would also require information on the amount of assistance provided to small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, women, and veterans. The bill would also effectively separate the authorization cap for the Paycheck Protection Program from other SBA 7(a) small business loan guarantee programs." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House rejected the motion, which required a two-thirds majority, by a vote of 269-147. \[House Vote 113, [5/28/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll113.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/28/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/113?9); Congressional Actions, [H.R.6782](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6782/all-actions)\]

-   **Democrats Compromised And Only Required Businesses Disclose Loans Greater Than \$2 Million, But The Bill Failed Because It Was Considered Under Suspension Of The Rules And Required A Supermajority.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House rejected \[the bill\] that would require the SBA to disclose who received PPP and SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program money and how much they got, plus some demographic information. The vote was 269-147, but it was considered under suspension of the rules and required a two-thirds supermajority. The SBA has put out aggregate figures on PPP lending, but so far has not disclosed specific information \[...\] Phillips said he did not expect the bill to fail after compromising with Republicans and changing the bill from requiring disclosure of all loans to only those above \$2 million." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/28/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5917067?1)\]
