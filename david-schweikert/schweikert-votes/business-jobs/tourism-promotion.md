### Creating A National Advisory Committee On Travel And Tourism Infrastructure

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Creating A National Advisory Committee On Travel And Tourism Infrastructure Designed To Advise The Transportation Secretary On Infrastructure Issues Related To Tourism.** In November 2015, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[ed\] the establishment of a National Advisory Committee on Travel and Tourism Infrastructure to advise the Transportation secretary on infrastructure issues and funding needs related to the use of the intermodal transportation network in facilitating travel and tourism, identify critical transportation facilities and corridors, and other duties." The underlying legislation was a surface transportation reauthorization. The vote was on the amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 216 to 207. The final legislation signed into law included the policy. \[House Vote 589, [11/3/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll589.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/3/15](http://cq.com/vote/2015/H/589?7); Congress.gov, [114-94](https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ94/PLAW-114publ94.pdf); Congressional Actions, [H.
