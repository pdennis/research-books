### Preventing Companies That Do Not Give Their Employees Adequate Annual Raises From Claiming Tax Deductions For Millionaire Executives

**2015: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Preventing Companies That Do Not Give Their Employees Adequate Annual Raises From Claiming Tax Deductions For Millionaire Executives.** In January 2015, Schweikert voted against a motion that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "commit\[ted\] the resolution to a select committee comprised of the House majority and minority leaders and report it back immediately with an amendment that would prevent companies that don't give their employees annual raises to keep pace with increases in costs of living and labor productivity from claiming tax deductions for chief executive officer bonuses or other compensation exceeding \$1 million for other highly-paid executives or employees." The underlying resolution was the House's organizing resolution. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 168 to 243. \[House Vote 5, [1/6/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll005.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/6/15](http://cq.com/vote/2015/H/5?4); Congressional Actions, [H.
