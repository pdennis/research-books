# Export-Import Bank

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Reauthorizing The Export-Import Bank.** In October 2015, Schweikert voted against reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "reauthorize\[d\] the Import-Export Bank's charter through fiscal 2019. The bill would \[have\] reduce\[d\], from \$140 billion to \$135 billion, the limit on the amount of loans, guarantees and insurance the bank could have outstanding at any given time, and would prohibit the bank from issuing new loans if the default rate reaches or exceeds two percent. It would \[have\] also direct\[ed\] the bank to increase the minimum amount of its financing required to be dedicated to small business from 20 to 25 percent. The measure would \[have\] also establish\[ed\] chief risk officer and chief ethics officer positions, and would \[have\] require\[d\] the bank to be subject to an audit by the Government Accountability Office audit every four years." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 313 to 118. The Senate did not take action on the bill, but the Bank was reauthorized by separate legislation. \[House Vote 576, [10/27/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll576.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/27/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/576?25); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 527](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/597/all-actions); Wall Street Journal, [12/9/15](http://www.wsj.com/articles/export-import-bank-set-for-renewal-1449265587)\]

EXIM is here to support your business. The Bank is an independent federal agency that fills gaps in private export finance in order to bolster U.S. job growth at no cost to American taxpayers. EXIM provides trade financing solutions -- including export credit insurance, working capital guarantees, and guarantees of commercial loans to foreign buyers -- to empower exporters of U.S. goods and services." \[Export Import Bank "What We Do," [Accessed 10/9/15](http://www.exim.gov/what-we-do)\]

-   **The Export-Import Bank Expired At The End Of June.** According to USA Today, "The charter for the Export-Import Bank of the United States expires at midnight Tuesday, delivering at least a short-term victory for fiscal conservatives and activists who targeted the 81-year-old institution as a free market distortion. \[...\] Congress failed to address the charter\'s expiration before they adjourned for the July 4 recess, but the bank\'s supporters say they will seek to renew the charter retroactively next month." \[USA Today, [7/1/15](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/30/export-import-bank-expiring-congress/29468333/)\]

-   **The White House: The Export-Import Bank "Financed The Sale Of More Than \$200 Billion In U.S. Exports Over The Last Six Years," Assists Small Business And Does Not Cost Taxpayers Money.** According to the White House, "The \[Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im)\] has financed the sale of more than \$200 billion in U.S. exports over the last six years, supporting over 1.3 million private-sector American jobs, including 164,000 jobs in Fiscal Year 2014 alone. Last year, Ex-Im financed the sale of \$27.5 billion in exports through more than 3,700 transactions, including nearly \$16.6 billion in manufacturing exports---and jobs supported by exports are good jobs, paying up to 18 percent more on average than other jobs.\[\...\] In FY 2014, nearly 90 percent of Ex-Im's transactions---more than 3,340---directly supported American small businesses. \[...\] Ex-Im doesn't cost taxpayers a penny. In fact, due to fees and interest, the Bank generated \$675 million in returns for taxpayers last year." \[The White House, [6/30/15](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/06/30/fact-sheet-export-import-bank-supporting-american-exports-and-american)\]

### Elimination

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating The Export-Import Bank.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted for a budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555, [10/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll555.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/5/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/555?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **The House Bill Was Not Taken Up In The Senate.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House passed a bill Friday that would reauthorize the Export-Import Bank for 10 years and rename it the U.S. Export Finance Agency, but Republicans say the bill is doomed in the Senate. Instead, GOP members expect to attach a shorter, clean reauthorization of the Ex-Imp Bank to the continuing resolution to keep the government open past Nov. 21, the date that both federal funding authority and Ex-Im's charter will expire." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/15/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5770389?40)\]

-   **Republicans Opposed The Export-Import Reauthorization Bill Because It Didn't Include Language Blocking Financing For Chinese State-Owned Enterprises.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "House Republicans attributed their opposition to provisions missing from the bill that were included in another reauthorization measure that would have blocker financing for Chinese state-owned enterprises." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/15/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5770389?40)\]

According to Congressional Quarterly, the conference report would have "reauthorize\[d\] the Export-Import Bank for four years and reduces the bank's lending caps. It also includes provisions intended to increase accountability and transparency at the bank and directs the president to initiate negotiations to reduce and eventually eliminate government export subsidies worldwide." The underlying legislation would have "reauthorize\[d\] federal-aid highway and transit programs for five years, through fiscal 2020, at increased levels." The vote was on the conference report. The House approved the legislation by a vote of 359 to 65.

-   **A Discharge Petition Is A Rare Move That "Circumvent\[s\]" House Leadership That "Basically Allows A Simple Majority Of The House To Force The House To Vote."** According to USA Today, "The House launched a rare effort Monday to circumvent Republican leadership in hopes of reviving the Export-Import Bank, which conservatives managed to choke off earlier this year. The procedure, known as a 'discharge petition,' basically allows a simple majority of the House to force the House to vote to extend the bank\'s charter. In the Monday vote, 62 Republicans joined 184 Democrats to exceed the 218 votes needed to force the bill to the House floor over the objections of 177 GOP lawmakers. A final vote to extend the bank\'s charter through 2019 will likely come Tuesday." \[USA Today, [10/26/15](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/26/house-uses-rare-proceedure-revive-export-import-bank/74638836/)\]
