It would increase from \$5.5 million to \$6.5 million the maximum loan amount for projects by small manufacturers. It would expand the list of policy goals for loan-eligible projects to include workforce development through training programs, expansion of employee-owned business development, reducing costs through the use of energy efficient products and generating renewable energy, aid for areas affected by disasters and expansion of businesses with 10 or fewer employees.
