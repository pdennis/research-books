### Equality Act

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against The Equality Act, Which Would Provide LGBTQ Anti-Discriminatory Protections By Prohibiting Discrimination On The Basis Of Sex, Sexual Orientation And Gender Identity Under The 1964 Civil Rights Act.** In February 2021, Schweikert voted against the Equality Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit discrimination or segregation based on sex, sexual orientation and gender identity under 1964 Civil Rights Act protections, including in public facilities, public education, federal assistance programs, employment, jury service and areas of public accommodation." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 224-206. \[House Vote 39, [2/25/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll039.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/25/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/39?38); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5/actions)\]

-   **Democrats Argued That The Equality Act Would Aid People From Losing Their Homes Or Employment On The Basis Of Their Sexual Orientation Or Gender Identity.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Democrats who supported the bill (HR 5) argued it would prevent people from losing their homes or jobs on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/25/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6137848?2)\]

-   **Republicans Claimed The Equality Act Would Hinder Religious Freedom And Put Women In Danger.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "In floor debate over the measure, Republicans claimed the bill would stomp on religious freedom and potentially endanger women.

-   **According To The Human Rights Campaign, At Least 70% Of The Public Supported The Equality Act.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "David Stacy, the government affairs director for the LGBTQ rights group Human Rights Campaign, said that federal law already provides protections for religious freedom and cited significant public support for the bill. His organization has cited polls conducted by HRC and others showing 70 percent or more of the public support the bill." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/25/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6137848?2)\]

-   **According To Various Democrats, The Equality Act Would Not Hinder Religious Liberty, But Instead Grant Gender Identity And Sexual Orientation The Same Protections As Other Established Categories Within Civil Rights Law.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Democrats like Cicilline said the bill doesn\'t touch religious liberty exemptions that already exist in the law. It only gives sexual orientation and gender identity the same protections as other categories such as race. 'All of the other areas of civil rights law have established religious exemptions, they would apply in the same way to the provisions of the Equality Act. The LGBTQ community is not looking for more protections, nor are we willing to accept less,' Cicilline said." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/25/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6137848?5)\]

-   **Several Religious Groups Lobbied Against The Equality Act And Claimed The Measure Challenged Religious Liberties By Not Creating Religious Exemptions.** According to The Washington Post, "A number of religious denominations, however, are lobbying against the measure, saying its lack of religious exemptions creates one of the most sweeping challenges to religious liberty in decades." \[The Washington Post, [2/26/21](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/congress-sexual-orientation-civil-rights-gender/2021/02/25/1351bea4-7779-11eb-8115-9ad5e9c02117_story.html)\]

-   **The House Freedom Caucus Attacked The Equality Act And Claimed It Was "A Broader Liberal Attack On Traditional Christian Values."** According to The Washington Post, "Members of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus delivered a broad attack on the substance of the bill Thursday, with many calling it part of a broader liberal attack on traditional Christian values." \[The Washington Post, [2/26/21](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/congress-sexual-orientation-civil-rights-gender/2021/02/25/1351bea4-7779-11eb-8115-9ad5e9c02117_story.html)\]

-   **The Equality Act Would Modify The Civil Rights Act Of 1964 To Include Protections Against Discrimination Based On Sexual Orientation And Gender Identity.** According to NPR, "The Equality Act would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to explicitly prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity." \[NPR, [2/24/21](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/24/969591569/house-to-vote-on-equality-act-heres-what-the-law-would-do)\]

-   **An Entity Would Not Be Able To Use The Religious Freedom Restoration Act Of 1993 To Challenge The Equality Act's Provisions, Nor Would It Be Used As A Defense To A Claim.** According to NPR, "Under the Equality Act, an entity couldn't use RFRA to challenge the act's provisions, nor could it use RFRA as a defense to a claim made under the act." \[NPR, [2/24/21](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/24/969591569/house-to-vote-on-equality-act-heres-what-the-law-would-do)\]

-   **Some Opponents Of The Equality Act Claimed It Would Threaten Business And Organizations That Object Serving LGBTQ On The Basis Of Religious Objections And Force Them To Choose Between Their Beliefs Or Continuing To Operate.** According to NPR, "Another key fear among opponents of the Equality Act is that it would threaten businesses or organizations that have religious objections to serving LGBTQ people, forcing them to choose between operating or following their beliefs." \[NPR, [2/24/21](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/24/969591569/house-to-vote-on-equality-act-heres-what-the-law-would-do)\]

-   **The Equality Act Would Place Protections Against Discrimination Based On Sexual Orientation And Gender Identity, Instead Of Having Those Protections Under The Broad Term Of "Sex."** According to CBS News, "The Equality Act would explicitly set those protections for people based on orientation and gender identity, as opposed to having those safeguards included under the umbrella term of 'sex.'" \[CBS News, [2/26/21](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-passes-equality-act-lgbtq-american-rights/)\]

-   **The Equality Act Would Benefit Members Of The LGBTQ Community And Women, Who Would No Longer Be Denied Services By Health Care Establishments.** According to Center For American Progress, "The Equality Act would establish sex and SOGI protections in public accommodations. This means that businesses open to the public, such as restaurants and pharmacies, would face accountability if they discriminate against, mistreat, or refuse to serve LGBTQ individuals. These amendments would not only benefit LGBTQ individuals; all women could no longer be charged higher prices than men for equivalent services or be denied services by establishments that provide health care." \[Center For American Progress, [3/15/21](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/need-know-equality-act/)\]

-   **The Equality Act Would Expand The Range Of Public Accommodations To Include Health Care Providers.** According to Center For American Progress, "By expanding the range of public accommodations recognized under civil rights law, the Equality Act would ensure protections for race, color, religion, national origin, and sex, including SOGI, in public spaces, including retail stores, transportation, and health care providers." \[Center For American Progress, [3/15/21](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/need-know-equality-act/)\]

-   **Op-Ed: By Adding "Sex" To Discrimination Laws That Would Require Public Accommodations Regarding Pregnancy, Childbirth Or Related Medical Condition, The Equality Act Would Consider A Form Of Sex Discrimination For A Health Care Provider To Refuse Abortion Services.** According to The Daily Signal op-ed by Melanie Israel, "The Equality Act adds the term 'sex' to Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights Act on public accommodations to mean pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Both the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals have interpreted 'related medical condition' to include abortion. Because of the way the Equality Act is drafted, this new definition of sex discrimination---understood to include a medical condition such as abortion---would be applied to areas of law, such as federally assisted programs, public accommodations, and Obamacare's nondiscrimination provision. In practice, it could mean that a health care provider would be discriminating on the basis of sex if they refused to perform an abortion procedure; a hospital could be discriminating on the basis of sex if it refused to allow abortions to take place within its facility; and health insurance plans could be discriminating on the basis of sex if they do not include coverage for elective abortions." \[Melanie Israel Op-Ed -- The Daily Signal, [2/22/21](https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/02/22/equality-act-is-trojan-horse-for-abortion-lobby-and-more/?_gl=1*1fqtjp3*_ga*MTE4MzA5OTMzMy4xNjkwNTcwMTk5*_ga_W14BT6YQ87*MTY5MDU3MDE5OC4xLjAuMTY5MDU3MDE5OC42MC4wLjA.)\]

More than 8 in 10 Americans favor laws that would protect LGBTQ people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations and housing, according to a 2020 Public Religion Research Institute American Values Survey." \[The Washington Post, [2/26/21](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/congress-sexual-orientation-civil-rights-gender/2021/02/25/1351bea4-7779-11eb-8115-9ad5e9c02117_story.html)\]

Cicilline (D-R.I.), the chief sponsor of the measure." \[The Washington Post, [2/26/21](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/congress-sexual-orientation-civil-rights-gender/2021/02/25/1351bea4-7779-11eb-8115-9ad5e9c02117_story.html)\]

-   **The Equality Act Would Amend Civil Rights Laws To Guarantee Protections For The LGBTQ Community In Areas, Including Employment, Education, Housing, Credit, Jury Duty, And More.** According to The Washington Post, "The legislation would amend federal civil rights laws to ensure protections for LGBTQ Americans in employment, education, housing, credit, jury service and other areas." \[The Washington Post, [2/26/21](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/congress-sexual-orientation-civil-rights-gender/2021/02/25/1351bea4-7779-11eb-8115-9ad5e9c02117_story.html)\]

-   **The Equality Act Would Expand Public Accommodations And Covered Discrimination To Federally Funded Programs.** According to NPR, "The Civil Rights Act covered discrimination in certain areas, like employment and housing.

Because of that, many types of discrimination the Civil Rights Act currently prohibits --- like racial or religious discrimination --- would now also be explicitly covered at those types of establishments." \[NPR, [2/24/21](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/24/969591569/house-to-vote-on-equality-act-heres-what-the-law-would-do)\]

'While it attacks religious freedom, freedom of expression and freedom of association, all important rights recognized in the first amendment, it doesn't stop there, it also denies the biological facts that men and women are the two genders,' he said Thursday. 'The bill recklessly requires girl's and women's restrooms, lockers, gyms, or any place a female might seek privacy, to surrender that privacy to biological males.

-   **Many Republicans May Have Voted Against The Measure Because It Included Protections Against LGBTQ Discriminations, While Democrats Opposed The Measure Due To Amendments On Sanctuary Cities, The Iran Deal And The North Carolina Bathroom Bill.** In According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House rejected, 112-305, a \$37.4 billion Energy-Water fiscal 2017 spending bill on Thursday over the addition of a host of policy riders tenuously associated with the agencies funded by the bill, including one related to LGBT anti-discrimination. With a run of Republican-sponsored amendments adopted Wednesday night --- including provisions dealing with the federal government's response to the North Carolina bathroom law, illegal immigration 'sanctuary cities' and the Iran nuclear deal --- the bill (HR 5055) apparently became only more toxic to House Democrats. The inclusion of a Democratic amendment on LGBT discrimination, from Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., meanwhile, appears to have made the bill toxic to Republicans as well. The amendment would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in federal contracts. The amendment caused chaos last week on the Military Construction-VA spending bill (HR 4974) when Republican leadership conducted a last-minute whipping operation on the House floor." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/26/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4897951?26)\]

That bill passed the House on a party-line vote Wednesday night, but the White House has indicated it would veto the NDAA as it\'s currently written in part because of its endorsement of discrimination." \[Think Progress, [5/19/16](http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2016/05/19/3779986/house-republicans-include-lgbt-discrimination-in-ndaa/)\]

-   **House Republican Leadership Kept The Vote Open To Ensure That The Amendment Failed, With The Democrats Chanting 'Shame" As A Result.** According to POLITICO, "The House erupted in chaos Thursday morning with Democrats crying foul after Republicans hastily persuaded a few of their own to switch their votes and narrowly block an amendment intended to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from discrimination It was an unruly scene on the floor with Democrats chanting, 'Shame!' after GOP leaders barely muscled up the votes to reject, 212-213, an amendment by Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) that would have effectively barred federal contractors from getting government work if they discriminate against the LGBT community. At one point, a monitor in the House gallery showed there were 217 votes supporting the legislation, eliciting cheers of joy from Democrats who thought the measure might actually pass. But over the course of about 10 minutes, those votes suddenly dropped one by one to 212 --- and the amendment failed." \[POLITICO, [5/19/16](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/house-lgbt-amendment-discrimination-fight-223366)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted For An FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, Which Included A Provisions Which Would Effectively Allow Federal Contractors To Discriminate Against LGBT Employees.** In May 2016, Schweikert voted for an FY 2017 NDAA, which authorized over \$600 billion for discretionary defense program and included a provisions allowing federal contractors to discriminate against LGTB emplyees. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "specifie\[d\] that the government, when awarding contracts or grants to any religious organization, must abide by the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act (PL 101-336). (Many members believe that this language would effectively supplant a July 2014 executive order by President Obama that added sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of list of protected categories that apply to federal contractors and their employees. Opponents of that executive order argue that it requires religious organizations receiving government money to override their religious beliefs when offering services.)" The underlying legislation would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "authorize\[d\] \$602.2 billion in discretionary funding for defense programs in fiscal 2017. The total would \[have\] include\[d\] \$58.8 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations funding, of which \$23.1 billion of would be used for non-war, base defense budget needs."

-   **Think Progress: Provision Would Allow Federal Contractors To Discriminate Against LGTB Employees.** According to Think Progress, "Republican leaders in Congress have quashed a bipartisan attempt to remove the so-called Russell Amendment --- a sweeping 'religious liberty' provision that would allow federal contractors to discriminate against LGBT employees --- from this year's National Defense Authorization Act. The defense budget bill now heads to the floor of the House with the anti-LGBT language attached, prompting furious backlash from lawmakers, civil rights groups, and the Obama Administration." \[Think Progress, [5/18/16](http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2016/05/18/3779536/house-defense-lgbt-amendment/)\]
