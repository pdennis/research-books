### Barring Displays Of Confederate Flag Imagery In VA Cemeteries

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Bar Displays Of Confederate Flag Imagery In VA Cemeteries.** In May 2016, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have prevented funds from an FY 2017 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs approbations bill from being used to display Confederate flag imagery at Veterans Affairs cemeteries. According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have "prohibit\[ed\] the use of appropriated funds to display Confederate flag imagery in Veterans Administration cemeteries." The underlying legislation was an FY 2017 Military Construction and VA appropriations bill. The vote was on the amendment. The House approved the amendment by a vote of 265 to 159. The House later passed the underlying bill with the amendment's policy, but the Senate took no substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 223, [5/19/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll223.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/19/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/223?38); Congress.gov, [H.R. 4974](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4974); Congressional Actions, [H.
