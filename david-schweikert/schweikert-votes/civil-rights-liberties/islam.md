### Studying Only Islam's Link To Terrorism

**2017: Schweikert Voted To Study Islam's Links To Terrorism.** In July 2017, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] the secretary of Defense to conduct two concurrent strategic assessments of the use of violent or unorthodox Islamic religious doctrine to support extremist or terrorist messaging and justification, and would \[have\] require\[d\] the secretary to submit to Congress the results of the assessments." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 defense authorization. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 208 to 217. \[House Vote 372, [7/13/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll372.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/13/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/372?3); Congressional Actions, [H.
