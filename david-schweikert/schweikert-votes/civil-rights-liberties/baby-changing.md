### Requiring Most Public Bathrooms In Federal Buildings, Including Men's Rooms, To Have Baby Changing Facilities

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Require Most Public Bathrooms In Federal Buildings, Including Men's Rooms, To Have Baby Changing Facilities.** In September 2016, Schweikert voted for legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] that the public restrooms in most federal buildings, except those that are not open to the public or in which the modifications would not be feasible, be equipped with baby-changing facilities that are physically safe, sanitary and appropriate. This requirement would \[have\] be\[en\] subject to any reasonable accommodations that could be made for individuals in accordance with disability laws." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 389 to 34. The Senate then passed the legislation by unanimous consent and then, President Obama signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 541, [9/21/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll541.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/21/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/541?2); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5147](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5147/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Was In Part A Response To Societal Changes Recognizing That Both Men And Women Are Primary Caregivers.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The growing recognition in our society that both men and women are primary caregivers for their infant children, that all parents would like to be able to take their babies with them while performing the regular tasks of their lives and that all parents would like to have access to sanitary conditions in which to tend their children\'s needs has led to various legislative proposals to require that appropriate baby-changing facilities be available in bathrooms for both men and women." \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/16/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4958334/33?7)\]
