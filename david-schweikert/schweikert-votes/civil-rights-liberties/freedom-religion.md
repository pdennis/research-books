# Freedom From Religion

### Barring The Military From Appointing Chaplains Not Endorsed By A "Qualified Religious Organization"

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Bar The Military From Appointing Chaplains Not Endorsed By A "Qualified Religious Organization."** In July 2013, Schweikert voted for an amendment that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would bar the use of funds in the bill to appoint chaplains that have not been endorsed by a qualified religious organization." The vote was on an amendment to the House's version of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2014. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 253 to 173. The House later passed the underlying bill, but the Senate took no substantive action on it directly. \[House Vote 392, [7/23/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll392.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/23/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/floorvote-240992000); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 375](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/375/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2397](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2397/all-actions)\]

-   **The Amendment Aimed At Blocking Potential Efforts To Have The Military Allow Atheist Or Humanist Chaplains.** According to KLTV, "Introduced by Louisiana Rep. John Fleming, the amendment is designed to head off an effort to allow atheists and 'humanist' chaplains, by preventing the Department of Defense from appointing chaplains without an endorsing agency." \[KLTV, [7/26/13](http://www.kltv.com/story/22937403/fleming-amendment-blocking-atheist-chaplains-passes-house)\]

-   **The Department Of Defense Currently Requires Chaplains To Be Endorsed By A Registered Religious Faith Organization, Excluding Non-Organized Religions As Well As Atheists.** According to KLTV, "The Department of Defense requires an ecclesiastical endorsement from a religious faith organization registered with the Department of Defense, which specifically rules out secular organizations. It allows the Department of Defense a way of determining the eligibility and competence of those who seek the role.  Without centralized organization, some religions that are recognized by the U.S. military  - including Wicca and Paganism - have yet to be represented among the chaplain corps." \[KLTV, [7/26/13](http://www.kltv.com/story/22937403/fleming-amendment-blocking-atheist-chaplains-passes-house)\]

-   **There Were 9,400 Self-Identified Atheists Or Agnostics In The Military, More Than The Number Of Jews, Muslims, Hindus Or Buddhists.** According to KLTV, "Defense Department statistics appear to back up Muscato's claims, showing that about 9,400 of the nation's 1.4 million active-duty military personnel identify themselves as atheists or agnostics, making them a larger subpopulation than Jews, Muslims, Hindus or Buddhists in the military." \[KLTV, [7/26/13](http://www.kltv.com/story/22937403/fleming-amendment-blocking-atheist-chaplains-passes-house)\]

-   **Amendment's Sponsor Said An Atheist Chaplain Was Nonsensical And An Oxymoron.** According to the Times-Picayune, "'The notion of an atheist chaplain is nonsensical; it's an oxymoron,' said Rep. John Fleming, R-Minden, sponsor of the amendment to a House defense spending bill. He said it marks the third time the House has voted to insist the Pentagon appoint only chaplains certified by endorsing religious agencies." \[Times-Picayune, [7/24/13](http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/07/house_passes_fleming_measure_t.html)\]

-   **Rep. Fleming: There Are Only A Small Number Of Atheists In Military, And Other Chaplains Would Be Available To Them.** According to KLTV, "Fleming dismisses statistics offered by atheist organizations about the religious demographics of the military, suggesting that they are exaggerated. 'In reality, less than one percent of service members identify themselves as atheists, and all chaplains stand ready to serve any member of the Armed Forces, regardless of whether he or she shares the chaplain's faith.'" \[KLTV, [7/26/13](http://www.kltv.com/story/22937403/fleming-amendment-blocking-atheist-chaplains-passes-house)\]

-   **Opponents Said Non-Religious Service Members Should Also Have The Option Of Going To A Faith Advisor, Rather Than The More Socially Risky Mental Health Professional.** According to The Hill, "Democrats insisted that nonreligious service members should be able to confide in an adviser in a way that does not create a stigma. 'Going to a mental health professional is a choice that is laden with risk and some controversy for a member of the service,' Rep. Robert Andrews (D-N.J.) said. 'Going to a faith adviser is not.'" \[The Hill, [6/14/13](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/305603-house-kills-dem-proposal-allowing-non-religious-military-chaplains)\]

-   **Opponents Said It Would Be Wrong To Reduce Military's Flexibility On Chaplains.** According to the Times-Picayune, "Opponents said it is wrong to take away the flexibility of the military to appoint chaplains that can serve the spiritual needs of all military personnel." \[Times-Picayune, [7/24/13](http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/07/house_passes_fleming_measure_t.html)\]

-   **Opponents Said Constitution Required Government To Treat Military Personnel Of All Faiths Equally.** According to the Congressional Record, Rep. Robert Andrews (D-NJ) said, "Mr. Chairman, our intent is not to promote institutionalized godlessness. Our intent is to promote constitutional fealty. When a young man or young woman raises their right hand and swears allegiance to this country and agrees to serve in the Armed Forces, they do not consign themselves to serve as a second-class citizen, irrespective of their faith or their life philosophy. It is wrong to say to a soldier who comes from such a tradition, that he or she, if they have an issue on which they're troubled, must go to a mental health professional in order to receive counseling, rather than someone who comes from their philosophical faith or tradition. The other problem with this amendment is it frankly second guesses the military leadership of this country, the Pentagon of this country, the Defense Department, and says that even if they would decide that such a decision would be appropriate, they're prohibited from doing so. Our law recognizes that our Constitution establishes no religion. We should have equality of treatment for our Armed Forces. I'd urge a 'no' vote on this amendment." \[Congressional Record, [7/23/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-07-23/pdf/CREC-2013-07-23-pt1-PgH4936-3.pdf#page=7)\]
