-   **The Resolution Was Spurred By Additional Anti-Semitic Comments From Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN).** According to CNN, "The House of Representatives on Thursday passed a resolution broadly condemning hate and intolerance, including anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim discrimination, in the wake of controversy over Democratic freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar. \[...\] Omar, who has not shied away from criticizing the actions of the Israeli government, became embroiled in a backlash after saying at an event last week, 'I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.' The remark drew condemnation from several influential House Democrats. \[...\] House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said ahead of the vote on Thursday that she does not believe Omar's comments were 'intended in any anti-Semitic way' and that Omar may not understand 'the full weight' of how the remarks were interpreted." \[CNN, [3/7/19](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/07/politics/house-democrats-resolution-vote-ilhan-omar/index.html)\]

-   **The Resolution's Text Originally Only Focused On Anti-Semitism, But Was Made Broader.** According to CNN, "Draft text of the resolution was originally written to focus specifically on condemning anti-Semitism following outrage over Omar\'s remarks, but the text was later revised to include a denunciation of other forms of bigotry, including anti-Muslim bias." \[...\] But, \[Rep. Eliot\] Engel \[(D-NY)\] added, 'I wish we had had a separate resolution about anti-Semitism. I think we deserved it. I think it was wrong not to have it \... but I want to say very clearly and very loudly that anti-Semitism will never be tolerated by me.'" \[CNN, [3/7/19](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/07/politics/house-democrats-resolution-vote-ilhan-omar/index.html)\]

**2019: Schweikert Effectively Voted To Combat Anti-Semitism Around The World And To Strongly Support Israel .** In February 2019, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "state that Congress finds it is in the national security interest of the U.S. to combat anti-Semitism around the world and to strongly support Israel." The underlying legislation was a resolution demanding the removal of U.S. forces from the Saudi-lead war in Yemen. The House agreed to the motion to recommit, thereby amending the bill, by a vote of 424 to 0. The House later agreed to the underlying resolution. \[House Vote 82, [2/13/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll082.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/13/19](http://cq.com/vote/2019/H/82?1); Congressional Actions, [H.J. Res. 37](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-joint-resolution/37/all-actions)\]

-   **Amendment Was Added In Part Due To Recent Anti-Semitic Tweets From Rep. Omar (D-MN).** According to Roll Call, "The vote comes as Republicans and Democrats both condemned comments Rep. Ilhan Omar made on social media Sunday. The tweets, which Omar apologized for, suggested donations from the pro-Israel lobby are why lawmakers support the country. It was seen as an anti-Semitic trope." \[Roll Call, [2/13/19](https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/house-votes-to-take-stand-against-anti-semitism)\]
