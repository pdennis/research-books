### Federal Holiday Designation

**2021: Schweikert Voted To Designate Juneteenth National Independence Day As A Federal Holiday.** In June 2021, Schweikert voted for the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "designate Juneteenth National Independence Day, celebrated on June 19, as the eleventh national federal holiday." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 415-14, and was sent to the President and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 170, [6/16/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll170.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/16/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/170?22); Congressional Actions, [S. 475](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/475/actions)\]
