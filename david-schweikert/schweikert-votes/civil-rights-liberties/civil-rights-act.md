# Civil Rights Act

### Title VII

**2016: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Exempted Claims Seeking Relief Under Title VII Of The Civil Rights Act From Allowing A Federal Court To Apply More Stringent Rules For Who Can Sue In A Class-Action Lawsuit.** In January 2016, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "exempt\[ed\] claims seeking monetary relief under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act." The underlying bill would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] federal courts from certifying proposed classes of individuals for a class-action lawsuit unless each member of the class has suffered the same type and degree of injury. Additionally, the bill would \[have\] require\[d\] quarterly reports by asbestos trusts including claims made against the trusts and payouts made by the trusts for asbestos-related injuries." The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 163 to 221. \[House Vote 24, [1/8/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll024.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/8/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/24?32); Congressional Quarterly, [1/8/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/33?27); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Title VII Of The Civil Rights Act Prohibits Employment Discrimination Based On Sex, Race, Color, National Origin, And Religion.** According to the American Association of University Women, "Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a federal law that prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, and religion. It generally applies to employers with 15 or more employees, including federal, state, and local governments. Title VII also applies to private and public colleges and universities, employment agencies, and labor organizations." \[American Association of University Women, [Accessed 3/29/16](http://www.aauw.org/what-we-do/legal-resources/know-your-rights-at-work/title-vii/)\]
