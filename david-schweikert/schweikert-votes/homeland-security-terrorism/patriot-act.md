# Patriot Act

### 2015 Extension

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Prohibiting The National Security Agency's Bulk Collection And Storage Of Telephone Metadata, Require NSA To Obtain Approval By The FISA Court To Examine Calling Records On A Case By Case Basis And Extend Certain PATRIOT Act Programs.** In May 2015, Schweikert voted against the USA FREEDOM Act. According to Congressional Quarterly, the USA FREEDOM Act would have "modif\[ied\] domestic surveillance authorities by prohibiting the National Security Agency's bulk collection and storage of telephone metadata and ability to collect other bulk data. The measure would \[have\] require\[d\] the NSA to obtain approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to examine the calling records of individual target telephone numbers on a case-by-case basis, before the request for information is made to a phone company, and limit the associated calling records of a telephone number that may be examined to two 'hops' from the suspect\'s number - essentially codifying proposals made by the president in 2014. The bill also would \[have\] redefine\[d\] the type of information that may be subject to a search query under surveillance programs, impose additional surveillance oversight requirements, and extend\[ed\] until December 2019 the Patriot Act Section 215, roving wiretap and 'Lone Wolf' surveillance authorities." The vote was on the legislation. The House approved the bill by a vote of 338 to 88. The Senate passed the bill, which the president then signed into law. \[House Vote 224, [5/13/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll224.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/13/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/224?53); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2048](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2048/all-actions)\]
