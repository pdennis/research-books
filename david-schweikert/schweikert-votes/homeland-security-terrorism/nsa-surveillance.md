# NSA Surveillance

### Preventing 'Backdoor' Surveillance

**2015: Schweikert Voted For An Amendment That Would Have Prevented 'Backdoor' Surveillance.** In June 2015, Schweikert voted for an amendment that according to Congressional Quarterly, would have "restrict\[ed\] use of funds to query a collection of foreign intelligence information acquired under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 using a United States person identifier. The amendment also would \[have\] bar\[red\] use of funds by the National Security Agency or the Central Intelligence Agency to mandate that a company alter products or services to permit electronic surveillance of users, except for mandates or requests authorized under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act." The underlying legislation was the FY 16 Defense Appropriations. The House approved the amendment by a vote of 255 to 174. The House later passed the underlying bill, but it died in the Senate. \[House Vote 356, [6/11/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll356.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/11/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/356?16); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Electronic Frontier Foundation: Backdoor Surveillance Refers To When The NSA Collects Bulk Data, Then Searches The Data Without A Warrant.** According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, "Today, the US House of Representatives passed an amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill designed to cut funding for NSA backdoors. The amendment passed overwhelmingly with strong bipartisan support: 293 ayes, 123 nays, and 1 present. Currently, the NSA collects emails, browsing and chat history under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, and searches this information without a warrant for the communications of Americans---a practice known as 'backdoor searches.' The amendment would block the NSA from using any of its funding from this Defense Appropriations Bill to conduct such warrantless searches. In addition, the amendment would prohibit the NSA from using its budget to mandate or request that private companies and organizations add backdoors to the encryption standards that are meant to keep you safe on the web." \[Electronic Frontier Foundation, [6/19/14](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/06/eff-statement-massie-lofgren-amendment-passing-house)\]
