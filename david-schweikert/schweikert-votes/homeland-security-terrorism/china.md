### Condemning Chinse Surveillance Balloon

**2023: Schweikert Voted To Condemn China For Using A High-Altitude Balloon To Surveil U.S. Territory And Request The Biden Administration TO Provide Briefings On Prior Instances Of China Violating U.S. Airspaces.** In February 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for a resolution that would "state that the House of Representatives condemns China's use, in February 2023, of a high-altitude balloon to conduct surveillance over United States territory and its 'efforts to deceive the international community ... about its intelligence collection campaigns.' It would state that the Feb. 2 incident was a 'brazen violation of United States sovereignty' and that it should be U.S. policy to take prompt action to prevent foreign aerial surveillance platforms from violating U.S. sovereignty. It would further request that the Biden administration provide comprehensive briefings to Congress on the issue, including on prior instances of China violating U.S. airspace; the timeline of events from the first detection of the balloon to its shootdown; surveillance data the balloon may have collected or transmitted; options identified to respond the balloon and timing of recommendations made by the military regarding the options; diplomatic communications with China regarding the incident; and the administration's plans to combat future intelligence collection activities by China and other adversaries in the national airspace system." The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 419 to 0. \[House Vote 117, [2/9/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll117.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/9/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/117?26); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 104](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/104/all-actions)\]

### Condemning Surveillance Balloon

**2023: Schweikert Voted To Condemn China's Use Of A High-Altitude Surveillance Balloon Over U.S. Territory.** In April 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Upholding Sovereignty of Airspace Act, which would "express the sense of Congress condemning China's use of a high-altitude surveillance balloon over U.S. airspace as an 'unacceptable violation' of U.S. sovereignty and urge a number of diplomatic actions and sanctions intended to neutralize similar, future threats and combat Chinese misinformation and propaganda about its intelligence collection efforts. The bill would require the State Department, in consultation with the National Intelligence director and the U.S. representative to the United Nations, to develop and report to Congress on a diplomatic strategy to inform allies and partners of the scope of China's surveillance program and build global consensus to address the program --- including to advocate for Taiwan's participation in International Civil Aviation Organization events and meetings; promote international coordination to identify and track future Chinese surveillance balloons, continue to share information regarding Chinese surveillance, and implement related sanctions; and advocate at the U.N. and other international organizations to increase diplomatic pressure on China to halt its surveillance collection operations that violate international sovereignty. The bill also would require the Commerce Department to evaluate U.S. export and transfer policies for aerospace items and technologies that are used by China for intelligence and reconnaissance, and to report to Congress, within 180 days, on the evaluations and a list of related controls it has implemented or plans to implement. It would authorize the president to impose property-blocking and visa sanctions against any Chinese individual that the president determines is 'directly managing and overseeing' the Chinese global surveillance balloon program." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 405 to 6, thus the bill was sent to the Senate for their consideration. \[House Vote 183, [4/17/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll183.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/17/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/183?2); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1151](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1151/all-actions)\]

The president could impose the sanctions as soon as 180 days after the legislation is enacted." \[The Hill, [4/17/23](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3955986-4-progressives-2-conservatives-vote-against-bill-to-hold-china-accountable-for-spy-balloon/)\]
