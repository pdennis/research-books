# Visa Waiver

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Restrict Individuals Who Have Traveled To Certain Nations Linked To Terrorism From Using The Visa Waiver Program.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted for legislation that would bar individuals who had visited certain nations from entering the country unless they were interviewed by U.S. officials and obtained a regular visa. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "prohibit\[ed\] individuals who have been to specified nations, including Syria, Iran, Sudan, and Iraq, from entering the United States unless they were interviewed by U.S. officials and obtained a regular visa, even if the individuals arrived from countries that participate in the Visa Waiver Program. The bill would \[have\] also update\[d\] requirements for countries to participate in the Visa Waiver Program; would \[have\] require\[d\] fraud-resistant electronic passports, biographic and biometric information; and would \[have\] require\[d\] participation in the program's electronic collection of information on all additional countries where an applicant has or had citizenship." The vote was on the legislation. The House passed the bill by a vote of 407 to 19. The Senate did not act on the legislation, but the bill's enhanced security checks in the visa waiver program was included in separate legislation that was signed into law. \[House Vote 679, [12/8/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll679.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/8/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/679?4); Congressional Quarterly, [12/16/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4807474?12); Congress.gov, [H.R. 158](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/158); NPR, [12/18/15](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/12/18/460281572/congress-sends-1-8-trillion-tax-and-spending-bill-to-president-obama)\]

-   **The Visa Waiver Program Allows Nationals From 38 Counties, Mostly European, To Enter The U.S. As Visitors For Up To 90- Days Without First Obtaining A Visa.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows nationals from 38 countries, 30 of which are in Europe, to enter the United States as visitors (nonimmigrants) for business or pleasure for up to 90 days without first obtaining a visa from a U.S. consulate abroad. Visitors from non-VWP countries must obtain a visa from the State Department, which involves undergoing biometric (i.e., fingerprint) security screening and a pre-trip interview with U.S. officials at a consular post abroad." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/4/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4801178/10?9&search=qmY9Q9lR)\]

-   **Legislation Would Bar Individuals Who Normally Could Enter The U.S. Through The Visa Waiver Program If They Visited Certain Nations Such As Iraq, Syria And Iran; Travelers Would Instead Have To Get A Regular Visa.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Under the measure, travelers wishing to visit the United States could not do so using the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) if they traveled to certain countries associated with international terrorism at any time on or after March 1, 2011 --- including Iraq, Syria, Iran and Sudan, or any other country designated by the Homeland Security Department. Instead, those individuals would have to obtain a regular visa from the State Department and undergo the biometric security screening and an interview with U.S. officials. Use of the visa waiver program also would not be available to nationals of those terrorist associated countries, even if they also hold a passport from one of the 38 visa waiver countries." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/4/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4801178/10?9&search=qmY9Q9lR)\]

-   **Legislation Would Exempt Individuals Who Were In Specified Nations Due To Military Service Or Other Government Related Activity.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill's restrictions do not apply to applicants from VWP nations who were in those terrorist associated nations performing military service or acting as a government official carrying out official duties. The Homeland Security Department (DHS) could also waive the prohibition for specific individuals if determined to be in the 'law enforcement or national security interests' of the United States. These person-specific waivers must be reported annually to Congress by the department." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/4/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4801178/10?9&search=qmY9Q9lR)\]

-   **November 2015 Paris Attacks Brought Scrutiny To The Visa Waiver Program Because Many Of The Terrorists Were European Nationals.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "In light of the November terrorist attacks in Paris, however, in which most the perpetrators were European nationals, there is increasing concern that citizens of VWP nations who have traveled to Syria or other nations to train with the Islamic State or other terrorist groups could use the program to enter the United States." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/4/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4801178/10?9&search=qmY9Q9lR)\]

-   **Visa Waiver Program Has Been A Boon For Tourism.** According to the New York Times, "While cracks in the visa-waiver program are worrisome to national security officials, business leaders see the program as a boon to tourism and the economy. Foreign tourists who come to the United States under the program are estimated to spend as much as \$100 billion a year, and advocates argue that tightening the program would deter tourism, a concern the White House shares. American tourists get similar waivers to travel to Europe and other friendly countries." \[New York Times, [11/30/15](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/01/us/politics/01visa.html)\]
