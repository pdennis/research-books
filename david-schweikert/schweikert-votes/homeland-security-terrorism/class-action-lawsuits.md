# Class-Action Lawsuits

### Exempting Terrorists From Allowing A Federal Court To Apply More Stringent Rules For Who Can Sue In A Class-Action Lawsuit

**2016: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Exempted A Terrorist From Allowing A Federal Court To Apply More Stringent Rules For Who Can Sue In A Class-Action Lawsuit.** In January 2016, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "exempt\[ed\] claims against the perpetrator of a terrorist attack by victims of the attack." The underlying bill would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] federal courts from certifying proposed classes of individuals for a class-action lawsuit unless each member of the class has suffered the same type and degree of injury. Additionally, the bill would \[have\] require\[d\] quarterly reports by asbestos trusts including claims made against the trusts and payouts made by the trusts for asbestos-related injuries." The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 158 to 211. \[House Vote 23, [1/8/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll023.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/8/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/23?31); Congressional Quarterly, [1/8/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/33?27); Congressional Actions, [H.
