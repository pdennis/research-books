# Detainees

### Habeas Corpus

**2013: Schweikert Voted Against Requiring The Government To Prove With Clear Evidence That A U.S. Citizen Picked Up Pursuant To The 2001 AUMF Is An Unprivileged Enemy Combatant In A Habeas Proceeding.** In June 2013, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] the government, in habeas proceedings for U.S. citizens apprehended in the United States pursuant to the 2001 use of force authorization, to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the citizen is an unprivileged enemy combatant and there is no presumption that the government\'s evidence is accurate and authentic." The underlying legislation was an FY 2014 defense authorization. The vote was on the amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 214 to 211. The House later passed the underlying legislation, but the final version that was signed into law did not include the policy. \[House Vote 227, [6/13/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll227.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/13/13](http://cq.com/vote/2013/H/227?0); Congressional Record, [6/13/13](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2013/06/13/CREC-2013-06-13-pt1-PgH3382-2.pdf); Congress.gov, [H.R. 1960](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1960/text); Public Law, [113-66](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ66/PLAW-113publ66.pdf); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3304](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3304/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.

### Indefinite Detention

**2013: Schweikert Voted Against Requiring That War On Terror Detainees Captured In U.S. Territory Be Tried In A Civilian Court.** In June 2013, Schweikert voted against an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act of FY2014 that would have, according to the House Committee on Rules, "eliminate\[d\] indefinite military detention of any person detained under \[the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force's (AUMF)\] authority in the United States, territories or possessions by providing immediate transfer to trial and proceedings by a court established under Article III of the Constitution or by an appropriate state court." The amendment would also have prohibited the transfer of such a person to military custody. The amendment failed by a vote of 200 to 226. \[House Vote 228, [6/13/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll228.xml); House Report 113-108, [6/13/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113hrpt108/pdf/CRPT-113hrpt108.pdf); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 152](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/152/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1960](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1960/all-actions)\]

-   **2011: Congress Affirmed Presidential Authority To Indefinitely Detain War On Terror Combatants.** In the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012, Congress affirmed that the President had the authority to detain anyone connected to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks or was part of or "substantially supported" Al Qaeda, Taliban or associated forces. Congress further affirmed that the president had the authority to, among other things, detain those captured under that authority indefinitely. \[Public Law 112-81, [12/31/11](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-112publ81/pdf/PLAW-112publ81.pdf#page=266)\]

-   **NY Times: Provision "Controversial" Because Vague, Silent On Application To U.S. Citizens Or Those Captured In U.S.** According to the New York Times, "Enactment of the statute was controversial, in part, because it did not lay out what conduct could lead to someone\'s being detained, and because it was silent about whether it extended to American citizens and others arrested on United States soil." \[New York Times, 6/7/12\]

### Military Detention

**2014: Schweikert Voted Against Prohibiting The U.S. Military From Holding Any Person Captured In The United States Indefinitely Under The 2001 Post-September 11 Authorization To Use Military Force (AUMF).** In May 2014, Schweikert voted against an amendment to the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would \[have\] prohibit\[ed\] the indefinite military detention of any person detained under the \[2001\] Authorization for Use of Military Force authority in the United States, its territories or possessions. It also would \[have\] str\[uc\]k\[\] language \[in the underlying bill\] that would provide for mandatory military custody of covered parties." According to the summary of the amendment in the House Rules Committee's report on the rule for the bill, the amendment would have effectuated its prohibition on indefinite military detention "by providing for immediate transfer to trial and proceedings by a court established under Article III of the U.S. Constitution or by an appropriate state court." The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 191 to 230. \[House Vote 234, [5/22/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll234.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/22/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/234); House Report 113-460, [5/21/14](https://beta.congress.gov/113/crpt/hrpt460/CRPT-113hrpt460.pdf#page=4); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 676](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/676); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4435](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4435/all-actions)\]

-   **FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Left To The Courts The Issue Of Military Detention Under The 2001 AUMF Of American Citizens Or Those In The Country Legally.** According to the Congressional Research Service, "Section 1021 \[of the FY 2012 NDAA\] does not expressly clarify whether U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens may be determined to be 'covered persons' \[who are eligible for military detention under the FY 2012 NDAA's reaffirmation of detention authority under the 2001 AUMF.\] The potential application of an earlier version of Section 1021 found in S. 1867 (in that bill numbered Section 1031) to U.S. citizens and other persons within the United States was the subject of significant floor debate. An amendment that would have expressly barred U.S. citizens from long-term military detention on account of enemy belligerent status was considered and rejected. Ultimately, an amendment was adopted that added the following proviso: 'Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing law or authority relating to the detention of United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United States, or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States.' This language, which remains in the final version of the act, along with a separate clause which provides that nothing in Section 1021 'is intended to limit or expand the authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force,' makes clear that the provision is not intended to either expand or limit the executive's existing authority to detain U.S. citizens and resident aliens, as well as other persons captured in the United States. Such detentions have been rare and subject to substantial controversy, without achieving definitive resolution in the courts. \[...\] Consequently, if the executive branch decides to hold such a person under the detention authority affirmed in Section 1021, it is left to the courts to decide whether Congress meant to authorize such detention when it enacted the AUMF in 2001" (footnotes omitted). \[CRS Report #42143, [6/23/14](http://www.cq.com/pdf/crsreports-4508437)\]

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Continue To Require That Certain Members Of Al Qaeda Or Its Allies -- Excluding U.S. Citizens -- Be Held By The U.S. Military Pending Transfer Or Trial.** In May 2014, Schweikert voted against an amendment to the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would \[have\] prohibit\[ed\] the indefinite military detention of any person detained under the \[2001\] Authorization for Use of Military Force authority in the United States, its territories or possessions. It also would \[have\] str\[uc\]k\[\] language \[in the underlying bill\] that would provide for mandatory military custody of covered parties." According to the summary of the amendment in the House Rules Committee's report on the rule for the bill, the amendment would have effectuated its prohibition on indefinite military detention "by providing for immediate transfer to trial and proceedings by a court established under Article III of the U.S. Constitution or by an appropriate state court." The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 191 to 230. \[House Vote 234, [5/22/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll234.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/22/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/234); House Report 113-460, [5/21/14](https://beta.congress.gov/113/crpt/hrpt460/CRPT-113hrpt460.pdf#page=4); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 676](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/676); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4435](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4435/all-actions)\]

-   **FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Provision Required That Certain Captured Members Of Al Qaeda And "Associated Forces" Be Held By The Military Until A Decision Is Made On Trying Them; Language Expressly Did Not Apply To U.S. Citizens.** According to the Congressional Research Service, "The provision \[in the FY 2012 NDAA\] that appears to have evoked the most resistance on the part of the Administration, Section 1022, generally requires at least temporary military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and members of certain 'associated forces' who are taken into the custody or brought under the control of the United States as of 60 days from the date of enactment. This provision does not apply to all persons who are permitted to be detained as 'covered persons' under Section 1021, but only those captured during the course of hostilities who meet certain criteria. It expressly excludes U.S. citizens from its purview, although it applies to lawful resident aliens (albeit with the caveat that if detention is based on conduct taking place within the United States, such detention is mandated only 'to the extent permitted by the Constitution of the United States'). Moreover, the President is authorized to waive the provision's application if he submits a certification to Congress that 'such a waiver is in the national security interests of the United States.' \[...\] Persons described above are required to be detained by military authorities pending "disposition under the law of war," as defined in Section 1021, except that additional requirements must first be met before the detainee can be transferred to another country. Accordingly, such persons may be (1) held in military detention until hostilities under the AUMF are terminated; (2) tried before a military commission; (3) transferred from military custody for trial by another court having jurisdiction; or (4) transferred to the custody of a foreign government or entity, provided the transfer requirements established in Section 1028 of the act, discussed infra, are satisfied" (footnotes omitted). \[CRS Report #42143, [6/23/14](http://www.cq.com/pdf/crsreports-4508437)\]

**2013: Schweikert Voted Against Repealing Requirement That War On Terror Detainees Who Are Not U.S. Citizens Be Held By The Military.** In June 2013, Schweikert voted against an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act of FY2014 that would have repealed a requirement enacted in 2011 that any alleged Al Qaeda, Taliban or supporting group members detained under the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force be held in military custody. The requirement did not apply to detainees who are U.S. citizens. The amendment failed by a vote of 200 to 226. \[House Vote 228, [6/13/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll228.xml); House Report 113-108, [6/13/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113hrpt108/pdf/CRPT-113hrpt108.pdf); Congressional Actions, [H.
