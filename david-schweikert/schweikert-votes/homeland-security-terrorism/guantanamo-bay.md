It would \[have\] elevate\[d\] U.S. Cyber Command to an independent major command within the Defense Department. It would \[have\] prohibit\[ed\] detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, from being transferred to U.S. soil, and would \[have\] prohibit\[ed\] the closing of the main base and detention facility at Guantanamo. It would \[have\] extend\[ed\], through 2017, the authority for several bonus and special payments for military members." The vote was on the conference report. The House adopted the legislation by a vote of 375 to 34. The Senate later passed the legislation and was signed into law by the president. \[House Vote 600, [12/2/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll600.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/2/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/600?65); Congressional Actions, [S. 2943](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2943/all-actions)\]

**2016: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Allowing The DoD To Survey, Asses Or Review Potential U.S. Locations To Transfer Guantanamo Bay Detainees To.** In June 2016, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] use of funds by the Defense Department to survey, assess or review potential locations in the United States to house Guantanamo Bay detainees." The underlying legislation was an FY 2017 defense appropriation. The vote was on the amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 245 to 175.

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Continuing To Prevent The Closure Of The Detention Facility At Guantanamo Bay And Restricts The Ability Of The President Transfer Detainees As Part Of The December 2015 Omnibus Appropriations Package.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted against continuing to prevent the closure of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and restricts the ability of the president transfer detainees as part of the December 2015 omnibus appropriations deal. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Like the defense and intelligence authorization bills, the measure continues to prevent the closure of the detention facility at the U.S. Naval Station, Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and continues restrictions on the president's ability to transfer detainees suspected of participating in acts of terrorism. It also continues to prohibit the use of any funds for the construction or modification of any facility in the United States to detain or imprison individuals currently being held at Guantánamo. It specifically prohibits the transfer or release of any Gitmo detainee to Libya, Somalia, Syria or Yemen." The legislation was, according to Congressional Quarterly, a FY 2016 Omnibus Appropriations bill. The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill with an amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 316 to 113. The legislation was later combined with a tax extender bill.

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment Allowing For The Closing Of Guantanamo Bay.** In June 2015, Schweikert voted against an amendment striking sections of the underlying legislation that would have prevented the Obama Administration from closing Guantanamo Bay. According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have "str\[uck\] four sections of the bill which add new restrictions to prevent the Obama Administration from closing the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp." The vote was on the amendment and the House rejected the motion 176 to 246. The underlying legislation was H.R. 2596, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. \[House Vote 367, [6/16/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll367.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/16/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/367?1); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2596](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2596/actions)\]

-   **Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA): Amendment Gives President Obama The Option To Close Guantanamo Bay, Which Damages The United States "Every Day That It Remains Open."** In a floor speech Rep. Schiff said, "Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike the sections of the bill which would undermine the administration's ability to close the prison at Guantanamo by transferring the remaining detainees to the United States for further disposition of their cases or to third countries that agree to accept them, secure them, and monitor them. I am grateful that my colleague from Washington, Adam Smith, ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, has joined me in urging the House to make this important change to the bill. Every day that it remains open, the prison at Guantanamo Bay damages the United States. Because there are other, better options for the prosecution and detention of these inmates, we are not safer for Guantanamo\'s existence. In fact, it makes us more vulnerable by drawing new recruits to the jihad." \[Congressional Record, [6/16/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4396-1)\]

-   **Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA): Closing Guantanamo Would Allowed Inmates To Be Tried In Civilian Courts In The United States.** In a floor speech Rep. Schiff said, "These provisions also prevent the administration from transferring Guantanamo detainees to the United States for further proceedings under the military commissions process or for trial in an article III court. The Department of Justice and our courts have proven themselves time and time again to be more than capable of handling the toughest terrorism cases and doing so in a way that ennobles us and sets an example to the world that a great nation can both safeguard its people and the rule of law. As a practical matter, our civilian courts have proven much more adept at handling these cases than the military commissions process has. In fact, this past Friday, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, one of the most important appellate courts in the Nation, further struck down the legality of commission charges, so narrowing the jurisdiction of the military commissions themselves that any utility as an alternative to article III courts has been called into further question." \[Congressional Record, [6/16/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4396-1)\]

-   **Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA): Guantanamo Bay A "Rallying Cry" For Jihadis.** In a floor speech Rep. Schiff said, "The recruitment of those additional fighters uses a variety of images and issues to attract people to join the jihad. One of the issues that is continually used as recruiting propaganda is the presence of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. This is a recruitment vehicle for the jihadis. It is a rallying cry for the jihadis. The closure of this prison will not end the threat from ISIS or al Qaeda. There will be other efforts to recruit. But why give them this recruitment tool when there are other, better ways that these people can be incarcerated?" \[Congressional Record, [6/16/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4396-1)\]

-   **Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA): Closing Guantanamo Bay Would Endanger National Security.** In a flood speech Rep. Nunes said, "Mr. Chairman, although I appreciate the ranking member's concerns about these provisions, I do remain concerned that further releases from Guantanamo will threaten our national security. Press reports now indicate that the administration intends to transfer up to 10 additional detainees this month. As the committee learned through its many briefings and hearings, the five detainees released to Qatar last May have participated in activities that threaten the United States and its allies and are counter to U.S. national security interests, not unlike their activities before they were detained. No intelligence community element should enable any future transfers that endanger national security." \[Congressional Record, [6/16/15](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4396-1)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Closing The Guantanamo Bay Facility By The End Of 2017 And Allow For Domestic Transfer.** In May 2015, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] a framework for closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, by Dec. 31, 2017. The amendment would \[have\] remove\[d\] restrictions in the bill against transferring Guantanamo Bay, Cuba detainees to the U.S., constructing or modifying any facility in the U.S. to house a Guantanamo Bay detainee, and transferring detainees to a combat zone." The underlying legislation was an FY 2016 defense authorization. The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 174 to 249. \[House Vote 231, [5/14/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll231.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/14/15](http://cq.com/vote/2015/H/231?2); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 221](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/221/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1735](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1735/all-actions)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted For A Bill That Would Lengthen To Two Years The Bill's Restrictions On The Transfer Of Detainees From Guantanamo Bay.** In May 2015, Schweikert voted for that would lengthen restrictions on transfers of detainees from Guantanamo Bay. According to Congressional Quarterly, HR 1735 "that would lengthen to two years the bill's restrictions on the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to the U.S. and on construction or modification of facilities in the U.S. to house Guantanamo detainees. It also would prohibit transfers of detainees to Yemen and bar the Defense secretary from using a national security waiver to transfer prisoners to combat zones." The underlying bill according to Congressional Quarterly, "reauthorizes 'appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes." The vote on the amendment was on passage and the House passed the amendment 243 to 180. The underlying legislation was later passed by both the House and Senate, but vetoed by President Obama and never overridden. \[House Vote 230, [5/14/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll230.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/14/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/230?33); Congressional Quarterly, [4/13/15](http://www.cq.com/bill/114/HR1735?34); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 220](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/220/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1735](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1735/all-actions)\]

-   **Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA): "Internationally, Guantanamo Continues To Be A Blight On The U.S. Record."** According to Congressional Record, "I oppose this amendment in large part because of the broader debate over closing Guantanamo, and this amendment makes it even more difficult to close Guantanamo, which is a policy we ought do. \[...\] We do not need Guantanamo. Beyond that, the amendment here makes it very, very difficult to transfer anybody, and a large number of inmates at Guantanamo have been cleared for transfer. They have been deemed not to be a threat, and they are cleared to be transferred. Mrs. Walorski's amendment would make it pretty much impossible to transfer them. These are people that we have already decided are not going to be a threat, and now, we are going to pass an amendment saying we are simply going to lock them up and hold them forever just because. \[...\] I will say that the statistics on people returning to the fight who have been in Guantanamo are very skewed. \[...\] Internationally, Guantanamo continues to be a blight on the U.S. record." \[Congressional Record, [5/14/15](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/220/text)\]

-   **Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-IN): "My Amendment Protects Our National Security, Further Strengthens And Extends Commonsense Restrictions On Guantanamo Transfers."** According to Congressional Record, Rep. Jackie Walorski said in a floor speech on the House floor, "It is safe to assume the administration is risking our national security for the sake of fulfilling a misguided campaign promise. Simply put, we have too much at stake to trust an executive order from the President. My amendment protects our national security, further strengthens and extends commonsense restrictions on Guantanamo transfers. It prohibits detainees from coming to the U.S., policy which has, in the past, had strong bipartisan support. In addition, it restricts the most dangerous detainees from being transferred. Finally, it bans transfers to Yemen, an al Qaeda stronghold, one of the most dangerous places on Earth to set terrorists free. When it comes to foreign policy and the security of the U.S., including the threat of Islamic extremism, President Obama doesn't seem to get it. It seems like the only thing we can trust the administration to do is underestimate the threat." \[Congressional Record, [5/14/15](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/220/text)\]

**2013: Schweikert Voted Against Legislation To Close The Detention Facility At Guantanamo Bay And To Permit Some Current Detainees To Be Held In The U.S.** In June 2013, Schweikert voted against an amendment to the 2014 Defense Authorization Act that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] for closure of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, by Dec. 31, 2014. It would \[have\] allow\[ed\] the use of funds in the \[underlying\] bill for the transfer or release of detainees at the Cuba facility and for construction or modification of a U.S. facility to house them. It would \[have\] prohibit\[ed\], after Dec. 31, 2014, the use of funds for the Cuba facility and require\[d\] the Defense secretary to designate a senior official to coordinate and manage its closure and the transfer of detainees." The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 174 to 249. \[House Vote 237, [6/14/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll237.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/14/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/floorvote-240077000); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 168](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/168/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1960](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1960/all-actions)\]

-   **As Of July 2013, Prison At Guantanamo Held 166 War On Terror Detainees, At An Estimated Cost Of \$150 Million Per Year.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The prison currently contains 166 detainees and hasn\'t accepted any new prisoners since March 2008. Of the current detainees, many of whom are conducting a hunger strike, 86 have been cleared to return to their home countries. However, inadequate safeguards in places such as Yemen, the unwillingness of countries to accept their own nationals and general congressional opposition have halted transfers out of the prison. It costs an estimated \$150 million a year to house the 166 detainees." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/11/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4292617/4)\]

-   **2009: President Obama Ordered Guantanamo Prison Be Shut Down Within A Year.** According to The New York Times, "President Obama signed executive orders Thursday directing the Central Intelligence Agency to shut what remains of its network of secret prisons and ordering the closing of the Guantánamo detention camp within a year, government officials said." \[New York Times, [1/21/13](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/us/politics/22gitmo.html?pagewanted=all)\]

-   **Congress Has Repeatedly Blocked Prison Closure By Prohibiting Transfer Of Prison's Detainees To The U.S., And, Often, Elsewhere.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The detention facility at the U.S. Naval Station, Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, was established in 2002 to detain prisoners captured in the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Both President George W. Bush --- toward the end of his second term --- and President Obama have stated their desire to close the facility. Congress, however, has repeatedly prevented the transfer of Guantánamo detainees either to the United States or, in many cases, to other countries." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/11/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4292617/4)\]

-   **The Underlying Bill Prohibited Any Foreign Release Of Guantanamo Bay Prisoners And Allowed New Construction At The Prison.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The \[unamended\] bill prohibits the use of Defense Department funds to release prisoners at the Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, detention center to a foreign country or entity. It also authorizes funds for the construction of new facilities at Guantánamo, even though the president has announced his intention to close the facility." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/11/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4292617)\]

-   **Supporters Of Closing Prison Argued It Was Unnecessary And Expensive, And Its Existence Undermined U.S. Anti-Terror Efforts.** According to the Congressional Record, Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA) said, "The bottom line is that we do not need Guantanamo. Guantanamo was set up in the first place in the hopes that, because it wasn't actually on American soil, we could somehow hold people outside the normal bounds of due process and the Constitution, but the \[Supreme\] Court ruled otherwise. The Court ruled that habeas does apply because Guantanamo is effectively under the control of the United States. So there is no benefit there. There are no greater rights in the U.S. than there are in Guantanamo. We just continue to have this prison that has been set up in a way that the international community cannot stand, and it makes a problem for us in terms of being able to cooperate with our allies and to have the ability to get that cooperation to properly prosecute the war on terror. \[...\] The prison is becoming very, very expensive. There is \$250 million in MilCon contained in this bill just to keep it at a somewhat temporary status. Beyond that, the prospect of the United States' simply warehousing 166 people forever with no end in sight is contrary, again, I think, to our values and to our process." \[Congressional Record, [6/14/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-06-14/pdf/CREC-2013-06-14-pt1-PgH3594-6.pdf#page=4)\]

-   **Senators McCain And Feinstein Joined Obama Chief Of Staff To Argue Closing Guantanamo Was "In Our National Interest."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "\[Senator John\] McCain \[R-AZ\] traveled to Guantánamo last week with Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Denis McDonough, White House chief of staff. They released a joint statement Friday night advocating the facility's closure. 'We continue to believe that it is in our national interest to end detention at Guantánamo, with a safe and orderly transition of the detainees to other locations,' they said. 'We intend to work, with a plan by Congress and the administration together, to take the steps necessary to make that happen.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/11/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4292617)\]

-   **Opponents Said Closure Required Expensive Transfer Of Dangerous Terrorists Into The U.S., Creating A Security Threat; Therefore, The Prison Should Be Kept Open Until The President Finds Another Way To Close It.** According to the Congressional Record, Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-OH) said, "\[T\]he Guantanamo Bay detention facility was established to hold unlawful enemy combatants captured during the war on terror. Any proposal to close the Guantanamo detention facility must first clearly address the transfer of remaining prisoners detained there. Many of the remaining detainees are the most hardened terrorists, including those responsible for the 9/11 mass murders of many Americans. \[...\] I believe the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay are being treated appropriately and in a way that we can be proud of as a Nation. The hunger strike policy is carried out humanely with the detainees treated as patients. The access to caregivers and medical facilities is the same for our troops as it is for those detained. Additionally, transfers to the United States would be very expensive. We've already built a courtroom there that cost us in the millions of dollars. These terrorist detainees pose a very real danger to our security in America. They mean us real harm. The President has the ability to certify transfers of detainees to other countries, but he has yet to do so. And until the President leads with a better solution, I firmly believe that keeping Guantanamo open is our best option, our safest option, and our most logical option." \[Congressional Record, [6/14/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-06-14/pdf/CREC-2013-06-14-pt1-PgH3594-6.pdf#page=5)\]

-   **Senator Inhofe: Closing Guantanamo "Lets Terrorists Win."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "On Saturday, \[Senator James\] Inhofe \[R-OK\] put out a no-holds-barred written statement of his own, stating that closing Guantánamo 'lets terrorists win.' He called the Guantánamo prisoners' ongoing hunger strike a 'political act designed to attempt to change American policy.' 'The far left has used this as a rallying cry to revive their continuing obsession with closing the base despite strong support from Congress to keep GITMO open,' he said." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/11/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4292617)\]

The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 defense authorization. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 167 to 257. \[House Vote 359, [7/13/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll359.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/13/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/359?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

Simply put, we have too much at stake to trust an executive order from the President. My amendment protects our national security, further strengthens and extends commonsense restrictions on Guantanamo transfers. It prohibits detainees from coming to the U.S., policy which has, in the past, had strong bipartisan support. In addition, it restricts the most dangerous detainees from being transferred. Finally, it bans transfers to Yemen, an al Qaeda stronghold, one of the most dangerous places on Earth to set terrorists free. When it comes to foreign policy and the security of the U.S., including the threat of Islamic extremism, President Obama doesn't seem to get it.

Those facilities are currently operating at only 48 percent capacity. \[...\] President Obama has asked the Congress to lift restrictions on detainee transfers. He's asked DOD to identify a site in the United States for military commissions. They will appoint a senior envoy charged with transferring detainees to third countries and he's got to lift the restriction on transfers to Yemen. He's going to staff the periodic review board for those that cannot be transferred. I think he should use the certification and waiver provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act to transfer detainees from Guantanamo beginning with the reported 86 detainees already cleared for transfer. But he can't do what he needs to do for our national security as long as the language of section 413 is in this bill. That's why my amendment would remove this restriction. What we're doing does not comport with America's system of justice or with fairness. And as I say, I believe it's a direct threat to our national security. So, Mr. Chairman, I would urge that we remove this language by voting for my amendment. We have Department of Defense facilities, they're being underused in the United States, and that's the way that we could clear up a situation that we never should have created in the first place." \[Congressional Record, [6/4/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-06-04/pdf/CREC-2013-06-04-pt1-PgH3044-3.pdf#page=29)\]

Secondly, Director Mueller, and I don't have the letter here, but I will give it to my friend, said this could have an impact on local jails, the locality of the jails. Do you remember the Blind Sheikh Rahman when Officer Pepe was stabbed in the eye with regard to an escape? To bring people like this into the United States could have an impact not only on the jail but also on the community. To bring Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to the United States would cost roughly, if you recall, \$250 million a year. Moussaoui, who was tried in the gentleman's district in Alexandria, it literally upset Alexandria, and if you take the same timeframe that Moussaoui was tried in, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's trial would go on for 4 years, would cost \$1 billion\--\$250 million a year. \[...\] Lastly, the Bureau of Prisons, we had to give Holder the ability to reprogram money because they were going to furlough prison guards. They were going to furlough prison guards. So to bring people like this in to put this stress on the Bureau of Prisons would be absolutely crazy. \[...\] The gentleman is a good friend, but it's a bad amendment, and it's a very dangerous amendment and it would cost a lot of money and, quite frankly, I think would endanger the locality." \[Congressional Record, [6/4/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-06-04/pdf/CREC-2013-06-04-pt1-PgH3044-3.pdf#page=29)\]

According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have, "\[struck\] section 8102 of the \[FY 2016 Defense Appropriations bill\], which bar\[red\] funds from being used to transfer any individual detained at U.S. Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to the custody or control of the individual\'s home country or any other foreign country except in accordance with the fiscal 2014 defense authorization act." The underlying measure was the FY 2016 Defense Appropriations bill. The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment 181 to 251. \[House Vote 338, [6/10/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll338.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/10/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/338?1); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Statement Of Administration Policy: Opposed Section 8102 Because It Limited Its Ability To Manage The Detainee Population At Guantanamo Bay.** According to the Office of Management and Budget, "The Administration strongly objects to sections 8100, 8101, and 8102 of the bill, which would restrict the Executive Branch\'s ability to manage the detainee population at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba detention facility. Sections 8100 and 8101 would prohibit the use of funds for the transfer of detainees to the United States and for the construction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house Guantanamo detainees in the United States." \[Statement Of Administration Policy, [6/9/15](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/114/saphr2685r_20150609.pdf)\]

-   **John McCain Said The Restrictions On Guantanamo Bay Detainee Transfers Existed Because The President "Never Came Forward With A Plan."** According to the Daily Caller, "'There is still no plan on what to do and how to do it with the detainees at Guantánamo Bay,' said McCain. 'If the administration complains about the provisions concerning Guantánamo, then it's their fault because they never came forward with a plan.' Despite the facility's closure being an administration priority as of late, no plan was sent to Congress. The Pentagon is currently scouting out potentially suitable locations for prisoners to be shipped in the United States. \[...\]Both Democrats on the House and Senate defense committees refused to sign the conference report. Democratic Rep. Adam Smith highlighted Gitmo as one of the reasons for holding back his signature." \[Daily Caller, [9/30/15](http://dailycaller.com/2015/09/30/mccain-blames-obama-administration-for-not-submitting-gitmo-closure-plan-in-time/)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted For A Bill That Would Lengthen To Two Years The Bill's Restrictions On The Transfer Of Detainees From Guantanamo Bay.** In May 2015, Schweikert voted for that would lengthen restrictions on transfers of detainees from Guantanamo Bay. According to Congressional Quarterly, HR 1735 "that would lengthen to two years the bill's restrictions on the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to the U.S. and on construction or modification of facilities in the U.S. to house Guantanamo detainees. It also would prohibit transfers of detainees to Yemen and bar the Defense secretary from using a national security waiver to transfer prisoners to combat zones." The underlying bill according to Congressional Quarterly, "reauthorizes 'appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes." The vote on the amendment was on passage and the House passed the amendment 243 to 180. The underlying legislation was later passed by both the House and Senate, but vetoed by President Obama and never overridden. \[House Vote 230, [5/14/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll230.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/14/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/230?33); Congressional Quarterly, [4/13/15](http://www.cq.com/bill/114/HR1735?34); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA): "Internationally, Guantanamo Continues To Be A Blight On The U.S. Record."** According to Congressional Record, "I oppose this amendment in large part because of the broader debate over closing Guantanamo, and this amendment makes it even more difficult to close Guantanamo, which is a policy we ought do. \[...\] We do not need Guantanamo. Beyond that, the amendment here makes it very, very difficult to transfer anybody, and a large number of inmates at Guantanamo have been cleared for transfer. They have been deemed not to be a threat, and they are cleared to be transferred. Mrs. Walorski's amendment would make it pretty much impossible to transfer them. These are people that we have already decided are not going to be a threat, and now, we are going to pass an amendment saying we are simply going to lock them up and hold them forever just because. \[...\] I will say that the statistics on people returning to the fight who have been in Guantanamo are very skewed. \[...\] Internationally, Guantanamo continues to be a blight on the U.S. record." \[Congressional Record, [5/14/15](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/220/text)\]

-   **Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-IN): "My Amendment Protects Our National Security, Further Strengthens And Extends Commonsense Restrictions On Guantanamo Transfers."** According to Congressional Record, Rep. Jackie Walorski said in a floor speech on the House floor, "It is safe to assume the administration is risking our national security for the sake of fulfilling a misguided campaign promise. Simply put, we have too much at stake to trust an executive order from the President. My amendment protects our national security, further strengthens and extends commonsense restrictions on Guantanamo transfers. It prohibits detainees from coming to the U.S., policy which has, in the past, had strong bipartisan support. In addition, it restricts the most dangerous detainees from being transferred. Finally, it bans transfers to Yemen, an al Qaeda stronghold, one of the most dangerous places on Earth to set terrorists free. When it comes to foreign policy and the security of the U.S., including the threat of Islamic extremism, President Obama doesn't seem to get it. It seems like the only thing we can trust the administration to do is underestimate the threat." \[Congressional Record, [5/14/15](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/220/text)\]

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Bar The Release Or Transfer Of Guantanamo Bay Detainees To Any Foreign Country.** In June 2014, Schweikert voted for an amendment to the FY 2015 Defense Appropriations bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would bar the use of funds in the bill to release or transfer detainees from Guantanamo Bay to their country of origin or to any other foreign country." The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 230 to 184, and later passed the amended bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee has reported its own version of the legislation, but the full Senate has not yet considered it. \[House Vote 323, [6/19/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll323.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/19/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/323); Congressional Actions, [H.

The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 236 to 188, and the House subsequently passed the amended bill. A final version of a related bill did not include the provision. \[House Vote 236, [6/14/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll236.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/14/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/floorvote-240076000); Congressional Record, [12/12/13](http://beta.congress.gov/crec/2013/12/12/CREC-2013-12-12-pt1-PgH7894.pdf); Congress.gov, [H.R. 3304](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3304/); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3304](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3304/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Transferring Detainees To Yemen Important Element In Plans To Close Guantanamo Prison.** According to the Hill, "Transferring detainees to Yemen is a key part of ramping down the prison camp in Cuba, as 56 of the 86 detainees who have been cleared for release are from Yemen. Obama had issued a moratorium on transferring detainees to Yemen in January 2010 after the U.S. learned that 2009 'underwear bomber' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab had obtained instructions from terrorists in Yemen. But last month Obama said he would lift the restriction to jumpstart the transfer of cleared detainees." \[The Hill, [6/14/13](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/305607-house-blocks-guantanamo-detainee-transfers-to-yemen)\]

-   **The Yemen Restriction Joined Several Provisions Already In The Bill That Would Continue To Block The President From Closing Guantanamo.** According to the Hill, "The Yemen restriction was the latest attempt in Congress to prevent the president from closing Guantánamo. The defense authorization bill included restrictions on moving detainees to U.S. soil or to build facilities in the U.S. for detainees, restrictions that have also been in prior authorization bills. Those limitations will make it all but impossible for the president to close the prison, although he does still have the ability to transfer out cleared detainees if they have a country to go to." \[The Hill, [6/14/13](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/305607-house-blocks-guantanamo-detainee-transfers-to-yemen)\]

-   **Amendment's Sponsor Said U.S. Should Not Be Sending Detainees To Terrorist Hotbed.** According to the Hill, "Walorski said that the U.S. should not send potential detainees to Yemen, because Yemen has been a hotbed for terrorist activity as the home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). 'It makes no sense to send terrorists to a country that has an active terrorist network,' Walorski said." \[The Hill, [6/14/13](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/305607-house-blocks-guantanamo-detainee-transfers-to-yemen)\]

He called the Guantánamo prisoners' ongoing hunger strike a 'political act designed to attempt to change American policy.' 'The far left has used this as a rallying cry to revive their continuing obsession with closing the base despite strong support from congress to keep GITMO open,' he said." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/11/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4292617)\]

They said that Congress should not tie the president's hands when the Pentagon already certifies that releasing detainees to another country is not a risk to national security. 'We cannot warehouse these people forever,' said Rep. Adam Smith (Wash.), the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. 'We need to give the president options, not restrict him.'" \[The Hill, [6/14/13](http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/305607-house-blocks-guantanamo-detainee-transfers-to-yemen)\]
