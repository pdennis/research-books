### Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act of 2016

**2016: Schweikert Voted For The Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act of 2016 Which Criminalized Knowingly Defrauding A Veteran Of Their Benefits.** In April 2016, Schweikert voted for a bill that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "establish\[ed\] a penalty of a fine, imprisonment for a maximum five years, or both, for knowingly engaging in a 'scheme or artifice' to defraud an individual of their veterans benefits, or in connection with obtaining veterans benefits for that person." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 411 to 0. The bill died in the Senate. \[House Vote 140, [4/12/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll140.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/12/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/140?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4676](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4676/all-actions)\]
