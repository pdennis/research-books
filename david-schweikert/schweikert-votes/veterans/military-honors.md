### Stolen Valor Act

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Create Criminal Penalties On Individuals Who Falsely Represent Themselves As Beneficiaries Of A Military Honor For Monetary Gain.** In May 2013, Schweikert voted for the Stolen Valor Act of 2013. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "establish\[ed\] penalties, including up to one year in prison or fines, on individuals who fraudulently represent themselves as recipients of a military decoration or medal with the intent to obtain money, property or anything of value." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 390 to 3. The Senate later passed the bill by unanimous consent, and it was signed into law by the president. \[House Vote 161, [5/20/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll161.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/20/13](http://cq.com/vote/2013/H/161?2); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 258](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/258/all-actions)\]
