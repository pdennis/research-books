# Military Personnel Records

### Veterans' Record Request Backlog

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Authorize \$60 Million For The National Archives And Records Administration To Address Backlogs On Military Personnel Record Requests From Veterans, Improve Digital Preservation And Access To Archives, And Address FOIA Backlogs.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for a resolution, which would "authorize \$60 million for the National Archives and Records Administration to address backlogs in responding to military personnel record requests from veterans, improve cybersecurity, improve digital preservation and access to archival federal records and address backlogs in Freedom of Information Act requests. It would require the U.S. archivist to submit to Congress, within 60 days of enactment, a plan to reduce the backlog of requests from the National Personnel Records Center and improve operations efficiency, including an estimate of backlog record requests for veterans; target timeframes to reduce the backlog; and strategies to prevent future backlogs. It would also require the archivist to ensure that the center maintains staffing levels and telework arrangements that enable the 'maximum processing' of records requests with the goal of responding to 90 percent of requests in 20 days or less." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote 406-21, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 356, [7/14/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll356.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/14/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/356?27); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7337](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7337/all-actions?overview=closed#tabs)\]
