**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Creating A Pilot Program Establishing A Graduated Commercial Driver's License For Those Between The Ages Of 18 And 21 For Veterans And Reserve Members As Part Of A Five Year Surface Transportation Reauthorization.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted against creating a commercial driver's license pilot program for veterans as part of a five year surface transportation reauthorization. According to Congressional Quarterly, the conference report "The agreement establishes a graduated commercial driver\'s license pilot program under which drivers between the ages of 18 and 21 could operate a commercial motor vehicle in a limited capacity in interstate commerce. Under the measure, only veterans and reserve members who received training during their service in the military to operate a commercial motor vehicle or similar vehicle would be eligible. The young drivers would not be permitted to operate commercial vehicles in special configurations, or to transport passengers or hazardous cargo." The underlying legislation would have "reauthorize\[d\] federal-aid highway and transit programs for five years, through fiscal 2020, at increased levels." The vote was on the conference report. The House approved the legislation by a vote of 359 to 65. The Senate later passed the legislation and the president later signed the legislation. \[House Vote 673, [12/3/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll673.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/3/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/S/331?0); Congressional Quarterly, [12/3/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4799720?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 22](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/22/all-actions)\]
