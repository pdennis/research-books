### Excluding Veterans And Servicemembers From A Provision That Would Ease The Standards For What Constitutes A Qualified Mortgage

**2015: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Protecting Veterans And Members Of The Armed Forces From A Bill That Would Weaken The Standards For What Constitutes A Qualified Mortgage.** In November 2015, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment, according to Congressional Quarterly, "exclude\[d\] consumers that are veterans or members of the armed forces from those provided for under provisions of the bill, specifically those provisions that would prohibit lawsuits against creditors that are depository institutes and fail to comply with certain requirements of a home mortgage loan." The underlying bill would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "ease\[d\] standards for qualified mortgages established by the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law (PL 111-203). It would \[have\[ allow\[ed\] more mortgages to meet the qualified mortgage threshold --- a standard that protects lenders from litigation if the buyer defaults --- provided a bank or financial firm retains the mortgage in its portfolio." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 184 to 242. \[House Vote 635, [11/18/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll635.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/18/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/635?15); Congressional Quarterly, [11/18/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4792815?16); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1210](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1210/all-actions)\]

-   **Statement Of Administration Policy: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Qualified Mortgage Rule "Requires A Lender To Make A Good Faith Effort" To Determine A Borrower's Ability To Repay "And That The Loan Does Not" Have "Excessive Upfront Points And Fees."** According to a Statement of Administration Policy, "Among other protections, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Qualified Mortgage (QM) rule requires a lender to make a good faith effort to determine that a borrower has the ability to repay a mortgage, and that the loan does not include excessive upfront points and fees. The final rule also contains special provisions and exemptions that are available only to small lenders or to small lenders that operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas." \[Statement of Administration Policy, [11/17/15](http://www.cq.com/pdf/4791816.pdf)\]

### Homeless Veterans

**2013: Schweikert Voted to Require Federal Agencies Report Annually Their Efforts To Reduce Veteran Homelessness.** In May 2013, Schweikert voted for legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "establish\[ed\] a special assistant for veterans affairs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and require agencies to report annually to Congress on efforts to reduce veteran homelessness." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 420 to 3. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 149, [5/15/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll149.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/15/13](http://cq.com/vote/2013/H/149?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 384](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/384/all-actions)\]
