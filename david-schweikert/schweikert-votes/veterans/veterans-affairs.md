This amount also includes \$2 billion for infrastructure improvements at VA facilities and state veterans' homes." \[House Appropriations Committee Democrats, [Accessed 4/4/18](https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/sites/democrats.appropriations.house.gov/files/wysiwyg_uploaded/Top%2010%20Democratic%20Priorities%20in%20Omnibus_0.pdf)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted Against A Continuing Resolution Funding The Government Through December 9, 2016 That Also Funded Veterans Health Care For The Entire Fiscal Year, But Did Not Include Aid For Flint, Michigan.** In September 2016, Schweikert voted against a ten week continuing resolution. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Congress could pass one of its 12 annual appropriations bills this week, if the fiscal 2017 Military Construction-VA conference report stays intact inside the stopgap spending bill. \[...\] If approved, the bill would fund veterans' health care programs and military construction projects throughout the next fiscal year and doesn't appear to be one of the remaining conflicts to reaching a bipartisan deal to fund the government through Sept. 30." In addition, according to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation was a "continuing resolution \[...\] that keeps the government running through Dec. 9." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment. The House agreed to the motion, effectively passing the bill by a vote of 342 to 85. The Senate had already passed the legislation. The president then signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 573, [9/28/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll573.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/23/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4963616?21); Congressional Quarterly, [9/26/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4963554?8); Congressional Quarterly, [9/22/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4962089?22); Congressional Actions, [S.

-   **Democrats Objected To The CR Because It Did Not Include Aid For Flint, Michigan.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Democrats and Republicans appear to be locked in a staring contest over the lack of government assistance for Flint, Mich., in a stopgap spending bill, with aides on both sides suggesting they're waiting for the other side to blink. Democrats roundly criticized a GOP written continuing resolution filed Thursday by Senate Republicans, but the measure actually met many of the spending and policy demands Democrats had made throughout weeks of negotiations --- except for a Flint response. Their central objection to the stopgap is the inclusion of flood relief for Louisiana and likely other states without also providing aid for Flint to address major problems caused by lead contamination in the city water supply." \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/26/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4963653?26)\]

-   **Legislation Was Originally Blocked, Primarily By Senate Democrats Due, To Flint Aid Omission; Deal With Minority Leader Pelosi And Speaker Ryan Over Flint Aid In A Water Bill Sealed The CR's Passage.** According to the Washington Post, "The Senate cemented an agreement Wednesday to avoid an Oct. 1 government shutdown after House Republicans allowed a vote on federal aid to address the water crisis in Flint, Mich., removing a major obstacle in negotiations. \[...\] Democrats made clear earlier this week they would not support the spending bill unless Republicans moved to guarantee Flint aid, while GOP leaders countered the Senate had approved Flint aid earlier this month in a separate water projects bill. The impasse was broken late Tuesday after House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) struck a deal allowing a vote to attach \$170 million in Flint relief to the House version of the water bill. That bill is expected to pass late Wednesday; the stopgap spending measure is expected to pass shortly afterward." \[Washington Post, [9/28/16](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/09/28/house-leaders-reach-deal-on-flint-aid-potentially-averting-shutdown/)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Funding Veterans Programs For FY 2016 As Part Of The FY 2016 Omnibus.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted against funding federal veterans programs. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "provide\[d\] for a total of \$162.7 billion for all veterans programs (net discretionary and mandatory) in FY 2016 --- \$3.5 billion (2%) more than the FY 2015 level but \$2 billion (1%) less than requested. \[...\] Of the total provided for veterans for FY 2016, a net \$71.4 billion (44%) is for discretionary spending, primarily veterans health programs, and \$91.3 billion (56%) is for mandatory programs, primarily veterans compensation and pensions. The measure provides \$1.3 billion more than requested in discretionary funding but \$3.3 billion less than requested in mandatory funding. The measure also provides \$63.3 billion in discretionary advance appropriations for FY 2017 for VA's medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities accounts, as well as \$102.5 billion in mandatory advance appropriations for FY 2017 for veterans benefits." The legislation was, according to Congressional Quarterly, a FY 2016 Omnibus Appropriations bill. The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill with an amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 316 to 113. The legislation was later combined with a tax extender bill. The Senate passed the larger measure and the president signed it. \[House Vote 705, [12/18/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll705.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/18/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/S/339?20); Congressional Quarterly, [12/15/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/705?20); Congressional Quarterly, [12/17/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4809119?25); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2029](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029/all-actions)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2016 Military Construction And VA Appropriations Bill Which Contained Over \$500 Million In Funds In Un-Capped Spending.** In April 2015, Schweikert voted for the FY 2016 military construction and VA appropriations bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "provide\[d\] \$171.1 billion in fiscal 2016 for the Veterans Affairs department, military construction and military housing. It would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$76.6 billion in discretionary spending, including \$60.2 billion for veterans' health programs. The bill would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$94.5 billion in mandatory spending for veterans' service-connected compensation, benefits and pensions. The total also include\[d\] \$7.7 billion for military construction, including \$1.4 billion for military family housing. The bill would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$167.3 billion in advance appropriations for certain VA medical care accounts for fiscal 2017." The vote was on the legislation. The House passed the legislation by a vote of 255 to 163. The Congress later passed an Omnibus spending measure in December. \[House Vote 193, [4/30/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll193.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/30/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/193?28); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2029](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029/all-actions)\]

-   **Democrats Were Opposed To The Legislation In Part Due To \$532 Million In Un-Capped Overseas Contingency Operations.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "House lawmakers on Thursday passed the amended Military Construction-VA spending bill (HR 2029) 255-163 after rejecting three amendments that would have collectively struck the \$532 million in military construction-related funding the measure allocates using the un-capped Overseas Contingency Operations account. Nearly 160 Democrats voted against the measure, a notable departure from recent years, when the typically bipartisan measure has garnered more than 400 votes on the House floor. \[...\] The three OCO amendments each garnered more than two dozen Republican votes in support, mostly from fiscal conservatives who view the extra war money as wasteful and an end-run around spending caps. Nearly all Democrats voted in favor, since they wanted to stymie Republicans\' efforts to move spending bills at sequestration levels. But GOP leaders were able to corral enough votes from hawkish lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to ensure the provisions were defeated." \[Congressional Quarterly, [4/30/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4674223?33&search=PsucqDn8)\]

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Provide \$136 Billion To Fund All Veterans' Programs Through FY 2013, As Well As \$54.5 Billion In Advance FY 2014 Funding For Certain VA Medical Services-Related Areas.** In March 2013, Schweikert voted for the House's version of the FY 2013 Military Construction and Veterans Appropriations Bill, which was bundled with a defense appropriations bill for FY2013, and a continuing resolution funding the rest of the government through the end of FY 2013 at FY 2012 levels. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill provides for a total of \$135.8 billion for all veterans programs (discretionary and mandatory) in FY 2013. \[...\] In addition, the measure provides the requested \$54.5 billion in advance appropriations for FY 2014 for VA\'s medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities accounts. \[...\] Of the total provided for veterans in FY 2013, \$62.9 billion (46%) is for discretionary spending, primarily veterans\' health programs, and \$72.9 billion (54%) is for mandatory programs, primarily veterans\' compensation and pensions. Both are essentially equal to the president\'s request. None of the funding provided in this bill for Veterans Affairs is subject to sequestration." The House passed the bill by a vote of 267 to 151. Following House passage, the Senate passed a substitute version of the bill, which the House then approved and the president signed into law. \[House Vote 62, [3/6/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll062.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/6/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4231829); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 933](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/933/all-actions)\]

-   **2009: Congress Decided To Fund Certain VA Medical Accounts One Fiscal Year In Advance, In Order To Address The Uncertainty Created By Its Repeated Failure To Fund VA Health Care By The Start Of A New Fiscal Year.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House voted Thursday \[October 8, 2009\] to put politically sensitive veterans' health care programs on a two-year budget cycle. \[...\] The bill would authorize appropriations for the VA medical care programs one year in advance of the start of each fiscal year. \[...\] \[T\]he version approved by the House would provide advance appropriations authority starting in fiscal 2011 for three Veterans Health Administration medical care accounts: medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities. Advocates say the change, which is supported by President Obama, would create more fiscal predictability for the medical accounts handled by the VA. \[...\] Supporters of the change say that for years the agency's health care system has been plagued by consistently late and, at times, inadequate budgets. Final appropriations for the VA have not been enacted before the start of the fiscal year in 19 of the past 22 years. The trend has continued into the current fiscal year \[FY 2010\], which began Oct. 1 \[2009\]. Additionally, requests for supplemental appropriations for VA health care have increased in frequency." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/8/09](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-3219832)\]

-   **FY 2013 Funding Was \$11.7 Billion More Than FY 2012, But Was \$1.7 Billion Less Than Requested.** According to Congressional Quarterly, the \$135.8 billion in FY 2013 funding was "\$11.7 billion (9%) more than the FY 2012 level but \$1.7 billion (1%) less than the president\'s request." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/6/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4231829)\]

-   **FY 2013 Funding Total Included \$52.5 Billion That Had Been Already Been Provided By The Previous Year's VA Funding Bill.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Of amounts available to the VA for FY 2013, \$52.5 billion represents advance appropriations for FY 2013 provided by the FY 2012 Military Construction-VA appropriations law (PL 112-74)." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/6/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4231829)\]

### Medical Facility Leases

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Providing Funding For Medical Facility Leases, Including \$922 Million For Enhanced-Use Leases In FY 2022, And \$1.9 Billion For FY 2023 And Over \$3.6 Billion For FY 2024 Through 2031 For Major Medical Facility Leases.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, which would "modify certain VA leasing authorities and appropriate funding for VA medical facility leases, including \$922 million for fiscal 2022 for enhanced-use leases, and \$1.9 billion for fiscal 2023 and over \$3.6 billion for fiscal years 2024 through 2031 for major medical facility leases." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote 342-88, thus the bill was sent to President Biden and became law. \[House Vote 309, [7/13/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll309.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/13/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/309?12); Congressional Actions, [S. 3373](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3373/actions)\]

### Mission Statement

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Prohibit The Removal Of The Department Of Veterans Affairs' Mission Statement From Signage.** In June 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "amendment no. 42 that would prohibit the use of funds provided by the bill to modify or remove any display of the VA that bears the mission statement 'To fulfill President Lincoln\'s promise \'to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan\' by serving and honoring the men and women who are America\'s veterans.'" The vote was on the amendment. The underlying legislation was the FY 2025 Military Construction-VA Appropriations. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 206 to 200. \[House Vote 241, [6/4/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll241.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/4/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/241?11); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt.954](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/954/actions?s=a&r=28); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8580](http://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8580/all-actions)\]

-   **The Mission Statement Had Recently Been Amended To Be More Inclusive Of Women Who Served.** According to the Military Times, "Veterans Affairs leaders are changing the department's mission statement from the current male-only focus to be more welcoming to women veterans, officials announced Thursday. The current motto --- in use by VA and the Veterans Administration since 1959 --- is based on an excerpt from President Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address: 'To fulfill President Lincoln's promise 'to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan' by serving and honoring the men and women who are America's veterans.' It's displayed prominently at about half of all VA hospitals, cemeteries and office buildings across the country. The new motto will still be based on Lincoln's words but instead reads: 'To fulfill President Lincoln's promise to care for those who have served in our nation's military and for their families, caregivers, and survivors.'" \[Military Times, [3/16/23](https://www.militarytimes.com/veterans/2023/03/16/va-to-change-its-motto-droppin-male-only-language/)\]

The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 221 to 212. \[House Vote 376, [7/26/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll376.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/26/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/376?31); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4366](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4366/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 301](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/301/actions?s=a&r=3)\]

-   **The Amendment Would Prevent The VA From Changing Their Mission Statement.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Among the newest of the 100-plus amendments submitted to the House Rules Committee, which is meeting Tuesday afternoon, is one from Freedom Caucus and Rules member Chip Roy, R-Texas, that would prevent the VA from changing its mission statement, which is displayed at around half the agencies' facilities. Roy's amendment would preserve the current statement, which is this: 'To fulfill President Lincoln\'s promise \'to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan\' by serving and honoring the men and women who are America\'s veterans.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/25/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7802761?44)\]

-   **March 2023: The VA Announced They Were Changing Their Mission Statement To Be More Inclusive.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The new mission statement, which the VA announced in March --- arguing it would be more inclusive --- is this: "To fulfill President Lincoln's promise to care for those who have served in our nation's military and for their families, caregivers, and survivors." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/25/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7802761?44)\]

The vote was on the adoption of an amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 204 to 227. \[House Vote 372, [7/26/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll372.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/26/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/372?27); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4366](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4366/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 296](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/296/actions?s=a&r=7)\]

### VA Scandal

**2014: Schweikert Voted For Legislation Expanding Veteran's Access To Health Care, Reforming Veterans Affairs (VA) Personnel Policies And Expanding VA Medical Staff.** In July 2014, Schweikert voted for legislation expanding veterans' access to health care, reforming the personnel policy of the VA and expanding VA medical staff. According to Congressional Quarterly, "the agreement increases veterans' access to health care in the wake of the Veterans Affairs (VA) Department scandal involving falsified appointment records that hid long wait times, allowing veterans to obtain health care at non-VA facilities if they live more than 40 miles from a VA clinic or can\'t get an appointment at a VA clinic within 30 days, and it increases the VA\'s capacity to provide services by providing expedited authority to hire more doctors and nurses \[,\] \[...\] authorizing leases for the opening of 27 new VA health facilities \[and\] \[...\] authorizes the VA secretary to fire or demote VA Senior Executive Service employees based on their performance or misconduct, providing for a limited appeals process during which the employee would not be paid." The House passed the conference agreement by a vote of 420 to 5; the conference agreement was later agreed to by the Senate and was signed into law by the president. \[House Vote 467, [7/30/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll467.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/31/14](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4526782/1?51&search=PGKZFIdR); Congressional Quarterly, [Accessed 9/28/15](http://www.cq.com/bill/113/HR3230?45); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3230](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3230/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Came After Revelations Of Falsified Wait-Time Records For Medical Appointments By The Department of Veterans Affairs, Reports That 57,000 Veterans Waited More Than 90 Days For A Medical Appointments And The Resignation Of Then VA Secretary Shinseki.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "After revelations this spring that some employees of the Veterans Affairs (VA) Department were falsifying wait-time records for veterans' medical appointments and keeping many patients on unofficial waitlists to create the appearance that they were reaching wait time targets, there was nearly universal support in Congress for overhauling the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and for making the VA more accountable. Former VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned in late May, shortly after the VA's inspector general reported that as many as 1,700 veterans at the Phoenix VA health facility were waiting for appointments outside of the clinic\'s official waiting list (with many waiting an average of 115 days for their first primary-care appointment). Moreover, the IG report noted that 'inappropriate scheduling practices are a systemic problem nationwide.' On June 9, the VA, under acting Secretary Sloan D. Gibson, released a review that found that 57,000 veterans nationwide waited more than 90 days for an appointment, while 64,000 others requested medical care but never made it onto a VA waiting list. The review also found that large numbers of VA schedulers were told by their superiors to falsify appointment requests and that such fraud was found at most VA health facilities." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/31/14](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4526782/1?51&search=PGKZFIdR)\]

-   **Earlier in 2014, The Senate And The House Has Passed Differing Versions Of The Same Bill, Costs Became A Concern.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House over the past few months passed a number of bills intended to increase accountability at the VA and provide greater access to health services for veterans, while the Senate passed a single, comprehensive measure to address the VA's issues. \[...\] During conference deliberations, the potential costs of both the House and Senate versions to provide greater access to non-VA health care services became the major focus and a cause of concern. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) initially estimated that those provisions in the Senate version would cost \$35 billion through FY 2019 and the House version \$44 billion and that, under both measures, veterans could ultimately seek additional care costing the government at least \$50 billion a year if the temporary access to non-VA care was allowed to continue. CBO later reduced those potential costs somewhat, but they still remained very high. \[...\] Republicans also expressed reservations that the costs of the Senate bill were classified as emergency spending that is exempt from budget caps, compared with the House version, where costs would be subject to the availability of appropriations." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/31/14](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4526782/1?51&search=PGKZFIdR)\]
