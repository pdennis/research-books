### Emergency Flexibility And Protections

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Provide Flexibility And Protections For Veteran Educational And Vocational Rehabilitation And Training Benefits If Such Benefits Were Negatively Impacted By A Declared Emergency, Such As 4 Additional Weeks Educational Assistance Or Work-Study Or Maintaining Benefit Eligibility If Veterans Withdrew From Programs Due To The Emergency.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted to concur with the Senate amendment to the Veterans Auto and Education Improvement Act of 2022, which would "provide certain flexibilities and protections for recipients of Veterans Affairs Department educational and vocational rehabilitation and training benefits whose studies or training are negatively affected by an emergency situation declared by the president or the VA. Among other provisions, it would allow the VA to provide four additional weeks of educational or work-study assistance to individuals whose educational programs are truncated, delayed, relocated, canceled or converted to distance learning due to an emergency. It would specify that individuals who withdraw from an educational program for reasons related to an emergency --- such as illness, childcare needs or financial hardship\--would still be eligible to receive benefits related to the program. It would specify that time during an emergency would not count toward time limitations on when veterans may use their educational benefits if the emergency prevents them from pursuing their chosen program. The bill would also make disabled veterans eligible for vehicle or other transportation assistance if more than 30 years have elapsed since they last received such assistance or, in cases 10 years after the bill's enactment, if more than 10 years have elapsed since they last received such assistance. The bill would make several other changes to VA educational and vocational training programs, including to clarify benefit eligibility for individuals who receive a sole survivorship discharge; outline processes for VA approval of study-abroad courses; require the use of standardized applications for course approval; and require the VA to provide not more than one business day of notice before a targeted compliance survey of an educational program. It would also allow servicemembers to terminate utilities contracts and provide for the transfer of professional licenses of servicemembers and their spouses if they are ordered to relocate. As an offset, it would extend the limitation on pensions paid to veterans without dependents who are in residential care an additional three years, through Nov. 30, 2031." The vote was on a motion to concur. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote of 380-35, thus the bill was sent to President Biden and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 546, [12/22/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll546.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/22/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/546?35); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7939](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7939/all-actions)\]

### Expiration Dates

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Specifying That The Accrued G.I. Bill Benefits Through Training Before August 1, 2025 Would Expire By August 1, 2040 And Benefits Thereafter Would Not Expire.** In January 2022, Schweikert voted against the Guard and Reserve G.I. Bill Parity Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "specify that such benefits accrued through training before Aug. 1, 2025, would expire by Aug. 1, 2040, while benefits accrued through training after that date would not expire." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 287-135. \[House Vote 6, [1/12/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll006.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/12/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/6?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1836](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1836/actions)\]

### Including Training As Eligible Service

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Expanding G.I. Bill Benefits For The National Guard And Reserve By Considering Training As Qualified Service Regarding Educational Aid.** In January 2022, Schweikert voted against the Guard and Reserve G.I. Bill Parity Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "expand GI Bill benefits for National Guard and Reserve members by including their training as eligible service with respect to educational assistance." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 287-135. \[House Vote 6, [1/12/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll006.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/12/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/6?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1836](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1836/actions)\]

-   **The Bill Would Include Training Days When Determining The G.I. Bill Benefits For The National Guard And Reserve Troops, Closing The Gap Between Them And Active Duty Members.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The first of the pair (HR 1836) would enable National Guard and Reserve troops to count training days when determining the amount of their GI bill benefits, on par with active duty servicemembers." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/10/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/committees-20220110478558?11)\]

-   **The Bill Would Include Training Hours To Count Toward Time Eligibility For Educational Assistance Under The G.I. Bill, So Reservists Would Be Able To Count Annual Trainings, Weekend Drills, And Certain Missions Towards The Eligibility Requirements.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House on Wednesday passed, 287-135, a bill (HR 1836) that would count certain training hours for reservists toward the time that earns them educational benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. That law (PL 110-252) provides U.S. military personnel the ability to access money for tuition, housing and other expenses, depending on the servicemembers' length of service. Military personnel who net 36 months or more on active duty can get about \$100,000 in such benefits. Reservists who are called to active duty for certain missions can earn hours needed to make them eligible for those GI Bill benefits. But the measure the House passed Wednesday, by California Democrat Mike Levin, would for the first time count annual training and weekend drills by National Guard and Reserves forces toward that service-time tally." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/13/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6431486?13)\]

-   **Under Current Law, National Guard And Military Reservists Do Not Accumulate The Same Benefits At Active-Duty Members.** According to The Hill, "National Guard and military reservists currently don't accrue the same benefits as their active-duty counterparts under the GI Bill, which helps qualifying veterans and their family members pay for higher education." \[The Hill, [1/12/22](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/589508-house-votes-to-expand-gi-benefits-for-national-guard-reserve-troops)\]

-   **The Bill Would Include Federal Missions And Training Days As Eligible Service Towards G.I. Benefits For The Guard And Reserve.** According to The Hill, "The legislation approved by the House would eliminate that disparity by allowing all federal missions, as well as training days in uniform, to count toward GI benefits for National Guard and Reserve troops." \[The Hill, [1/12/22](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/589508-house-votes-to-expand-gi-benefits-for-national-guard-reserve-troops)\]

-   **According To The Congressional Budget Office, This Bill Would Help More Than 40,000 National Guard And Reserve Troops Increase Their Eligibility For Benefits.** According to The Hill, "Based on data from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the increased eligibility under the bill would affect more than 40,000 National Guard and Reserve troops." \[The Hill, [1/12/22](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/589508-house-votes-to-expand-gi-benefits-for-national-guard-reserve-troops)\]

-   **The Republicans Who Opposed The Bill Claimed The Expansion Of Eligibility For Benefits Would Increase Costs.** According to The Hill, "But other Republicans argued that allowing training to count toward accruing GI benefits would drive up costs." \[The Hill, [1/12/22](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/589508-house-votes-to-expand-gi-benefits-for-national-guard-reserve-troops)\]

### Offsetting Costs

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Offsetting The Bill By Delaying Certain Rate Reductions In 2031 And Raising Rates For Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loans Closed From July 1, 2022 Through September 30, 2030.** In January 2022, Schweikert voted against the Guard and Reserve G.I. Bill Parity Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "modify borrower fee rates for certain VA housing loans by delaying certain scheduled rate reductions for several months in 2031 and increasing rates for interest rate reduction refinancing loans closed from July 1, 2022, through Sept. 30, 2030." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 287-135. \[House Vote 6, [1/12/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll006.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/12/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/6?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1836](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1836/actions)\]

### Raising Fees For Veterans Affairs Rate Reduction Housing Financing Loans

**2022: Schweikert Voted For An Amendment That Would Temporarily Raise Borrower Fee Rates For Veterans Affairs Rate Reduction Housing Refinancing Loans To Expand G.I. Bill Benefits For The National Guard And Reserve.** In January 2022, Schweikert voted for an amendment to the Guard and Reserve G.I. Bill Parity Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "strike the bill\'s text and replace it with provisions that would expand GI Bill benefits for National Guard and Reserve members by including certain mandatory drills and field exercises, not including training, as eligible active-duty service with respect to educational assistance. As an offset, it would temporarily increase borrower fee rates for VA interest rate reduction housing refinancing loans." The vote was on the adoption of an amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 198-225. \[House Vote 4, [1/12/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll004.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/12/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/4?5); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 152](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/117th-congress/house-amendment/152/actions?r=1&s=a); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1836](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1836/actions)\]

### Veterans Affair Benefits Information To New Veterans

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Providing New Veterans With Proper Information Over Their Eligibility For Medical Care, Including Care Provided Through Community Providers, Mental Health And Military Sexual Trauma Care.** In January 2022, Schweikert voted against the Guard and Reserve G.I. Bill Parity Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "also require the Veterans Affairs Department to provide new veterans with information regarding medical care they are eligible for through VA benefits, including care provided through community providers, mental health care and military sexual trauma care." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 287-135. \[House Vote 6, [1/12/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll006.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/12/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/6?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1836](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1836/actions)\]
