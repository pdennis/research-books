# Pascua Yaqui Tribe Land Acquisition

**2021: Schweikert Voted For Instructing The Interior Department To Take 31 Acres Of Land In Pima County, Arizona Into Trust At The Pascua Yaqui Tribe's Request, If The Tribe transfers The Land to The U.S., And Gaming Would Be Subject To Federal Law.** In November 2021, Schweikert voted for the Old Pascua Community Land Acquisition Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require the Interior Department to take approximately 31 acres of land in Pima County, Ariz. into trust at the request of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe of Arizona, adding the land to the Pascua Yaqui Reservation. It would deem such land as having been taken into trust on Sept. 18, 1978, and specify that gaming on the land would be subject to applicable federal law." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 397-25. \[House Vote 346, [11/2/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll346.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/2/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/346?24); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4881](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4881/actions)\]
