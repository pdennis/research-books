### Funding

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Appropriating \$4.4 Billion For Native American Education, Social Services And Workforce Programs For FY 2023.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2023, which would provide "\$4.4 billion for Native American education, social services and employment programs." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote 220-207, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate did not take substantive action on the legislation. Congress passed and signed into law the FY 2023 Budget through H.R. 2617. \[House Vote 383, [7/20/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll383.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/20/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/383?13); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8294](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8294/actions)\]
