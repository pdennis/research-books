### Native American Child Protection

**2023: Schweikert Voted For The Native American Child Protection Act.** In September 2023, Schweikert voted for a bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "place the Indian Child Abuse Treatment Grant Program under the jurisdiction of the Indian Health Service within the Health and Human Services Department. It would require the IHS to encourage the use of culturally appropriate treatment methods. The bill would require the IHS, within two years of enactment, to report to Congress on the awarding of grants and what they have been used to fund. The bill would also require HHS, within one year of enactment, to establish the National Indian Child Resource and Family Services Center, including a 12-member advisory board. It would require the board to assist the center in coordinating programs, identifying training and technical assistance materials, and developing intergovernmental agreements relating to family violence, child abuse and child neglect."

The House passed the bill by a vote of 378 to 32, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 394, [9/18/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll394.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/18/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/394?40); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 663](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/663/all-actions)\]
