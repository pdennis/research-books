# Indian Buffalo Management

**2021: Schweikert Voted For Authorizing \$14 Million Annually For Buffalo Habitat Management By Tribal Groups And To Promote The Use Of Buffalo For The Benefit Of Tribes.** In December 2021, Schweikert voted for the Indian Buffalo Management Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "permanently authorize \$14 million annually for Interior Department activities related to buffalo and buffalo habitat management by Native American tribes and tribal organizations and promoting the use of buffalo and buffalo habitat for the benefit of tribes. It would direct the department to award grants and provide technical assistance to tribes and tribal organizations for implementing buffalo restoration or management programs and related activities; regularly consult with tribes on initiatives that affect buffalo or buffalo habitat; and develop a policy relating to buffalo and buffalo habitat management activities on tribal land. It would also allow the department to enter into agreements with tribes to transport surplus buffalo from federal land to tribal land." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 373-52. \[House Vote 427, [12/8/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll427.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/8/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/427?23); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2074](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2074/actions)\]
