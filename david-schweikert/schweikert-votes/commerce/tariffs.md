### Solar Panel Tariff Rule

**2023: Schweikert Voted To Override President Biden's Veto And Disapprove A Commerce Department Rule That Suspended The Tariffs For Solar Panel Materials Assembled In Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand Or Vietnam Using Parts Manufactured In China.** In May 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted to override President Biden's veto on the resolution that would "provide for congressional disapproval of the September 2022 Commerce Department rule that provided for the suspension of duties for certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules, or solar panels, assembled in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand or Vietnam using parts and components manufactured in China. The rule took effect on Nov. 15, 2022. Under the provisions of the joint resolution, the Commerce Department rule would have no force or effect." The vote was on a veto override. The House failed to acquire a 2/3 majority and rejected the motion by a vote of 214 to 205, thus the veto was sustained. \[House Vote 233, [5/24/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll233.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/24/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/233?25); Congressional Actions, [H.J.

-   **President Biden Argued That The Rule Created A "Bridge" For New Domestic Solar Businesses And Allowed Domestic Solar Panel Manufacturing To Increase.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "In a message to the House, Biden said the rule creates a 'bridge' for new solar businesses in the U.S., which are largely dependent on China for materials like silicon wafers and photovoltaic cells, to grow. 'America is now on track to increase domestic solar panel manufacturing capacity eight-fold by the end of my first term,' Biden said. 'Passage of this resolution bets against American innovation.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/16/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7744513?28)\]
