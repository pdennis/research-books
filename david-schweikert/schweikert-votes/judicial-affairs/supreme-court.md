### Statutes Honoring Justices O'Connor and Ginsburg

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Commission Statutes Honoring Former Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor And Ruth Bader Ginsburg In The U.S. Capitol Or Capitol Grounds.** In March 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for a bill that would "direct the Joint Committee of Congress on the Library, within two years of enactment, to commission statues honoring former Supreme Court associate justices Sandra Day O\'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg and permanently install each statue in the U.S. Capitol or on the Capitol Grounds. It would require the committee to consider artists from a variety of backgrounds to create the statues, including artists from underrepresented demographic groups. It would authorize the committee to use up to \$500,000 from the Capitol Preservation Fund to create and install each statue." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 349-63, thus the bill was sent to the President and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 84, [3/28/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll084.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/28/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/84?23); Congressional Actions, [S. 3294](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3294/actions)\]
