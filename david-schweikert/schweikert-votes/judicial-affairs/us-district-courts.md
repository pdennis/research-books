# U.S. District Courts

### Authority

**2025: Schweikert Voted To Limit The Authority Of U.S. District Courts To Issue Nationwide Injunctions.** In April 2025, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would prohibit any U.S. district court from providing an order for injunctive relief, unless the order is to limit the actions of the defendant against the party seeking injunctive relief. The bill would allow a case challenging an executive action to be referred to a three-judge panel if the case is brought by two or more states located in different circuits. It would require the panel of judges to be randomly selected and not by the chief judge of the circuit. It would allow the three-judge panel to issue an injunction that would otherwise be prohibited under the bill\'s provisions. It also would require the panel to consider the interest of justice, the risk of irreparable harm to non-parties, and the preservation of the constitutional separation of powers in determining whether to issue the injunction. The bill also would stipulate that an appeal of an order granting or denying injunctive relief decided by the panel could be heard by the appropriate circuit court or the Supreme Court." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 219 to 213. \[House Vote 98, [4/9/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll098.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/9/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/98?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1526](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1526/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Prohibited District Courts From Issuing Injunctions against Parties Not Involved In A Case Following Rulings Related To Trump's Executive Orders.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House passed a bill Wednesday that would curtail the power of federal district judges to issue nationwide injunctions, the most high-profile legislative pushback from Republicans to a string of rulings that have stymied certain executive actions from the Trump administration.The chamber voted 219-213 to approve a bill (HR 1526) that would stop those judges from handing down injunctive relief orders that apply to parties that are not involved in the case, except in certain situations. The measure, for example, has an exception for certain cases brought by multiple states." \[Congressional Quarterly, [4/9/25](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8219713?13)\]
