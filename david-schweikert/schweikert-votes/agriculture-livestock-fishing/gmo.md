# Genetically Modified Organisms

### Food Labeling

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Require Food Labels Disclosing The Presence Of Genetically Modified Food; Legislation Would Pre-empt Any State Law And Would Allow The Label To Be Displayed As An Electronic Bar Code.** In July 2016, Schweikert voted for a bill requiring the disclosure of the presence of genetically modified food. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "require\[d\] the Department of Agriculture to establish a national mandatory disclosure standard for genetically modified food within two years of the bill's enactment. It also would \[have\] pre-empt\[ed\] state requirements related to labeling genetically modified food and states would \[have\] be\[en\] prohibited from establishing disclosure standards that differ from the national standards. Companies could opt to provide disclosure through a symbol or by electronic bar codes that consumers could scan with their smart phones. Food served in restaurants and 'very small food manufacturers' would be excluded from the standards." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the bill. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 306 to 117. Since the Senate had already agreed to the legislation, the bill went to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 466, [7/14/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll466.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/7/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/S/123?37); Congressional Actions, [S. 764](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/764/all-actions)\]
