# Animal Welfare

### Animal Fighting

**2018: Schweikert Voted To Apply The Prohibition Against Animal Fighting To All U.S. States And Territories.** In May 2018, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "extend\[ed\] the prohibition on animal fighting ventures to all states and U.S. territories." The underlying bill was the 2018 House GOP farm bill. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 359 to 51. The House later rejected the overall farm bill, but on a revote, passed the bill. A modified version of the bill later became law. \[House Vote 202, [5/18/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll202.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/18/18](http://cq.com/vote/2018/H/202?14); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 630](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/115th-congress/house-amendment/630/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2/all-actions)\]

-   **Rep. Peter Roskam (R-IL): While Animal Fighting Is Illegal In All Fifty States, Some Types Are Legal In Some U.S. Territories.** According to a floor speech by Rep. Roskam, "So here is the situation: Animal fighting is inappropriate and wrong no matter where it happens. It is against the law in the continental United States, and, I should say, in all 50 States, and what we are proposing is to make that a standard in the territories as well. There are some elements of animal fighting that is illegal in territories, but not altogether. This has been a long journey. It is a 40-year journey in this country. It reached a crescendo about 10 years ago when a standard was created in all 50 States. What this amendment does, Mr. Chairman, is very simple: it proposes to do the same thing in the territories." \[Congressional Record, [5/18/18](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2018/05/18/CREC-2018-05-18-pt1-PgH4213-2.pdf)\]

**2018: Schweikert Voted Against The Final 2018 Conference Report Farm Bill Which Reauthorized Farm Programs And Food Stamps And Barred The Slaughter Of Cats And Dogs For Human Food.** In December 2018, Schweikert voted against the 2018 farm bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Adoption of the conference report on the bill that would reauthorize and extend federal farm and nutrition programs through fiscal 2023, including crop subsidies, conservation, rural development and agricultural trade programs and the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. It would reauthorize and extend supplemental agricultural disaster assistance programs, sugar policies and loan rates, several international food aid programs, nonrecourse marketing assistance loans for loan commodities, and several dairy programs, including the dairy risk management program (previously the margin protection program). It would create new pilot programs that would test strategies for improving the accuracy of the SNAP income verification process. It would allow industrial hemp to be grown in the United States, subject to close regulation at the state level. It would modify the activities permitted on land contracted under the conservation reserve program." The vote was on the conference report. The House passed the legislation by a vote of 369 to 47. The Senate had earlier passed the bill and was later signed into law by the president. \[House Vote 434, [12/12/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll434.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/12/18](http://cq.com/vote/2018/H/434?0); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2/all-actions)\]
