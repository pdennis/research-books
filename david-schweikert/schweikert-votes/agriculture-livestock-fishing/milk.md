# Milk

### Milk Price Support

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Repeal Permanent Price Support For Milk.** In June 2013, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "repeal permanent price support authority for milk." The underlying legislation was a farm bill. The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 112 to 309. \[House Vote 258, [6/19/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll258.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/19/13](http://cq.com/vote/2013/H/258?32); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 181](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/181/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1947](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1947/all-actions)\]

### Natural Cheese

**2018: Schweikert Voted To Define "Natural Cheese" Labeling To Only Include Cheese Produced From Animal Milk Or Other Dairy Ingredients And Is Made By Established Cheese-Making Techniques.** In December 2018, Schweikert voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "'natural cheese' as cheese that is produced from animal milk or other dairy ingredients and is produced in accordance with established cheese-making practices. Under the measure, a food product is considered mislabeled if it includes the term 'natural cheese' as a factual descriptor of a category of cheese unless the food meets the definition of natural cheese. The bill uses existing regulations that define different types of cheese and specifies which of these cheeses can be considered natural. In general, pasteurized process cheeses, pasteurized process cheese spreads, pasteurized blended cheeses, cold pack cheeses, grated American cheese food and any other product designated as a process cheese is not a natural cheese. Milk is also defined according to existing regulations and the bill specifically states that milk can come from animals other than cows." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill, which required a 2/3 majority, or 262 affirmative votes in favor for this vote. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 230 to 162. The House took no further action. \[House Vote 463, [12/20/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll463.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/19/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5433890?2); Congressional Actions, [S. 2322](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2322/all-actions)\]

-   **'Natural' On A Food Label Has No Current Definition, But A 2015 Consumer Reports Survey Found That A Majority Of Americans Thought It Had Some Legal Meaning.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Currently the word 'natural' on the label of a food product has no defined meaning: manufacturers of products from chips to oil to cheese characterize the foods they produce as natural in an effort to entice consumers to buy them. Despite the fact that there is no federal standard for what constitutes 'natural' food, a 2015 Consumer Reports survey found that more than half of consumers seek out products that have 'natural' on their label and many believe these products do not contain genetically modified organisms, hormones, pesticides or artificial ingredients. While the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has asked for public comment on how the word 'natural' should or should not be used on food labels, it has not issued regulatory guidance to this effect." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/19/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5433890?2)\]

### Subsides

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating Milk Subsides.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted for a budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555, [10/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll555.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/5/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/555?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

Res. 71](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/71/all-actions)\]

-   **Budget Called To Eliminate Numerous Milk Programs.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Eliminate the Milk Program 'The U.S. dairy market is a complex tangle of subsidies and price supports.'290 Even the market for a commodity as basic as milk is not free from massively inappropriate government interference. The 2014 Farm Bill established two new programs, the Margin Protection Program (MPP) and the Dairy Product Donation Program (DPDP), which respectively makes payments to farmers when margins fall below certain amounts and requires the government to purchase and distribute dairy products when margins fall below a certain level. Additionally, there are a number of other dairy subsidy programs, including the Livestock Gross Margin for Dairy Cattle program (LGM-D), Dairy Import Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs), and milk marketing orders. Further, the 1949 Dairy Price Support Program remains permanent law, which will once again create a 'milk cliff' when the MPP expires at the end of 2018.291 This central planning does not work, as proven by the USDA being forced to purchase \$30 million worth of dairy products to alleviate a 'cheese glut'.292 Instead, the milk market should be governed by the common sense laws of supply and demand. In addition to benefiting consumers and producers alike, eliminating federal dairy subsidy programs will save taxpayers \$749 million over the next decade. Once again, the private market is more than capable of providing the risk-mitigation benefits claimed by dairy program supporters without foisting speculative risk onto taxpayers." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed 10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]

### Unpasteurized Milk

**2018: Schweikert Voted To Restrict The Federal Government From Preventing Interstate Transportation Of Unpasteurized Milk Between States That Allow It For Human Consumption.** In May 2018, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit federal interference in the interstate transportation of unpasteurized milk and milk products between states that allow for the distribution of such products for direct human consumption." The underlying bill was the 2018 House GOP farm bill. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 79 to 331. \[House Vote 201, [5/18/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll201.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/18/18](http://cq.com/vote/2018/H/201?13); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 627](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/115th-congress/house-amendment/627/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2/all-actions)\]
