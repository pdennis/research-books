### Alternative Protein Research

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Shifted \$1.5 Million Within The Agriculture Research Service To Increase Funding For Alternative Protein Research.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against en bloc amendments no. 3 to the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2023, which would, in part, "increase and decrease Agriculture Research Service funding by \$1.5 million intended to increase funding for alternative protein research." The vote was on the adoption of amendments. The House adopted the amendments by a vote 225-201. \[House Vote 369, [7/19/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll369.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/19/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/369?3); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 295](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/117th-congress/house-amendment/295/actions?s=a&r=7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8294](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8294/actions)\]
