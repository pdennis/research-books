### Agriculture Marketing Orders And Check-Off Programs

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating The Agriculture Marketing Orders And Check-Off Programs.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted for a budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555, [10/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll555.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/5/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/555?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating The Agriculture Marketing Orders And Check-Off Programs.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Eliminate Agriculture Marketing Orders and Check-off Programs The federal government currently operates 29 marketing orders for different fruits, vegetables, and specialty crops. These agreements, which date back to the market intrusions of the New Deal, allow the government to collude with segments of certain industries to restrict the supply of food to consumers. The cartels created by the agreement are given tools such as volume controls, minimum quality standards, and packaging requirements.293 The USDA also operates 22 'Research & Promotion' programs, better known as check-off programs. These programs impose a mandatory fee on the sale of covered commodities which are used to fund promotional activities of the relevant Research & Promotion Program board. The result of these arrangements is that producers are taxed using the force of government to fund advertising activities they might not otherwise be willing to pay for and may not actually benefit from. This, in turn, results in increased prices for consumers. Beginning in FY 2018, both marketing orders and check-off programs should be eliminated." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed 10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]
