# Marine Mammals

### Protections

**2019: Schweikert Voted For Loosening Restrictions On A NOAA Rule That Protects Marine Mammals From Seismic Exploration Companies.** In December 2019, Schweikert voted for a bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "modify provisions related to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration authorization of activities that may result in the incidental 'taking,' including killing or harassment, of marine mammals under an exemption from an existing moratorium prohibiting the taking and importing of marine mammals. It would require that conditions imposed under such NOAA authorizations would not result in more than minor changes to or alter the location or design of the authorized activity. It would modify requirements related to applications, approval, and extension for such authorizations." The vote was on adoption. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 160-259. \[House Vote 666, [12/10/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll666.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/10/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/666?24); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt.709](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/116th-congress/house-amendment/709); Congressional Actions, [H.R.729](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/729/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%22hr+729%22%7d&s=5&r=23)\]
