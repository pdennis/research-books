# Industrial Hemp

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2020 Minibus Appropriations Bill, Which Facilitated The Interstate Transportation of Hemp.** In December 2019, Schweikert voted against the FY 2020 minibus spending bill, which represented 8 of the 12 appropriations bills. According to Politico, "Appropriators included a provision that would bar the use of federal funds to prohibit interstate transportation of hemp or interfere with processing, sales or use of legally grown hemp. Producers and shippers have faced legal snags trying to move the plant across state lines, thanks to a messy patchwork of state laws. The new language effectively backs up USDA's May guidance on the topic." The vote was a motion to concur in the Senate amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 297-120. The Senate later passed the bill and the President signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 689, [12/17/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll689.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/17/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/689?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R.1865](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1865/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+1865%22%5D%7d&s=4&r=1)\]
