# Big Cats

### Possession And Breeding Ban

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Ban The Breeding And Possession Of Certain Big Cats, Such as Tifers, Lions, Jaguars And Cougars, With The Exception To Wildlife Sanctuaries, Zoos, Veterinarians, And Universities.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Big Cat Public Safety Act, which would "generally prohibit the breeding or possession of certain big cats, including tigers, lions, jaguars, cougars and hybrids. It would provide exceptions for entities including wildlife sanctuaries, zoos, veterinarians and universities. It would allow individuals currently in possession of big cats to retain them if they register each individual animal with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, do not breed or sell the animals, and maintain distances or permanent barriers to prevent direct contact between the animals and the public. It would establish criminal penalties of up to \$20,000 in fines or up to five years imprisonment for violations of the bill\'s provisions." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 278-134, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate passed the bill, sent it to President Biden, and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 415, [7/29/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll415.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/415?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 263](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/263/actions)\]
