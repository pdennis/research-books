### Ammunition

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Allow The Use Of Lead Ammunition When Hunting On Federal Land.** In April 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would prohibit the Interior and Agriculture departments from banning the use of lead ammunition or tackle on federal lands or waters that are under their jurisdiction and made available for hunting or fishing. It also would prevent the departments from issuing regulations relating to the level of lead ammunition or tackle being used on these lands. The prohibition on such bans would not apply to regulations in cases where an applicable department determines a decline in wildlife is triggered by the use of lead ammunition or tackle, or when the regulations against lead are consistent with state policy. It also would not apply if regulations against lead are consistent with an applicable policy of the fish and wildlife department of the state where the federal land or water is located." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 214 to 201. \[House Vote 167, [4/30/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll167.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/30/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/167?13); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 615](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/615/all-actions)\]

-   **Since The 1990's, Alaska Has Aimed To Support A Higher Number Of Game Species By Reducing Predator Population; This Violates Fish And Wildlife Regulations If Not Based On Sound Science.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Since the mid-1990s, \[Alaska's\] management policy has aimed to support a high number of game species by reducing the population of predators, a practice commonly known as predator control. However, unless based on 'sound science,' predator control violates FWS's statutory obligations to ensure biological integrity, diversity and environmental health of refuges and its wildlife by not favoring one species over another." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/10/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5040651/10?114&search=b6LCd0LZ)\]

-   **Rule Prohibited Aggressive Predator Control Practices In National Wildlife Refuges In Alaska, Specifically Prohibiting "The Taking Of Mother Bears And Their Cubs, The Taking Of Brown Bears By Luring Them With 'Bait' (I.E., Food), The Killing Of Wolves And Their Pups At Den Sites, And Aerial Shooting In National Wildlife Refuges."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The FWS last year finalized a rule focused on wildlife refuges that prohibits aggressive predator control practices in national wildlife refuges in Alaska, to ensure that those refuges are managed consistently with federal laws, regulations and FWS policies. Specifically, the rule prohibits the taking of mother bears and their cubs, the taking of brown bears by luring them with 'bait' (i.e., food), the killing of wolves and their pups at den sites, and aerial shooting in national wildlife refuges. The final rule was issued on Aug. 5, 2016, and took effect on Sept. 6, 2016." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/10/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5040651/10?114&search=b6LCd0LZ)\]

-   **As Part Of The Alaska Statehood Compact, Alaska Generally Manages Hunting And Gaming On Federal Land, Which In Alaska Is About The Same Size As The State Of New Mexico.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "There are 76.8 million acres of wildlife refuges in Alaska --- roughly equal in size to New Mexico. Under the Alaska Statehood Compact and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA; PL 96-487), Alaska, unlike most states, generally manages hunting and trapping on federal lands (including national wildlife refuges) through a partnership with the Interior Department\'s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) unless the management violates federal policy. \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/10/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5040651/10?114&search=b6LCd0LZ)\]
