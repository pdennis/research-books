### Presidential Tax Returns

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Requiring Audits On All Income Tax Returns For The President, President's Spouse, And Any Entity, Trust Or Estate They Control.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the Presidential Tax Filings and Audit Transparency Act of 2022, which would "require the IRS to conduct audits to examine the correctness of all income tax returns filed with respect to the president, the president's spouse, and any entity, trust or estate that they control. The bill would require the IRS to publish initial findings of the audit within 90 days of the filing, followed by periodic reports every 180 days until its completion. It would require the reports to include the status of the audit and time frame for completion and require the final report to include a description of any proposed adjustment, adjustment made, or controversy with respect to the tax returns. The bill would specify that if the president does not file their returns, the IRS must audit their taxable information for that tax year, within 60 days of the filing due date, and that the IRS must conduct separate audits on any amendment or supplement to a tax return." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 222-201, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 539, [12/22/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll539.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/22/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/539?10); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 9640](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/9640/all-actions)\]

-   **Most House Republicans Viewed The Bill As A Partisan Attack On Former President Trump.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "In the House, only five Republicans joined all Democrats in voting for the measure, which most in the GOP dismissed as a partisan attack on Trump." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/22/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7629034?13)\]
