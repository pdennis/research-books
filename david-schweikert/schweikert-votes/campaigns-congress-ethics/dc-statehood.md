# D.C. Statehood

### Supporting D.C. Statehood

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Granting Statehood To The District Of Columbia, Which Would Grant Governmental Representation In Congress, Allow Residents To Participate In Federal Elections, And Repeal The 23rd Amendment Of The Constitution.** In April 2021, Schweikert voted against the Washington, D.C. Admission Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for the establishment of most of the current District of Columbia as the 51st state in the Union, to be known as Washington, Douglass Commonwealth. It would require, within 30 days of enactment, an election for two senators and one representative for the state in Congress. It would then require the president to issue a proclamation announcing the election results, at which point the state would be admitted into the Union. The bill would define the territory and boundaries of a revised District of Columbia, which would remain under federal control \-- including the White House, Capitol building, Supreme Court, and federal office buildings located adjacent to the National Mall and Capitol. All other territory of the current district would be part of the new state. It would provide that district executive, legislative and judicial officers at the time of admission would serve in the respective offices of the state; the state would be considered the legal successor to the district in continued judicial proceedings; and the federal government would retain control of lands currently held for defense or Coast Guard purposes. It would prohibit federal law enforcement agencies from enforcing state laws without state authorization. It would also allow residents of the new federal district to vote in federal elections by absentee ballot in their last state of residence and provide for the repeal of the 23rd amendment to the Constitution, which granted District of Columbia residents the right to vote in presidential elections." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 216-208. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 132, [4/22/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll132.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/22/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/132?9); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 51](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/51/actions)\]

-   **Statehood To D.C. "Would Shrink The Federal District To A Nearly Two-Square Mile Federal Capital Enclave That Includes The National Monuments" And All Other Federal Government Buildings, While The Remaining Territory Would Become The 51st State Renamed Washington, Douglass Commonwealth.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Constitution requires that the seat of the federal government remain independent of any state. Today, that includes the entirety of D.C., but the measure would shrink the federal district to a nearly two-square-mile federal capital enclave that includes the national monuments, the Capitol, the White House, the Supreme Court and other nearby federal office buildings. The remaining portion would be admitted to the union as the 51st state named Washington, Douglass Commonwealth, after abolitionist and D.C. resident Frederick Douglass." \[Congressional Quarterly, [4/14/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/committees-20210414460802?11)\]

H.R. 1, a pro-democracy bill that includes numerous findings to expand democracy in the United States, contains extensive findings supporting statehood for D.C. This achievement builds on Norton's work to make D.C the 51st state and sets the stage for consideration of H.R. 51, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act."
