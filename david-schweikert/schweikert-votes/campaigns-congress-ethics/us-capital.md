### Freedom Foyer

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Renaming The Small House Rotunda As The "Freedom Foyer" As Part Of The Of The Bipartisan Budget Act Of 2015.** In October 2015, Schweikert voted against renaming the small House rotunda as the "Freedom Foyer." According to Congressional Quarterly, "The agreement designates the first floor of the area of the House of Representatives wing of the U.S. Capitol known as the small House rotunda as the \"Freedom Foyer.\" Busts of Winston Churchill, Lajos Kossuth and Vaclav Havel are on display in the foyer." The measure was part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which also "would suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2017 and increase\[d\] the discretionary spending cap for fiscal 2016 by \$50 billion and for fiscal 2017 by \$30 billion, with the increases split equally between defense and non-defense spending" among other provisions." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment with an amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 266 to 167. The Senate later passed the bill and the president later signed it into law. \[House Vote 579, [10/30/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll579.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/30/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/S/292?3); Congressional Quarterly, [10/27/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4780157?6); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1314](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1314/all-actions)\]
