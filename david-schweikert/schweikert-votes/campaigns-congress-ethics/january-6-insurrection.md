The vote was on passage.

A longtime Trump confidant, Scavino was with the then-president during key moments on Jan. 6, and call records suggest Trump reached out to him by phone that evening. Scavino was also intimately involved in Trump's social media strategy and may have insights into the December 2020 decision to call supporters to a 'wild' protest in Washington on Jan. 6, a tweet that was seen among extremists as a call to action." \[Politico, [4/6/22](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/06/house-votes-dan-scavino-peter-navarro-in-contempt-00023619)\]

Brand has contended that Scavino negotiated in good faith and was seeking legitimate clarity on the requests the committee had been making, as well as the parameters of its questioning." \[Politico, [4/6/22](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/06/house-votes-dan-scavino-peter-navarro-in-contempt-00023619)\]

-   **Navarro Was Subpoenaed In February 2022, In Which He Rejected The Requires By Contending He Was Prohibited From Cooperating Due To Executive Privilege, But The Committee Emphasized Trump Did Not Make A Formal Assertion Of Executive Privilege.** According to Politico, "The committee subpoenaed Navarro in February, prompting an immediate response from him rejecting its request and contending he was barred by executive privilege from cooperating. The committee has pointed out that Trump made no formal assertion of executive privilege in connection with his testimony --- and the panel has rejected the notion that Trump, as a former president, has any ability to assert privilege over his former advisers' testimony." \[Politico, [4/6/22](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/06/house-votes-dan-scavino-peter-navarro-in-contempt-00023619)\]

-   **Navarro Was One Of Trump's Backers That Supported The Effort To Overturn The 2020 Election Results And Collaborated With Steve Bannon To Strategize The Persuasion Of Republicans To Vote Against Certifying Electors.** According to Politico, "Navarro became one of Trump's loudest backers in the effort to subvert the 2020 election and worked closely with Bannon to develop a strategy to persuade Republicans in Congress to vote against certifying dozens of Joe Biden's electors." \[Politico, [4/6/22](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/06/house-votes-dan-scavino-peter-navarro-in-contempt-00023619)\]

The House adopted the rule by a vote of 221-200. \[House Vote 117, [4/6/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll117.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/6/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/117?16); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 1037](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/1037/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 1023](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/1023/actions)\]

-   **While Bannon Briefly Served As A White House Adviser To Former President Trump, The Resolution Vote On His Connection To The Select Committee Would Be Based On His Actions After Left His Government Position.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "But the vote on Stephen Bannon in connection with the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol extends that partisan divide to those outside government as well. Although Bannon was a one-time White House adviser to President Donald Trump, his actions after leaving government service are at issue for the panel." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/21/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6370296?31)\]
