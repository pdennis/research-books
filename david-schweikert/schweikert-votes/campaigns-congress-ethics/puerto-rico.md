# Puerto Rico

### Referendum

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Requiring Puerto Rico State Elections Commission To Hold A Referendum, Which Would Determine Puerto Rico's Status As An Independent Sovereign Nation, A Sovereign Nation In Free Association With The United States, Or A U.S. State.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the Puerto Rico Status Act, which would "require the Puerto Rico State Elections Commission to hold a plebiscite on Nov. 5, 2023, to determine the political status of Puerto Rico and establish transitional procedures based on the vote outcome. It would require a majority vote to approve Puerto Rico's status as an independent sovereign nation, a sovereign nation in free association with the United States or a U.S. state. If no status receives a majority of votes, it would require a runoff election on March 3, 2024. The bill would establish procedures for the Justice Department to review ballot design and voter education materials for the plebiscite and authorize such sums as necessary for the Puerto Rico elections commission to carry out a voter education campaign on how each outcome would impact international representation, citizenship and immigration, and treatment under U.S. federal law and programs. In the case of statehood, the bill would require the U.S. president, upon receiving the plebiscite results, to issue a proclamation admitting Puerto Rico to the Union as a state, effective within one year. It would specify that the current constitution of Puerto Rico would be its state constitution, and all territorial laws would continue until amended or repealed by the state. It would provide for Puerto Rico to elect two senators and the same number of House members as the state with the census population closest to, but less than, that of Puerto Rico, temporarily increasing total House membership until the next census-based reapportionment cycle. In the case of independence or free association, the bill would require the election of delegates to a constitutional convention within six months of the election's certification; a vote on ratification of the constitution within one year of the convention; and an election for officers of the new nation within one month of ratification. It would require the U.S. president to establish a joint transition commission tasked with transferring government functions to the Puerto Rican government and, within one month of Puerto Rico's election of officers, issue a proclamation to surrender U.S. control over Puerto Rico. In the case of free association, the bill would also require the establishment of a bilateral negotiating commission to expedite the transfer of federal functions and negotiate the government-to-government relationship between the two nations under articles of free association, which may subsequently be terminated by either party at will. The bill would allow benefits available to current Puerto Rico residents, such as Social Security and veterans' benefits, to be administered through the Puerto Rican government until such benefits are extinguished. It would specify that current U.S. citizens would not lose citizenship as a result of the plebiscite or obtaining Puerto Rican citizenship, but individuals born in Puerto Rico to a parent who became a U.S. citizen under previous law that made Puerto Rican residents citizens would not become U.S. citizens at birth, other than during a transition period under the articles of free association. It would allow Puerto Rican citizens who are not U.S. citizens to enter, work and establish residence in the United States as nonimmigrants without obtaining a visa for a 25-year transition period following Puerto Rican independence or as long as the two countries remain in free association." The vote was on a passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 233 -- 191. The Senate took no action on the legislation. \[House Vote 529, [12/15/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll529.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/15/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/529?2); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8393](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8393/all-actions?overview=closed#tabs)\]

-   **The Bill Established Procedures For The Justice Department To Review Ballot Design And Voter Education Materials For The Referendum And Authorized The Necessary Funds For Puerto Rico's Elections Commission To Carry Out The Voter Education Campaign.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill would establish procedures for the Justice Department to review ballot design and voter education materials for the plebiscite and authorize such sums as necessary for the Puerto Rico elections commission to carry out a voter education campaign on how each outcome would impact international representation, citizenship and immigration, and treatment under U.S. federal law and programs." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/15/22](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022529?Page=2&RollCallNum=529)\]

-   **The Bill Would Have Given Puerto Ricans The Ability To Determine The Island's Future Relationship With The U.S., Including Whether To Become An Official U.S. State.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House has passed legislation that would let voters in Puerto Rico determine the island territory's future relationship with the United States, including whether to become a state." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/15/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7623067?9)\]

-   **The Bill Would Have Provided Three Outcomes For A Plebiscite, Would Have Directed The President To Help Implement The Outcome, And Would Have Allowed Puerto Rico To Become Independent Or Join The U.S. As A State Without Further Congressional Action.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill proposes three choices for a plebiscite, and it would direct the president to take action to help implement whatever option secures a majority vote in support, either during a regular election or a runoff. In effect, Puerto Rico could become a state or move toward independence without further action by Congress if the measure became law." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/15/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7623067?9)\]

-   **Republicans Expressed Concerns With Transferring Military Bases Back To The U.S. If Puerto Rico Were To Become Independent And The Potential Taxpayer Burden To Pay Back Relief Funds Given To Puerto Rico During Natural Disasters.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans withholding their support for the measure have cited complications with transferring military bases back to the United States should the island become sovereign or independent, and the potential burden on taxpayers to pay back relief funds given to the island during natural disasters. They have also taken issue with the lack of a fiscal impact score from the Congressional Budget Office." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/15/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7623067?9)\]
