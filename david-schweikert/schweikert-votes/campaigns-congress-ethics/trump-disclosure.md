### Conflict Of Interest

**2018: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Amending A Financial Reform Bill To Clarify That Nothing In The Underlying Bill Could Benefit The President, His Family Or Other Senior Executive Branch.** In March 2018, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prevent\[ed\] changes in financial regulations in the bill from being made at the request of, or for the personal gain of, the president, a member of his family, or other senior Executive Branch official." The underlying legislation, also according to Congressional Quarterly, "requires federal financial regulators to tailor their rules and regulations on covered institutions in a manner that is appropriate to the business models of the different types and classes of financial institutions. It would apply to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Fed), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 182 to 232. \[House Vote 107, [3/14/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll107.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/14/18](http://cq.com/vote/2018/H/107?5); Congressional Quarterly, [3/14/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5280261/12?9); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1116](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1116/all-actions)\]

The underlying legislation would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] federal agencies to maintain and regularly update detailed online databases of regulatory actions taken and pending before the agency." The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 189 to 232. \[House Vote 125, [3/2/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll125.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/2/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/125?5); Congressional Quarterly, [3/2/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/126?6); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1004](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1004/all-actions)\]

The underlying legislation, also according to Congressional Quarterly, "establish\[ed\] a nine-member commission to review existing federal regulations and identify regulations that should be repealed on the basis of reducing costs on the U.S. economy. The commission would identify those regulatory policies that should be repealed immediately, and would set up a 'Cut-Go' system that would require agencies to repeal existing rules to offset costs before issuing a new rule. The measure, as amended, would require the commission to review a rule or regulation's unfunded mandate, whether the rule or regulation limits or prevents government agencies from adopting technology to improve efficiency, and the rule or regulation's impact on wage growth, when determining if the rule or regulation should be repealed." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the amendment by the motion by a vote of 190 to 235. \[House Vote 113, [3/1/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll113.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/1/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/113?7); Congressional Quarterly, [1/7/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/20?12); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 998](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/998/all-actions)\]
