### Supreme Court Justice Ethics

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against Requiring Supreme Court Justices Be Subject To A Code Of Ethics As Part Of A Larger Anti-Corruption And Democracy Reform Bill.** In March 2019, Schweikert voted against The 'For The People Act.' According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill requires the Judicial Conference of the United States to develop and issue a code of ethics for the U.S. Supreme Court. Under the measure, this code of ethics must be issued within one year of enactment; the Judicial Conference is the national policy-making body for the federal courts." The overall was, also according to CBS News, "the most sweeping anti-corruption measure passed by the House of Representatives in a generation, by a vote of 234 to 193. The bill focuses on voting rights, campaign finance, and government ethics." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 234 to 193. \[House Vote 118, [3/8/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll118.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/5/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5476854?1); CBS News, [3/8/19](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-passes-hr-1-sweeping-anti-corruption-and-voting-rights-legislation-today-2019-03-08/); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions)\]
