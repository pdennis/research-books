### Public Record

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Would Create A Public Record Of Political Advertisements On Online Platforms.** In March 2021, Schweikert voted against en bloc amendments no.4 to the For The People Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require online platforms to generate a public record of political advertisements." The vote was on adoption of amendments.
