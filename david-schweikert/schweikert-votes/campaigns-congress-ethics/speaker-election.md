-   **Johnson Was The Fourth Republican Nominee And The Only To Receive No Republican Opposition.** According to the New York Times, "Mr. Johnson faced no opposition from his own party, and won in a party-line vote. In previous rounds of voting, as many as 25 Republicans opposed their party's nominee. Mr. Johnson was the Republican Party's fourth nominee for speaker in the last two weeks." \[New York Times, [10/25/23](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/10/17/us/politics/house-speaker-vote-tally.html)\]

He was also an architect of Mr. Trump's bid to object to certifying them in Congress on Jan. 6, 2021. Mr. Trump praised him on Wednesday after his election, calling the Louisiana Republican 'a fantastic gentleman.'" \[New York Times, [10/25/23](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/us/politics/house-republicans-speaker-vote-johnson.html)\]

Mike Johnson Opposed Abortion And LGBTQ Rights.** According to the New York Times, "The elevation of Mr. Johnson, 51, an architect of the effort to overturn the 2020 election and a religious conservative opposed to abortion rights, homosexuality and gay marriage, further cemented the Republican Party's lurch to the right." \[New York Times, [10/25/23](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/us/politics/house-republicans-speaker-vote-johnson.html)\]

He cited sending aid to Israel, fixing a 'broken' southern border, and reining in federal spending as his top legislative priorities." \[New York Times, [10/25/23](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/us/politics/house-republicans-speaker-vote-johnson.html)\]

But this time the other four Republicans who voted against McCarthy on the 14th ballot --- Arizona's Andy Biggs and Eli Crane, Virginia's Bob Good and Montana's Matt Rosendale --- also voted 'present.' \[...\] The six 'present' votes lowered the threshold McCarthy needed to win to 215.

-   **McCarthy Promised Proportional Representation Of House Freedom Caucus Members On Committees Compared To Other Republican Ideological Groups.** According to Roll Call, "McCarthy also agreed to ensure the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, which most of his flipped opponents are members of, has proportional representation on committees compared to other ideological groups in the Republican Conference." \[Roll Call, [1/7/23](https://rollcall.com/2023/01/07/mccarthy-wins-speaker-election-finally/)\]

-   **McCarthy Promised To Restore A Procedural Rule For Ousting A Sitting House Speaker By Allowing One Member To Force A Recall Vote Whenever.** According to Roll Call, "And perhaps most importantly, the California Republican agreed to restore a longstanding rule on the procedure for ousting a sitting speaker to allow one member to force a recall vote at any time. His detractors said this concession was needed to ensure accountability, as they didn't inherently trust McCarthy to make the changes he promised without a backstop." \[Roll Call, [1/7/23](https://rollcall.com/2023/01/07/mccarthy-wins-speaker-election-finally/)\]

-   **McCarthy Was Able To Flip 14 Out Of The 20 Republicans Who Voted Against His Nominations And Last-Minute Negotiations Led To The Final 6 Republicans To Vote Present Instead.** According to Roll Call, "In the end McCarthy's commitments flipped 14 of the 20 Republicans who voted against him on earlier rounds of balloting. And some last-minute floor negotiations led the rest of his detractors to vote 'present' and lower the threshold needed for him to squeeze out the win." \[Roll Call, [1/7/23](https://rollcall.com/2023/01/07/mccarthy-wins-speaker-election-finally/)\]

### Vacate The Office Of The Speaker

**2024: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Vacating The Office Of The Speaker.** In May 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, the "motion to table (kill) the resolution (H Res 1209) that would declare the office of the Speaker of the House vacant." The vote was on the motion to table. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 359 to 43. \[House Vote 188, [5/8/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll188.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/8/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/188?19); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 1209](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/1209/all-actions)\]

-   **Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene Brought The Motion Following The Move By Speaker Johnson To Bring The Fiscal 2024 Appropriations And Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations To The Floor.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Greene, R-Ga., made her long-telegraphed move against Johnson after reading a lengthy litany of complaints about his tenure in office, which began in late October, on the floor. She offered her resolution (H Res 1209) to declare the office of the speaker vacant during a break in other legislative business. \[...\]Greene has said that Johnson is a 'Democrat speaker' and is particularly upset that Johnson brought to the floor compromise fiscal 2024 appropriations legislation (PL 118-42; PL 118-47) and a war supplemental package (PL 118-50) that included aid for Ukraine." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/8/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8005925?22)\]

-   **Greene Initially Introduced The Measure Weeks Ago And Trump Attempted To Dissuade Her.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Greene initially introduced the measure after the passage of the second of the two appropriations packages, leading to weeks of speculation of if and when she would make her move. But former President Donald Trump intervened and tried to persuade Greene to back down, according to reports, leading to speculation that the situation might be defused." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/8/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8005925?22)\]

-   **Greene And Representative Thomas Massie Met With Johnson To Negotiate, Which Johnson Refused To Do.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "It had appeared that Greene and her ally Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had put their effort on pause Tuesday, after meetings with Johnson on Monday and Tuesday in which they delivered four 'requests' to the speaker. They were joined by Arizona's Paul Gosar, the only other Republican to publicly back the effort. The trio is asking that Johnson only bring legislation to the floor that has the support of a majority of the conference; oppose any additional Ukraine aid; defund the office of special counsel Jack Smith; and include a 1 percent across-the-board spending cut in a continuing resolution that will be needed past Sept. 30 if all fiscal 2025 appropriations bills are not passed in time. Johnson, however, said he is not negotiating with Greene and her allies." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/8/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8005925?22)\]

-   **Democrats Protected Johnson From The Motion, Likely Due To His Willingness To Bring Foreign Aid To The Floor.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "But when Congress returned from its recess last week, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and his two deputies put speculation to rest by declaring they would vote to table Greene's motion to vacate. 'At this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction,' Jeffries, Whip Katherine M. Clark, D-Mass., and Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., said in their statement. \[...\] Johnson's decision to move funding for allies appears to have played a major role in Democrats' move to protect him. The speaker had stated he needed changes to the country's immigration and border enforcement laws to move Ukraine aid, but ended up bringing legislation to the floor without border provisions." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/8/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8005925?22)\]
