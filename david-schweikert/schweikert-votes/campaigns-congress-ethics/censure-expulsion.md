# Censure And Committee Expulsion

### Rep. Paul Gosar

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Censuring Representative Paul Gosar, And Removing Him From His Committee Assignments After He Posted An Edited Video Of Him Killing Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez And Assaulting President Biden.** In November 2021, Schweikert voted against a resolution which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "censure Rep. Paul Gosar R-Ariz., and remove him from his assignments on the House Oversight and Reform and Natural Resources committees for posting a manipulated video on his social media accounts depicting himself killing Rep. Ocasio-Cortez D-N.Y., and attacking President Joe Biden. It would require Gosar to present himself in the well of the House for the pronouncement of censure. The resolution would condemn 'threats of violence' against members of Congress and the president, stating that 'depictions of violence can foment actual violence and jeopardize the safety of elected officials.'" The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 223-207. \[House Vote 379, [11/17/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll379.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/17/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/379?5); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 789](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/789/actions)\]

-   **Representative Gosar Did Not Apologize For Posting The Animated Video, Claimed The Video Was Not Intended To A Target Representative Ocasio-Cortez Nor President Biden, But Instead Said His Cartoon Character Went After The "The Policy Monster Of Open Borders."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Gosar posted the video on social media Sunday, a move that led Pelosi to later call on the House Ethics Committee and law enforcement to investigate. In a Nov. 9 statement, Gosar did not apologize and said the video, which appeared on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, was mischaracterized. The posts have been removed. 'The cartoon depicts the symbolic nature of a battle between lawful and unlawful policies and in no way intended to be a targeted attack against Representative Cortez or Mr. Biden,' he said. 'It is a symbolic cartoon. It is not real life. Congressman Gosar cannot fly. The hero of the cartoon goes after the monster, the policy monster of open borders.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/12/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6390786?1)\]

-   **Representative Gosar Claimed The Animated Video Was Not Dangerous And Did Not Threaten Anyone, But Instead Illustrated A Battle On Policy Over Undocumented Immigrants.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "On the floor, Gosar said the video was not 'dangerous' or 'threatening' but depicted a 'policy battle' over 'illegal aliens.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/17/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6394853?2)\]

-   **Representative Gosar Claimed To Have Censured Himself By Taking Down The Animated Video, Not Because He Thought It Was Threatening But For The Sake Of Those Who Found The Video Offensive.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "'I do not espouse violence towards anyone. I never have. It was not my purpose to make anyone upset. I voluntarily took the cartoon down not because it was itself a threat, but because some thought it was. Out of compassion for those who generally felt offense, I self censored,' he added." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/17/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6394853?2)\]

-   **Representative Gosar Compared Himself To Alexander Hamilton, Who He Claimed Was The First Person The House Attempted To Censor.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Then he compared himself to one of the Founding Fathers: 'If I must join Alexander Hamilton, the first person attempted to be censored by this House, so be it. It is done.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/17/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6394853?2)\]

-   **Instead Of Apologizing For Uploading The Animated Video, Gosar Claimed It Was "Mischaracterized" And Was Not A Direct Attack Against Representative Ocasio-Cortez Nor President Biden.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Gosar has since removed the posts and taken down the video. He issued a statement on Nov. 9, but instead of apologizing said it was mischaracterized and 'in no way intended to be a targeted attack against Representative Cortez or Mr. Biden.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/17/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6394853?2)\]

**2021: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Censuring Representative Paul Gosar, And Removing Him From His Committee Assignments.** In November 2021, Schweikert effectively voted against a resolution which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for floor consideration of the resolution (H Res 789) censuring Rep. Gosar, R-Ariz. It would provide for one hour of debate on the resolution and provide for automatic adoption of a Deutch, D-Fla., manager\'s amendment that would remove Gosar from his assignments on the House Oversight and Reform and Natural Resources committees." The vote was on the adoption of the rule. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 222-208. \[House Vote 378, [11/17/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll378.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/17/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/378?4); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 789](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/789/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 795](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/795/actions)\]
