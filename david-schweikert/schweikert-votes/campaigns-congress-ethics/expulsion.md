The House rejected the motion by a vote of 311 to 114. \[House Vote 691, [11/1/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll691.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/1/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/691?16); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 878](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/878/all-actions)\]

-   **Previous Efforts To Expel Rep. Santos Failed Due To A Lack Of A Conviction.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Santos survived two previous pushes to expel him, relying on an argument that he had not been convicted and that due process was required. But the third time was the charm for detractors who said there was enough information to show he brought too much dishonor onto the chamber to remain in office." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/1/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7891087?21)\]

-   **Expulsion Of Rep. Santos Was Called For As A Result Of Lies About Employment, False Financial Disclosures, And criminal Charges.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "the resolution calls Santos to task for lying about his employment, filing false financial disclosure reports with the House and for the numerous criminal charges Santos faces. \[...\] Prosecutors say Santos filed fraudulent fundraising reports, repeatedly charged donors' credit cards without their permission, defrauded supporters by having them give money to a company under the guise that it would go to his campaign, when Santos spent thousands of those dollars on luxury designer clothes and other personal expenses. The 23 criminal counts also include a charge that he fraudulently obtained more than \$24,000 in unemployment benefits and lied on his House financial disclosure statements." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/26/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7864648?15)\]

-   **Congressman Santos Was Indicted On 13 Federal Criminal Charges, Including Wire Fraud, Money Laundering, Public Fund Theft, And Making False Statements, And He Voted To Refer The Resolution To The Ethics Panel.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Santos was indicted last week on 13 federal criminal charges, including wire fraud, money laundering, theft of public funds and making false statements to the House. He voted along with the rest of his party to refer the expulsion resolution to Ethics." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/17/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7745381?7)\]

-   **House Speaker Kevin McCarthy Originally Said That Congressman Santos Had The Right To Serve While His Indictment Cases Play Out But Would Ask Him To Resign If Convicted.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "When the charges were first announced, McCarthy said Santos has a right to serve while the Justice Department case against him plays out --- as other past members who were indicted have --- but that he would ask him to resign if he were convicted." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/17/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7745381?7)\]

-   **House Speaker Kevin McCarthy Said He Wanted The Ethics Committee To Move Quickly On The Expulsion Resolution Before The Justice Department Case Was Resolved.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Now McCarthy said he wants the Ethics Committee, which has the authority to recommend expulsion or other actions be taken against Santos, to move 'quickly,' ideally before the Justice Department case is resolved." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/17/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7745381?7)\]

**2023: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Directly Expelling Representative George Santos From The House Of Representatives.** In May 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the "motion to refer the resolution to the House Ethics Committee. The resolution would expel Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., from the House of Representatives." The vote was on a motion to refer. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 221 to 204, thus the resolution was referred to the House Ethics Committee. \[House Vote 217, [5/17/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll217.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/17/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/217?4); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 114](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/114/all-actions)\]

-   **The Motion Referred The Expulsion Resolution To A Panel Instead Of The House Holding A Direct Vote On The Resolution.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "In a 221-204 party-line vote, House Republicans supported Speaker Kevin McCarthy's decision to refer the expulsion resolution (H Res 114) to the committee instead of holding a direct vote on the matter." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/17/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7745381?7)\]

-   **The Ethics Committee Would Investigate Santos' Alleged Illegal Campaign Activities, Failures To Disclose Financial Information Or Violation To Conflicts Of Interest Laws As Well As Sexual Misconduct Towards A Person Who Was Seeking Employment In His Congressional Office.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The committee said it would be investigating whether Santos engaged in unlawful campaign activity, failed to disclose required financial information or violated federal conflict of interest laws --- matters the Justice Department also investigated. But the Ethics Committee is also investigating an allegation that Santos engaged in sexual misconduct towards an individual seeking employment in his congressional office, which goes beyond the scope of the DOJ probe." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/17/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7745381?7)\]

-   **Typically, The Ethics Committee Would Pause Investigations If The Justice Department Were Investigating A Member Until Proceedings Were Finished, So The Ethics Committee Moving Forward With The Resolution Would Disrupt Precedent.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Typically if the Justice Department is investigating a member the Ethics Committee would pause its own investigation until those proceedings conclude. McCarthy asking the Ethics Committee to move ahead of DOJ would flout that precedent, but he's admitted the decision is up to the committee." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/17/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7745381?7)\]
