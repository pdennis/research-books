# Disclaimers

### Information Distributed By Foreign Entities

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Would Require Disclaimers On Information Distributed By A Foreign Entity.** In March 2021, Schweikert voted against en bloc amendments no.4 to the For The People Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require conspicuous disclaimers when any informational material on an online platform is distributed on behalf of a foreign entity." The vote was on adoption of amendments. The House adopted the amendments by a vote of 223-208. \[House Vote 58, [3/3/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll058.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/3/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/58?44); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 23](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/117th-congress/house-amendment/23/actions?r=1&s=a); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1/actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr1%22%5D%7d&r=1&s=2)\]
