### Denouncing Socialist Policies

**2023: Schweikert Voted To Denounce Socialism And Socialist Policies.** In February 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for a resolution that would "state that Congress 'denounces socialism in all its forms, and opposes the implementation of socialist policies in the United States.' It would include findings that 'socialist ideology necessitates a concentration of power that has time and time again collapsed' into totalitarian regimes and led to widespread deaths and famine, and that the United States was 'founded on the belief in the sanctity of the individual' fundamentally opposed to the 'collectivistic system of socialism.'" The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 328 to 86, thus the resolution was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 106, [2/2/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll106.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/2/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/106?7); Congressional Actions, [H.Con.Res. 9](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/9/all-actions)\]

-   **The Resolution Claimed That Socialism Required Power Concentration That Leads To Communist Regimes, Totalitarianism, And Dictatorships, And Argued That Historical Crimes Were Committed By Socialist Ideologues.** According to The Hill, "The measure, which runs three pages, says 'socialist ideology necessitates a concentration of power that has time and time again collapsed into Communist regimes, totalitarian rule, and brutal dictatorships.' It argues that 'many of the greatest crimes in history were committed by socialist ideologues' --- mentioning Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, Pol Pot, Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un, Daniel Ortega, Hugo Chavez and Nicolás Maduro --- and it lists atrocities committed under socialist regimes." \[The Hill, [2/2/23](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3841636-house-passes-resolution-denouncing-socialism-vote-splits-democrats/#:~:text=The resolution overwhelmingly cleared the,and 14 voted )\]

-   **Several Democrats Voted Against The Resolution Because The Rules Committee Rejected An Amendment That Sought To Clarify That Opposition To Socialist Policies Would Not Include Federal Programs Such As Medicare And Social Security.** According to The Hill, "Several Democrats who voted against the resolution expressed concerns regarding the future of Social Security and Medicare. They noted that Republicans on the Rules Committee rejected an amendment proposed by Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) which sought to clarify that opposition to the implementation of socialist policies in the U.S. does not include federal programs like Medicare and Social Security." \[The Hill, [2/2/23](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3841636-house-passes-resolution-denouncing-socialism-vote-splits-democrats/#:~:text=The resolution overwhelmingly cleared the,and 14 voted )\]
