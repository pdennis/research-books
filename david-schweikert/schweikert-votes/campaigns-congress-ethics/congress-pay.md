# Congressional Pay

**2018: Schweikert Voted Against The \$1.3 Trillion FY 2018 Omnibus Spending Deal Which Raised Spending By \$138 Billion Over FY 2017 Levels; Legislation Also Continued The Freeze On Congressional Pay.** In March 2018, Schweikert voted against the FY 2018 Omnibus spending bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Combined, the spending measures would provide about \$1.3 trillion in discretionary spending, with \$1.2 trillion subject to discretionary spending caps, and \$78.1 billion designated as Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The measure\'s spending levels are consistent with the increased defense and non-defense budget caps set by the two-year budget deal agreed to last month. That agreement increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80 billion and the non-defense cap by \$63 billion. Given that the previous caps were set to reduce overall discretionary spending by \$5 billion, the net increase provided by the omnibus is \$138 billion over the FY 2017 level." The vote was on the motion to concur in the Senate Amendment with an Amendment. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 256 to 167. The Senate later agreed to the legislation, sending it to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 127, [3/22/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll127.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/22/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5287294?5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1625](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1625/all-actions)\]

It would not affect an authorized increase in military pay." The House passed the bill by a vote of 261 to 154. Subsequently, the bill was sent to the Senate, which, as of December, 2013, had not taken any substantive action on it. \[House Vote 44, [2/15/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll044.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/11/13](http://cq.com/doc/har-4217872/6); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 273](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/273/all-actions)\]
