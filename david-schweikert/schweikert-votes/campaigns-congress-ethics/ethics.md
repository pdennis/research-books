### Federal Ethics Rules

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Setting Federal Ethics Rules For All Branches Of Government, And Against Prohibiting Congressional Members And Staff From Furthering Financial Interests, Sitting On For-Profit Boards, Or Using Taxpayer Money To Settle Employment Discrimination Lawsuits Against Them.** In March 2021, Schweikert voted against the For The People Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "set or modify a number of federal ethics rules governing all three branches of government. It would formally prohibit members of Congress and congressional staff from using their positions to further their financial interests and prohibit members from serving on the board of a for-profit entity or using federal funds to settle employment discrimination cases brought against them." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 220-210. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 62, [3/3/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll062.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/3/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/62?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1/actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr1%22%5D%7d&r=1&s=2)\]

It also would establish an ethical code of conduct for Supreme Court justices and require presidential and vice presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/25/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6137568?7)\]
