-   **The Amendment Came As Representative James Comer Launched A Probe Into NewsGuard's Impact On First Amendment Speech, Citing A Potential For Censorship, And Whether The Organization Was Sponsored In Any Way By The Government.** According to the Hill, "House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) announced Thursday he is launching a probe into a news-rating system that seeks to guard against misinformation by scoring news and information sites based on their reliability, trustworthiness and financial conflict of interest. Comer said the probe will focus on 'the impact of NewsGuard on protected First Amendment speech and its potential to serve as a non-transparent agent of censorship campaigns.' \[...\] 'The Committee seeks to make an independent determination about whether NewsGuard's intervention on protected speech has been in any way sponsored by a federal, state, local, or foreign government,' Comer wrote in his letter." \[The Hill, [6/13/24](https://thehill.com/media/4721552-newsguard-probe-oversight-committee/)\]
