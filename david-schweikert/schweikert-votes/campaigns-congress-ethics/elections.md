It would authorize \$1.3 billion through fiscal 2026 for U.S. Election Assistance Commission grants for states to update voting systems in accordance with the bill\'s provisions, including for cybersecurity risk mitigation and to conduct post-election audits. Among other provisions, it would require states to use voting system hardware and software manufactured in the U.S., require that such systems are tested by the Commission at least nine months before a general federal election, and establish certain disclosure and cybersecurity incident reporting requirements for vendors of voting system equipment.

But they spoke out against the bill, calling it federal overreach into elections, which are managed by states and localities. 'Democrats' bill focuses on forcing states to restructure their election systems through federal mandates and ignores states' rights to choose the election system that best fits their unique needs," said Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill, the ranking Republican on the Administration Committee \[...\] So far, McConnell has refused to allow votes on any election security proposals, citing concerns that the measures would erode state authority over elections." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/27/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5583072?1)\]
