### Preventing Taxpayer Funding For First Class Tickets And Corporate Jet Leases For Members Of Congress

**2014: Schweikert Voted Against The Democratic Substitute FY 2015 Budget Resolution Which Would Have Prevented Funding For First Class Tickets And Corporate Jet Leases For Members Of Congress.** In April 2014, Schweikert voted against the Democratic FY 2015 substitute budget resolution. According to the text of the amendment, "The Committee on House Administration shall review the policies pertaining to the services provided to Members of Congress and House Committees, and shall identify ways to reduce any subsidies paid for the operation of the House gym, Barbershop, Salon, and the House dining room. Further, it is the policy of this resolution that no taxpayer funds may be used to purchase first class airfare or to lease corporate jets for Members of Congress." According to Congressional Quarterly, the overall resolution would "provide for \$3.078 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2015, not including off-budget accounts. The plan would call for repealing the sequester, including cuts to Medicare. It also would propose eliminating the non-defense discretionary sequester starting in 2016." The vote was on the substitute amendment to the FY 2015 Ryan budget. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 163 to 261. \[House Vote 176, [4/10/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll176.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/10/14](http://cq.com/vote/2014/H/176?0); Congressional Record, [4/10/14](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2014/04/10/CREC-2014-04-10-pt1-PgH3164-2.pdf); Congressional Actions, [H.
