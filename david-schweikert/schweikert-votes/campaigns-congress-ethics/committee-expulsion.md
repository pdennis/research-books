# Committee Expulsion

### Rep. Eric Swalwell

The vote was on a motion to table the resolution. The House adopted the motion by a vote of 218-200, thus killing the resolution. \[House Vote 94, [3/18/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll094.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/18/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/94?7); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 243](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/243/actions)\]

-   **Instead Of Holding Rep. Greene Accountable For Spreading QAnon Conspiracy Theories, "Making Racist, Anti-Semitic And Islamophobic Comments," And Promoting Violence Against Other Congressional Members, Greene Was Appointed To High-Profile Committee Posts.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Democrats argued Wednesday that Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy rewarded Greene with high-profile committee posts, rather than hold her accountable for pushing false QAnon conspiracy theories, making racist, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic comments and elevating calls for violence against members of Congress." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/3/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6113521?20)\]

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib; mused that a space laser aligned with Jewish financial interests caused devastating wildfires in California; and aligned herself with QAnon, a baseless belief about an anti-Trump 'deep state' that engages in child sex trafficking and Satanism." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/4/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6116312?21)\]

-   **Green Apologized In A Closed Meeting Of House Republicans And Received A Standing Ovation.** According to Vox, "In a closed meeting of House Republicans Tuesday night, Greene privately apologized for how her statements may have hurt fellow Republicans, stating that 9/11 and school shootings did happen and saying she embraced QAnon during a dark period of her life but has since moved forward. In a display of just how embedded she is in the House GOP, she received a standing ovation." \[Vox, [2/4/21](https://www.vox.com/22266469/marjorie-taylor-greene-mccarthy-hoyer-mcgovern-house-vote)\]

Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) began creating the resolution to expel Greene from committees. His promise to meet with her was insufficient for House Democrats. On Monday, Hoyer gave McCarthy 72 hours to strip Greene of her committee assignments --- as Republican leadership had eventually done with former Rep. Steve King for repeated white supremacist comments. McCarthy called Hoyer with a counteroffer: He would move Greene from the Education Committee to a different committee if Democrats agreed to drop the resolution. Hoyer said no, and the Rules Committee moved forward with the resolution, voting to bring it to the floor." \[Vox, [2/4/21](https://www.vox.com/22266469/marjorie-taylor-greene-mccarthy-hoyer-mcgovern-house-vote)\]
