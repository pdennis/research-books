### Spending At Trump Organization Hotels

**2020: Schweikert Voted For An Amendment To The FY 2020 Minibus Spending Bill That Prohibited The State Department From Spending Money At Hotels And Golf Resorts Affiliated With The Trump Organization.** In June 2019, Schweikert voted for an amendment to the FY 2020 minibus appropriations bill, which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit the use of funds made available by the bill for a number of purposes, including to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty, to enter into contracts and agreements with business entities connected to President Donald Trump, or to provide military education and training to the government of Saudi Arabia. It would also make adjustments to a number of funds related to nonproliferation and anti-terrorism, international economic assistance, and foreign development." The vote was on adoption. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 231-187, but the related bill was never taken up in the Senate. \[House Vote 332, [6/19/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll332.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/19/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/332?30); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt.348](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/116th-congress/house-amendment/348/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R.2740](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2740/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+2740%22%5D%7d&s=1&r=1)\]

-   **The FY 2020 Minibus Prohibited The State Department From Spending Money At Hotels And Golf Resorts Affiliated With The Trump Organization, Which Cost Taxpayers \$80,000 Since 2017.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "House Democrats offered another rebuke to Trump \[...\] by voting to block the State Department from spending taxpayers\' money at his domestic and overseas golf clubs and hotels. The House voted 231-187 to adopt an amendment that would prohibit the department from spending funds at any of the Trump Organization\'s hundreds of hotels, golf resorts and other properties \[...\] The department since 2017 has paid nearly \$80,000 to properties owned, managed or branded by the president's private company, The Trump Organization, according to data tabulated by the investigative news site ProPublica. The tab for American taxpayers includes a nearly \$11,000 payment to the president's golf club in Doonbeg, Ireland. ProPublica said it was not clear when that specific payment was made." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/19/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5571626?10)\]
