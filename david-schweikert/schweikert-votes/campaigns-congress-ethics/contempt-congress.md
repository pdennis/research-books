# Contempt Of Congress

### Attorney General Merrick Garland

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Hold Attorney General Merrick Garland In Contempt Of Congress For "Failure To Comply" With A Subpoena For Recordings Of Special Counsel Robert Hur's Interview With President Biden.** In June 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the resolution that would find Attorney General Merrick B. Garland in contempt of Congress for failure to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee for audio recordings of former special counsel Robert K. Hur\'s interviews with President Joe Biden and a ghostwriter who worked with Biden. It would direct the speaker of the House to 'take all appropriate action to enforce the subpoena' and certify the committee report (H Rept 118-527) accompanying the contempt resolution to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia so that Garland may 'be proceeded against in the manner and form provided by law.'" The vote was on passage. The House adopted the resolution by a vote of 216 to 207. \[House Vote 260, [6/12/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll260.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/12/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/260?11); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 1293](http://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/1293/all-actions)\]

-   **The Vote To Hold Garland In Contempt Came After President Biden Asserted Executive Privilege Over The Recordings That Were Obtained During An Investigation Into President Biden's Handling Of Classified Documents And Sought By Republicans For Their Impeachment Inquiry.** According to CBS News, "GOP lawmakers are seeking audio recordings of President Biden\'s interview with special counsel Robert Hur concerning the president\'s handling of classified documents, which came as part of an investigation that wrapped earlier this year. The House Judiciary and Oversight committees demanded that the Justice Department provide the tapes as part of their impeachment inquiry into the president. But the president asserted executive privilege over the recordings in May. That didn\'t stop House Republicans from voting to hold Garland in contempt of Congress for the refusal to hand over the recordings in a vote earlier this month." \[CBS News, [6/26/24](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/merrick-garland-subpoena-house-republicans-inherent-contempt/)\]

-   **A Transcript Of The Interview Was Made Available, However, Republicans Argued The Audio Recordings Were Necessary To Confirm The Transcript.** According to the Hill, "Although House impeachment investigators claimed it could prove useful for their impeachment investigation, they already have the transcript of the conversation, which shows their lines of inquiry were not discussed." \[Hill, [6/12/24](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4718888-dave-joyce-merrick-garland-contempt/)\]

-   **Garland Argued That Handing Over The Tapes Would Impact Cooperation From Witnesses That Do Not Want Conversations Shared With Congress.** According to the Hill, "Garland resisted turning over the tapes, arguing it could harm the Justice Department's ability to score cooperation from witnesses who may not want their conversations shared with Congress." \[Hill, [6/12/24](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4718888-dave-joyce-merrick-garland-contempt/)\]
