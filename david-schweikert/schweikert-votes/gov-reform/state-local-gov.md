# State And Local Government

### Special Districts

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Extend Grant Access To Special Districts.** In May 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, the "motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill that would require the Office of Management and Budget, within 180 days of the bill's enactment, to issue guidance to agencies that would clarify how federal agencies recognize a unit of local government that is eligible to receive federal financial assistance. The bill defines a special district as a political subdivision of a state, with specified boundaries and significant budgetary autonomy or control, created by or pursuant to the laws of the state, for the purpose of performing limited and specific governmental or proprietary functions that distinguish it as a significantly separate entity from the administrative governance structure of any other form of local government unit within a state. The bill would require each federal agency to implement the guidance within one year after the date OMB issues the guidance. It also would require OMB to report to Congress, within two years of the bill's enactment, on the implementation of the guidance." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 352 to 27. \[House Vote 178, [5/6/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll178.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/6/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/178?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7525](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7525/all-actions)\]
