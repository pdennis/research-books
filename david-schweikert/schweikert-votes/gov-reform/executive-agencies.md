### Office Utilization

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Require 60 Percent Utilization Of Federal Buildings.** In March 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "he bill, as amended, that would that would require the General Services Administration, in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget, to establish standard methodologies and identify technologies available for measuring occupancy in public buildings and federally leased space within 60 days of the bill\'s enactment. The bill would require the heads of federal agencies to work with the GSA to identify, deploy and use sensors and other technologies in public buildings and federally leased space to measure their occupancy within 180 days of the measure's enactment. It would direct the OMB, in consultation with GSA, to ensure building utilization is at least 60 percent on average over each one-year period, beginning one year after the bill\'s enactment and annually thereafter. It also would require the OMB to submit a plan to Congress and the Government Accountability Office to consolidate department and agency headquarters buildings in the National Capital Region which will result in building utilization of over 60 percent within one year of the bill\'s enactment, and implement the plan one year after its submission. As amended, it would define 'occupancy' to include the total number of employees actually performing duties in person in a public building or federally-leased space 40 hours per week. It also would require the GSA to protect personally identifiable information when using any sensors under the bill to determine building occupancy." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 217 to 203. \[House Vote 84, [3/12/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll084.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/12/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/84?21); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 6276](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6276/all-actions)\]
