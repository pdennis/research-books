### Outsourcing

**2014: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Barring Companies That Used To Be Incorporated In The U.S., But Were Now Incorporated In Bermuda Or The Cayman Islands, From Receiving U.S. Government Contracts.** In September 2014, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment that included a provision that, according to Congressional Quarterly's description of an earlier amendment with substantively identical language, "would bar the use of funds provided in the \[underlying\] bill for awarding contracts to corporations chartered or incorporated in Bermuda or the Cayman Islands that were previously incorporated in the United States." The rest of the amendment, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would \[have\] extend\[ed\] the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank for 5 years, and include\[d\] the text of a measure (HR 377) to tighten prohibitions on pay discrimination based on sex. It would \[have\] include\[d\] the text of a measure (HR 1010) that would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to \$8.20 an hour, \$9.15 an hour after one year, and \$10.10 an hour after two years. It would also allow student loan debt to be refinanced at rates available to current borrowers." The underlying bill funded the government through December 11, 2014; it also included a provision reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank through June 30, 2015. The proposed amendment stated that the minimum wage, equal pay and student loan provisions would be effective only through December 11, 2014. The vote was on a motion to recommit the bill and report it back with the specified amendment; the House rejected the motion by a vote of 199 to 228. \[House Vote 508, [9/17/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll508.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/17/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/508); Congressional Quarterly, [7/10/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/387); H.J.Res. 124, [9/17/14](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-joint-resolution/124/text/172250); Congressional Record, [7/10/14](https://beta.congress.gov/crec/2014/07/10/CREC-2014-07-10-pt1-PgH6049-2.pdf#page=2); Congressional Record, [9/17/14](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2014/09/17/CREC-2014-09-17-pt1-PgH7637.pdf#page=24); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Backer Of Similar Amendment Had Argued That Companies That Claimed To Be American When Receiving Federal Contracts Should Not Get To Claim Differently When Paying Taxes.** According to the Congressional Record, when the House considered a similar amendment in July 2014 that would have had applied only to the Energy Department, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), the sponsor of that amendment, said, "My amendment would prohibit Federal contracts issued by agencies under the jurisdiction of this bill from going to entities incorporated in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, the two nations most often abused as tax havens. This body has accepted similar provisions for the Departments of Defense, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development. As before, we should not spend taxpayer money on Federal contracts that go to companies that have renounced their American citizenship in favor of an island tax haven. Just this week, Business Week wrote an article examining the loopholes that longstanding American companies like Ingersol Rand, which was founded in Connecticut in 1871, have been exploiting in order to enjoy lucrative government contracts while pretending to reside overseas for tax purposes. \[...\] These firms simply should not be allowed to pretend they are an American company when it comes time to get contracts, then claim to be an offshore company when the tax bill arrives." \[Congressional Record, [7/10/14](https://beta.congress.gov/crec/2014/07/10/CREC-2014-07-10-pt1-PgH6049-2.pdf#page=2)\]
