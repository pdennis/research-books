The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 127 to 279. \[House Vote 274, [6/9/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll274.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/9/14](http://cq.com/vote/2014/H/274?0); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 787](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/787/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4745](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4745/all-actions/)\]

### Funding

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2020 Minibus Appropriations Bill, Which Provided \$23.9 Billion For Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance.** In December 2019, Schweikert voted against the FY 2020 minibus spending bill According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill "eases funding for Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance, appropriating \$23.9 billion --- \$1.3 billion more than FY 2019 and \$1.6 billion more than requested. It rejects the administration\'s proposal to eliminate the Public Housing Capital Fund, instead providing \$2.9 billion (\$95 million more than FY 2019). The Public Housing Operating Fund would receive \$4.5 billion, \$104 million less than FY 2019." The vote was a motion to concur in the Senate amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 297-120. The Senate later passed the bill and the President signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 689, [12/17/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll689.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/17/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/689?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R.1865](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1865/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+1865%22%5D%7d&s=4&r=1)\]

**2018: Schweikert Voted Against The \$1.3 Trillion FY 2018 Omnibus Spending Deal Which Raised Spending By \$138 Billion Over FY 2017 Levels, Including A \$1.7 Billion Increase In Section 8 Rental Assistance.** In March 2018, Schweikert voted against the FY 2018 Omnibus spending bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Combined, the spending measures would provide about \$1.3 trillion in discretionary spending, with \$1.2 trillion subject to discretionary spending caps, and \$78.1 billion designated as Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The measure\'s spending levels are consistent with the increased defense and non-defense budget caps set by the two-year budget deal agreed to last month. That agreement increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80 billion and the non-defense cap by \$63 billion. Given that the previous caps were set to reduce overall discretionary spending by \$5 billion, the net increase provided by the omnibus is \$138 billion over the FY 2017 level."

-   **Omnibus Appropriated An Eight Percent Increase In Section 8 Funding.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The agreement provides \$22.0 billion --- \$1.7 billion (8%) more than 2017 funding and \$2.7 billion (14%) more than requested --- for rental assistance under the Section 8 program, through which housing vouchers are provided by public housing authorities to low-income individuals and families. The total for Section 8 vouchers includes \$4 billion in advance appropriations included in last year's spending measure; the agreement provides a similar \$4 billion advance appropriation for FY 2019." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/22/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5287294?5)\]
