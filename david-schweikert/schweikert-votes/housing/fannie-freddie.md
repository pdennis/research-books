### Privatization

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Eliminate Fannie Mae And Freddie Mac, As Part Of Rep. Paul Ryan's Budget Proposal.** In April 2014, Schweikert voted for House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's (R-WI) proposed budget resolution covering fiscal years 2015 to 2024, which, according to the House Budget Committee's Fiscal Year 2015 "Path to Prosperity," "Privatize the Business of Government-Controlled Mortgage Giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \[...\] Since Treasury stepped in to provide additional bailout funds, Fannie and Freddie's dominance in the mortgage market has grown. In 2013, the GSEs accounted for 60 percent of first-lien mortgage originations, with FHA and VA backing an additional 19 percent. In 2005 and 2006, the GSE's share of first-lien originations was closer to 30 percent. Additionally, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae now dominate the market for the issuance of new single-family, mortgage-backed securities with a combined 99 percent market share. This budget recommends putting an end to corporate subsidies and taxpayer bailouts in housing finance. It envisions the eventual elimination of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, winding down their government guarantee and ending taxpayer subsidies. In the interim, this resolution envisions removing distortions to allow an influx of private capital and advancing various measures that would bring transparency and accountability to these two government-sponsored enterprises, which could include measures described in H.R. 2767, the Protecting American Taxpayers and Homeowners Act of 2013." The House adopted the budget resolution by a vote of 219 to 205, but the Senate did not. \[House Vote 177, [4/10/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll177.xml); House Budget Committee, [4/1/14](http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fy15_blueprint.pdf#page=41); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Fannie Mae And Freddie Mac Were Formed By The U.S. Government To Support Lending For Homebuyers.** According to the New York Times, "Fannie Mae was created as the Federal National Mortgage Association in 1938, under President Franklin Roosevelt, to ensure that mortgage lenders had sufficient money to lend to home buyers during the Depression. It has been a private corporation since 1968. Freddie Mac, which was formed as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, is also privately held. It was formed by Congress in 1970 to support homeownership and rental housing." \[New York Times, [7/12/08](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/12/business/12q-a.html?ref=freddiemac&_r=0)\]

-   **Fannie Mae And Freddy Mac Buy Mortgages From Banks Using Low Interest Funds, Leading To A Combined Guarantee Of Approximately Half Of The U.S. Mortgage Market.** According to the New York Times, "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac borrow money from debt markets, usually at a rate that's much lower than for other banks, and use that money to buy mortgages from banks. Then they either hold the mortgages in investment portfolios or resell them to investors as mortgage-backed securities. \[...\] Together, they own or guarantee about half of the nation's \$12 trillion mortgage market." \[New York Times, [7/12/08](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/12/business/12q-a.html?ref=freddiemac&_r=0)\]

-   **The Federal Government Created The Federal Housing Finance Agency Due To The 2008 Financial Crisis And Empowered The Agency To Take Over Fannie Mae And Freddie Mac; A Month Later, The Agency Did So.** According to the Congressional Research Service, "The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289), enacted July 30, 2008, provides the authority for the government's takeover of the GSEs. The act created a new GSE regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), with the authority to take control of either GSE to restore it to a sound financial condition. \[...\] On September 7, 2008, the FHFA established a conservatorship for Fannie and Freddie. As conservator, the FHFA has taken over the assets and assumed all the powers of the shareholders, directors, and officers. It may take any necessary action to restore the firms to a sound and solvent condition. Stockholders' voting rights are suspended during the conservatorship, and both firms' CEOs have been replaced. Dividends on common and preferred stock have been suspended, although the shares continue to trade. GSE business operations will continue as before; the conservator will delegate authority to the companies' new management to move forward. The conservatorship will end when the FHFA finds that a safe and solvent condition has been restored." \[CRS Report #RS22950, [9/15/08](http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/110097.pdf)\]
