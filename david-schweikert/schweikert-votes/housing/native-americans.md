### Reauthorizing Native American And Native Hawaiian Housing Programs Through FY 2019

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Reauthorize Native American And Native Hawaiian Housing Programs Through FY 2019.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted for reauthorizing several housing programs for Native Americans and Native Hawaiians. The legislation would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "reauthorize\[d\] a number of Indian and Native Hawaiian housing programs through fiscal year 2019. The measure would \[have\] annually authorize\[d\]: \$650 million for the Indian Housing Block Grant Program, \$12 million for costs to guarantee up to \$976 million in loans for Indian housing, \$13 million for direct housing assistance under the Native Hawaiian Homeownership Act (PL 106-569), and \$386,000 for costs to guarantee a up to \$42 million in loans under that law." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House passed the legislation by a vote of 297 to 98. The Senate took no substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 130, [3/23/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll130.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/23/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/130?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 360](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/360/all-actions)\]
