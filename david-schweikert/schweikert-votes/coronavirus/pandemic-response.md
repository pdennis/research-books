# Pandemic Response

### Coronavirus Stimulus Package

**2020: Schweikert Voted Against The Heroes Act To Appropriate An Additional \$3 Trillion In Coronavirus Recovery Funds.** In May 2020, Schweikert voted against the Heroes Act that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "Passage of the bill, as amended, that would provide roughly \$3 trillion in funding to further address the health and economic effects of COVID-19, including almost \$1 trillion for direct aid to state and local governments; \$200 billion for a fund to provide hazard pay for essential workers; \$75 billion for a national testing program; and funding for state and federal response related to health care, education, housing, and food supply. It would extend federal funding of expanded unemployment compensation benefits through January 2021 and provide an additional round of tax rebates of \$1,200 for individuals with incomes of \$75,000 or less. The bill would provide \$540 billion for states, territories, and tribal governments and \$375 billion for local governments to address costs and economic impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 208-199. \[House Vote 109, [5/15/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll109.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/15/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/109?6); Congressional Actions, [H.R.6800](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6800/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+6800%22%5D%7d&s=1&r=1)\]

-   **The \$3 Trillion Aid Package Included Dozens Of Democratic Priorities, Causing The White House To Issue A Veto Threat.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Speaker Nancy Pelosi muscled a \$3 trillion aid package through the House late Friday, overcoming defections from her party\'s moderate wing who would have preferred to vote for a bipartisan measure \[...\] The bill includes dozens of key Democratic priorities and has elicited sharp criticism from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who on Thursday called the 1,815-page package a 'liberal wish list.' The White House issued a veto threat on the measure." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/15/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5908790?1)\]

-   **Moderate Democrats Voted Against The Bill Citing Issues With The Partisan Nature Of The Bill.** Among the Democrats who announced in advance they\'d vote against the package were \[...\] Joe Cunningham \[...\] All are moderates in GOP-leaning districts. 'I think it's something that should have had more broad bipartisan support," said Cunningham. He argued that aid legislation 'needs to be more narrowly focused on the people who are suffering as a result of the pandemic.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/15/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5908790?1)\]

-   **Progressive Caucus Co-Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal Voted Against The Bill, Stating That It Didn't Go Far Enough To Help Workers And Businesses.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chairwoman Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was the sole member of the party's more liberal wing to vote against the bill. She told reporters the measure didn't go far enough to help workers and businesses. 'At the end of the day, what I'm talking about is protecting the economy and protecting people from dying, because businesses and workers feel too much pressure to go back to work too quickly because they don't have money,' said Jayapal." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/15/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5908790?1)\]

-   **The Bill Included \$1 Trillion In Aid To Local And State Governments.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill includes nearly \$1 trillion in aid to local and state governments, which are facing steep budget shortfalls following a drop off in income tax revenue due to skyrocketing unemployment, as well as a reduction in sales tax revenue after businesses mostly shut down due to stay-at-home orders." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/15/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5908790?1)\]

-   **The Bill Provided \$435 Billion In A Second Round Of Direct Payments To Households.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill would provide \$435 billion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, to send out more direct payments to households and fill in gaps from the previous round, estimated in March to cost \$294 billion. Families with adult children who are full-time students up to age 24 could now receive \$500 from the previous round, which had cut off age at 17; the age limit would be raised for the new round as well, and up to three children per household would be eligible for the full \$1,200 amount allotted to adults. It would also make individuals with a taxpayer identification number eligible for payments, even if they don't have a Social Security number. Critics said that would open the door to undocumented immigrants getting payments, and Republicans were nearly successful on a procedural vote to strip that provision." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/15/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5908790?1)\]

-   **The Bill Provided \$200 Billion In Grants For Employers To Increase Pay For Essential Workers.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The legislation would also establish a nearly \$200 billion grant program for employers to provide a pay increase for 'essential workers,' such as first responders and employees at hospitals, grocery stores and meat processing plants." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/15/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5908790?1)\]

-   **The Bill Extended Expanded Unemployment Insurance Benefits Despite Republican Opposition.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "And expanded unemployment insurance benefits worth an extra \$600 per week on top of regular state allotments would be extended from August through the end of January, and through March if regular state eligibility hadn't been used up yet. Many Republicans oppose the higher weekly benefit because in many states it would pay unemployed workers more than they made before they were laid off, which they say will cripple firm's ability to reopen once lockdowns are lifted." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/15/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5908790?1)\]

-   **A Bipartisan Measure Increased The Employee Retention Tax Credit For Employers To Cover Employees Wages.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "One bipartisan proposal would beef up a tax credit in the March law to cover up to \$5,000 of wages for employers experiencing sharp revenue declines. The House Democrats\' bill would expand that provision to cover up to \$36,000 of wages, as well as making employer health benefit expenses eligible, in line with recent Treasury guidance. The JCT said the so-called 'employee retention credit' expansion would cost \$164 billion over a decade." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/15/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5908790?1)\]

-   **The Bill Included A Measure Eliminating The SALT Tax Cap, A Long-Sought After Democratic Provision.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Another costly tax provision doesn\'t enjoy the same bipartisan support, however: eliminating the \$10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions for this year and next, at a \$137 billion cost. Republicans have mostly spent the last few days blasting the 'SALT' cap removal as a sop to richer households in blue states that has nothing to do with pandemic relief." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/15/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5908790?1)\]

-   **The HEROES Act Provided \$25 Billion In Emergency Funding To The Postal Service.** According to the Federal News Network, "The spending bill would give the Postal Service \$25 billion in emergency funding that would last through September 2022 \[...\] The bill would also modify language in the \$2 trillion CARES Act that would streamline the Postal Services' ability to borrow \$10 billion in an expanded line of credit from the Treasury Department." \[Federal News Network, [5/13/20](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/congress/2020/05/latest-pandemic-spending-bill-grants-ig-protections-usps-funding-2020-census-extensions/)\]

-   **CBPP: The COVID-19 Pandemic Caused State Funds To Dramatically Decrease, And The Heroes Act Would Provide \$500 Billion To States and \$40 Million To Tribes And Territories.** According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), "States depend primarily on sales and income tax revenues to fund schools, health care, and other services. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused these revenues to collapse, since businesses are closed and many people have been laid off. Further, the economic crisis is expected to last long after the health crisis ends \[...\] As a result, states face massive budget shortfalls of about \$765 billion for the current fiscal year (which ends June 30 in most states) and the next two. Even after subtracting flexible federal aid provided so far and the entire amount in state rainy day funds, states still face shortfalls of about \$600 billion. Further, these shortfall estimates do not include increased state costs due to the pandemic, such as increased costs for public hospitals, first responders, domestic abuse agencies, mental health departments, and others \[...\] Under the Heroes Act, states would receive \$500 billion; another \$20 billion would go to tribes and another \$20 billion to the territories." \[CBPP, [5/20/20](https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/how-much-would-each-state-receive-through-the-coronavirus-state-fiscal)\]

### Emergency Funding

**2020: Schweikert Voted For An \$8.3 Billion Emergency Funding Bill To Combat The Spread Of Coronavirus.** In March 2020, Schweikert voted for a bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide \$7.8 billion in supplemental fiscal 2020 appropriations to federal departments and agencies for activities to prevent, prepare and respond to the threat of COVID-19 domestically and abroad, including \$6.5 billion for the Health and Human Services Department. Within the total amount, it would provide \$3.1 billion for the HHS Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, including for the development and purchase of vaccines and other medical supplies, with an additional \$300 million available for the purchase of medical supplies, if necessary. It would provide \$2.2 billion for the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, including \$950 million for state and local preparedness grants and \$300 million for global response activities. It would provide \$986 million for U.S. Agency for International Development bilateral economic assistance related to coronavirus response, including through contributions to international organizations. It would also provide \$836 million for the National Institute of Health, \$264 million for State Department diplomatic programs, \$61 million for the Food and Drug Administration, and \$20 million for the Small Business Administration disaster loan program, for expenses related to coronavirus response. The bill would also authorize the Health and Human Services Department to temporarily waive or modify certain Medicare reimbursement rules for in-home health care, to provide for coverage of telehealth services for individuals in a declared emergency area. Such waivers would increase mandatory federal spending for Medicare by approximately \$490 million through fiscal 2022." The vote was on passage. The House approved the bill by a vote of 415-2. \[House Vote 86, [3/4/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll086.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/4/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/86?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R.6074](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6074/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%22hr+6074%22%7d)\]

-   **The Emergency Coronavirus Spending Bill Provides \$7.76 Billion To Federal Agencies And \$500 Million In Medicare Waivers.** According to The Hill, "The bill provides \$7.76 billion to agencies combating the coronavirus, It also authorizes another \$500 million in waivers for Medicare telehealth restrictions, bringing the total figure greenlighted under the bill up to \$8.3 billion." \[The Hill, [3/5/20](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/486147-senate-passes-83-billion-coronavirus-bill-sending-it-to-trump)\]

-   **The Trump Administration Originally Requested Only \$2.25 Billion To Combat Coronavirus, Far Below What Was Awarded In The Final Bill.** According to The Hill, "The Trump administration sent its emergency request to Congress on Feb. 24, less than two weeks ago. The initial \$2.5 billion amount, only half of which would have been new funding, was criticized by Democrats and some Republicans as being too low." \[The Hill, [3/5/20](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/486147-senate-passes-83-billion-coronavirus-bill-sending-it-to-trump)\]

-   **Republicans Rejected A Democratic Push To Ensure Vaccines And Treatments Developed By Private Companies Be Priced Affordably.** According to The Hill, "Democrats had pushed for language in the bill that would require any coronavirus vaccines or treatments developed by private companies with federal funding to be priced affordably. But Republicans had argued that could discourage drug companies from investing in potential cures and vaccines. A source told the Hill that there was also discussion at a leadership level about ensuring Medicare would fully cover copay for a vaccine, but the idea was rejected by Republicans." \[The Hill, [3/5/20](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/486147-senate-passes-83-billion-coronavirus-bill-sending-it-to-trump)\]

### Families First Coronavirus Response Act

**2020: Schweikert Voted For The \$3.5 Billion Families First Coronavirus Response Act.** In March 2020, Schweikert voted for the Families First Coronavirus Response Act that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "appropriate approximately \$3.5 billion in supplemental funding and authorize additional funding to support the federal response to the spread and economic effects of COVID-19, including for paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, diagnostic testing, and nutritional assistance. Among other provisions, the bill would require health plans to cover diagnostic tests for COVID-19 and provide \$1 billion for the Health and Human Services Department to reimburse laboratories for testing of uninsured individuals \[...\] It would provide \$1 billion for Labor Dept emergency grants to states related to unemployment insurance and provide full federal funding for extended unemployment insurance in states with an unemployment rate increase of 10% or more. It would provide \$1.3 billion for Agriculture and Health and Human Services Department nutrition assistance programs, including for family nutrition programs, grants to U.S. territories, and services for low-income and elderly individuals. It would provide for temporary emergency procedures to provide nutrition assistance for participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and to students affected by school closures. It would require employers with fewer than 500 employees and government employers to grant an additional 80 hours of paid sick leave for individuals affected by the coronavirus, including to care for dependents due to illness or school closures \[...\] It would also require such employers to provide 12 weeks of job-protected family or medical leave for affected employees during a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and to provide paid leave after 14 days, at a rate of at least two-thirds an employee\'s regular rate of pay. It would provide tax credits for employers equal to the full amount of sick leave wages paid in any calendar quarter, capped at \$511 per day for each employee who is ill, quarantined, or seeking treatment, or \$200 per day for each employee who is caring for a family member. It would provide tax credits for employers equal to the full amount of family leave wages paid in any calendar quarter, capped at \$200 per day and \$10,000 per quarter for each employee.

Now with the administration's budget proposal expected this week, a slew of life-saving policies modeled after Hyde could also be on the chopping block." \[Marjorie Dannenfelser Op-Ed − Roll Call, [5/25/21](https://rollcall.com/2021/05/25/these-pro-life-amendments-could-be-on-the-biden-budget-chopping-block/)\]

**2020: Schweikert Voted Against A \$2.2 Trillion Coronavirus Aid Package.** In October 2020, Schweikert voted against a coronavirus relief package that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide roughly \$2.2 trillion in funding to further address the health and economic effects of COVID-19, including approximately \$436 billion for direct aid to state and local governments; \$120 billion for assistance to restaurants; \$75 billion for a national testing program; \$28.3 billion for an extended airline industry payroll support program; and funding for state and federal response related to health care, education, housing, and food supply. It would reinstate federal funding of expanded unemployment compensation benefits through January 2021, provide an additional round of tax rebates of \$1,200 for individuals with incomes of \$75,000 or less, and extend the Paycheck Protection Program. The bill would provide \$257 billion for states, territories, and tribal governments and \$179 billion for local governments to address costs and economic impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill. The House passed the bill by a vote of 214-207. \[House Vote 214, [10/1/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll214.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/1/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/214?12); Congressional Actions, [H.R.925](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/925/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+925%22%5D%7d&s=4&r=1)\]

-   **House Democrats Passed The Bill Largely As A "Symbolic Expression" Of Their Frustration With Stalled Talks On Another Coronavirus Aid Package.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "House Democrats passed their own revised version of a coronavirus aid package Thursday, in a largely symbolic expression of frustration with protracted talks on a bipartisan compromise. On a party-line vote of 2014-207, the House sent to the Senate a \$2.2 trillion package that Republicans have lambasted as a costly 'liberal wish list.' No House GOP lawmaker voted for it." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/1/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6021891?1)\]

-   **The Trump Administration Package Offered \$1.5 Trillion, And The Senate Republicans' Proposal Provided Only \$640 Billion.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Trump administration has offered about \$1.5 trillion \[...\] Senate Republicans want to spend even less: They chafed even at a \$1 trillion package over the summer before backing a bill with just \$650 billion in relief --- more than half of it offset." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/1/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6021891?1)\]

-   **The House Democrat Relief Package Included Another Round Of \$1,200 Tax Rebates, Expanded Unemployment Benefits, And Funding For Schools, Health Care, And State And Local Governments.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Democratic bill provide another round of \$1,200-per-adult tax rebates, expanded unemployment benefits, and more money for schools, health care and state and local governments, among other things \[...\] Democrats also pumped some additional money into new priorities since their May legislation. Chief among them is a \$120 billion fund for the pandemic-battered restaurant industry, along with \$28 billion for the airline industry." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/1/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6021891?1)\]

-   **Senate Republicans Are Opposed To Spending Significant Funds On Another Aid Package.** According to the Wall Street Journal, "In reaching a deal, House Democrats and the Trump administration also face another obstacle: Senate Republicans opposed to again doling out money for a major aid package. Many Republicans in the Senate see the economy recovering without additional aid injections and are wary of further deficit spending. After a \$1 trillion plan from GOP leaders didn't draw broad support in their party, last month, Senate Republicans put together a 'skinny' proposal to try to unify their ranks. That bill, which called for \$300 billion in new funds and repurposing \$350 billion in other funds, failed in the Senate when Democrats blocked it." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/1/20](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-aid-talks-still-stuck-after-counteroffer-by-mnuchin-11601570240)\]

### Hospital Aid

**2020: Schweikert Voted For The Paycheck Protection Program And Health Care Enhancement Act, Congress's Fourth Coronavirus Response Bill, Which Provided An Additional \$75 Billion In Funding For Hospitals.** In April 2020, Schweikert voted for the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act as part of Congress's response to the Coronavirus pandemic that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide \$75 billion for the Health and Human Services Department public health and social services emergency fund to reimburse health care providers for expenses and lost revenue related to COVID-19." The vote was on a motion to concur. The House passed the bill by a vote of 388-5 and the bill was then signed into law by the President. \[House Vote 104, [4/23/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll104.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/23/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/104?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R.266](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/266/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+266%22%5D%7d&s=1&r=1)\]

-   **The CARES Act Provided \$100 Billion For Hospitals, But Health Care Providers Said Much More Was Needed.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "This funding is meant to ensure that health care providers receive the support they need for COVID-19-related expenses and to compensate for lost revenue as non-essential and elective procedures are cancelled. The CARES Act enacted in late March \[...\] provided an initial \$100 billion for this purpose, and hospitals and medical groups have said much more will be needed. (The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in early April distributed an initial tranche of \$30 billion to hospitals and other providers, based on their Medicare fee-for-service revenue. That distribution, however, excluded certain hospitals and provided reduced amounts to hospitals that serve large numbers of Medicaid beneficiaries, those with large numbers of Medicare Advantage patients, and those that have high rates of uncompensated care." \[Congressional Quarterly, [4/22/20](https://jukebox.cq.com/www/graphics/har/2020/04/22/har20200422-5889217-factsheet0422.pdf)\]

-   **The Bill Excluded Two Provisions Backed By Health Advocates That Would Ensure Public Hospitals Are Eligible For Small Business Loans And Reduce Interest Ratse In Medicare's Advantage Payment Loan Program.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The funding falls short of the \$318 billion the American Medical Group Association requested in a letter Tuesday to help medical providers cover losses. A survey by the association found that 60 percent of independent doctor group estimate they will deplete their financial reserves in two months, while one-third are providing uncompensated care for area hospitals. The bill does not appear to include two provisions rural and safety-net advocates were pushing --- a clarification ensuring public hospitals are eligible for the small-business loans, and a reduction of a 10 percent interest rate in Medicare's advance payment loan program \[...\] Providers --- including the Federation of American Hospitals, which represents for-profit institutions --- are lobbying for the change." \[Congressional Quarterly, [4/21/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5888195?2)\]

### Housing Assistance

**2020: Schweikert Voted Against Providing Funding For Housing Assistance Grants And Programs In Response To The COVID-19 Pandemic.** In June 2020, Schweikert voted against the Emergency Housing Protections and Relief Act that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "authorize a number of housing assistance grants and programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It would authorize \$100 billion for Housing and Urban Development Department emergency housing assistance grants to support state and local rental assistance programs for individuals at risk of homelessness. It would authorize \$75 billion for a Treasury Department homeowner assistance fund to support state housing finance agency assistance to help homeowners avoid mortgage defaults, foreclosures and loss of utility services. It would prohibit all tenant evictions through March 2021, prohibit all foreclosures for six months after enactment and allow any homeowner facing financial hardship to request mortgage forbearance. It would also require the Federal Reserve to establish a program to provide low-cost loans to residential rental property owners. The bill would authorize over \$24 billion for a number of HUD housing and homelessness assistance programs \[...\] It would also authorize \$309 million for Agriculture Department rural rental assistance." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 232-180. \[House Vote 128, [6/29/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll128.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/128?15); Congressional Actions, [H.R.7301](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7301/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%22hr+7301%22%7d&s=2&r=1)\]

-   **The Bill Was Introduced As The U.S. Approached What Experts Deemed A Housing Crisis Due To The COVID-19 Pandemic.** According to CNBC, "As the U.S. approaches what housing experts have deemed a housing crisis, the House of Representatives passed a bill on Monday that would provide emergency financial relief for tenants and homeowners to keep people housed throughout the coronavirus pandemic \[...\] About 30% of renters have little to no confidence that they can make their next housing payment, according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey. To rectify that, housing experts at the National Low Income Housing Coalition and elsewhere have called for emergency rental assistance and rent cancellation during the pandemic." \[CNBC, [6/30/20](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/30/house-passes-emergency-rental-assistance-and-mortgage-relief-bill.html)\]

-   **Republicans Opposed The Bill, Believing It Rewarded High-Cost Metropolitan Areas For Past Mistakes.** According to CNBC, "Republicans voted against the housing relief bill. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) called the bill a 'Democratic grab bag wish list of policy goals.' 'The fact is that in far too many large, high-cost metropolitan areas, local decisions and regulations have made the cost of housing in those area\[s\] too high for many hardworking families,' Huizenga said. 'We Should not be rewarding these high-cost cities for decades of self-made mistakes with more taxpayer dollars." \[CNBC, [6/30/20](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/30/house-passes-emergency-rental-assistance-and-mortgage-relief-bill.html)\]

### Paycheck Protection Program And Health Care Enhancement Act

It would provide an additional \$310 billion for Paycheck Protection Program loans under the Small Business Administration, including \$60 billion for lending by smaller financial institutions and those serving underbanked communities. The program provides forgivable loans of up to \$10 million for businesses with 500 or fewer employees, including for payroll costs, mortgage payments, and rent or utility payments \[...\] It would provide \$75 billion for the Health and Human Services Department public health and social services emergency fund to reimburse health care providers for expenses and lost revenue related to COVID-19. It would provide \$25 billion to the fund for expenses associated with developing and administering COVID-19 tests, including \$11 billion for state and local governments to manufacture, provide, and analyze such tests." The vote was on a motion to concur. The House passed the bill by a vote of 388-5 and the bill was then signed into law by the President. \[House Vote 104, [4/23/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll104.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/23/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/104?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R.266](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/266/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+266%22%5D%7d&s=1&r=1)\]

-   **Republicans Opposed Measures To Provide Direct Funding To States And Increase Food Aid Despite Efforts By Democrats.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Governors and city county officials wanted the bill to include funding to help address budget shortfalls they face as tax revenues drop off a cliff and spending increases sharply. There's no additional direct aid in the latest package, although Schumer said the White House has committed to more funding \[...\] The bill also doesn't include additional food aid. Democrats originally requested this 'interim' bill include a 15 percent increase to the maximum monthly benefit received by people on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Republicans were opposed." \[Congressional Quarterly, [in the next aid package. 4/21/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5886630?0)\]

-   **CBPP: Republicans' Refusal To Provide State Aid "Will Almost Certainly Lead Many States To Cut Education And Other Critical Services, Including Even Health Care, And To Lay Off Teachers."** According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), "While providing needed support to small businesses and hospitals, the new COVID-19 package announced today falls short even as an interim measure, failing to deliver crucial state and local fiscal relief and food assistance. The White House's refusal to provide more relief to states --- whose revenues are plummeting due to the virus' effect on economic activity --- will almost certainly lead many states to cut education and other critical services, including even health care, and to lay off teachers and other workers as states struggle to balance their budgets \[...\] The approaching state budget cuts \[...\] will cause the U.S. economy to contract further --- making the economic downturn deeper and more protracted, causing many more people to lose their jobs \[...\] Despite efforts from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, additional aid was blocked from inclusion in the new package." \[CPBB, [4/21/20](https://www.cbpp.org/press/statements/greenstein-new-covid-19-bill-helpful-but-inadequate-more-needed-for-states-and)\]

-   **CPBB: Republicans Also Blocked Additional Funding For SNAP, Which Is "Among The Most Effective Simulative Steps The Federal Government Can Take In A Recession, On A Bang-For-The-Buck Basis."** According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), "Similarly disappointing is the White House's and congressional Republicans' refusal to include in the new package an increase in the maximum SNAP (food stamp) benefit, as was done in the last recession. This measure, too, would both alleviate hardship and benefit the economy. Both the Congressional Budget Office and Moody's Analytics rank this measure among the most effective simulative steps the federal government can take in a recession, on a bang-for-the-buck basis." \[CBPP, [4/21/20](https://www.cbpp.org/press/statements/greenstein-new-covid-19-bill-helpful-but-inadequate-more-needed-for-states-and)\]

-   **Democrats Called The Bill And Interim Measure For A Bill That Would Provide More Direct Payments To Individuals And Extended Unemployment Benefits.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Top Democrats are calling the small-business and health care package moving through Congress this week an 'interim' measure to serve as a bridge to a larger bill that could be considered next month. The next bill could include another round of direct payments to households as well as an extension of new jobless benefits provided in the roughly \$2 trillion aid package enacted last month." \[Congressional Quarterly, [4/21/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5886630?0)\]

-   **Some Republicans Criticized The Bill's Price Tag.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill didn't get unanimous support for Senate Republicans, however. Critics cited the impact on the national debt as well as the closed-door negotiations that produced the compromise. 'No amount of money, not all the money in China will save us from ourselves,' said Rand Paul, R-Ky. 'Our Only hope of rescuing this great country is by reopening the economy.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [4/21/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5886630?0)\]

-   **Republicans Refused To Pass The Measure Unanimously Or By Voice Vote, Forcing Members Of Congress To Travel To Washington For A Recorded Vote.** According to The Hill, "GOP leaders, nudged by their conservative flank, rejected the notion of passing the measure either unanimously or by voice vote --- two procedural options that would have precluded the need for lawmakers to return to Washington amid lingering concerns over public travel. Instead, Republicans insisted on staging a recorded vote, which required lawmakers to cast their ballots physically on the chamber floor --- and forced Democratic leaders to adopt some extraordinary steps to ensure that members conformed to the social distancing guidelines established by public health officials." \[The Hill, [4/23/20](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/494401-house-passes-484b-coronavirus-relief-package)\]

### Subcommittee On The Coronavirus Crisis

**2020: Schweikert Voted Against Establishing A Select Subcommittee On The Coronavirus Crisis As A Part Of The House Oversight And Reform Committee.** In April 2020, Schweikert voted against a resolution that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "establish the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis as a part of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, to be composed of no more than 12 representatives, with no more than five appointed by the minority leader. H Res 935 would authorize and direct the subcommittee to conduct a 'full and complete investigation' into the coronavirus crisis and federal response to the crisis, including on the use of taxpayer funds by federal, state and private entities; reports of waste, fraud or other abusive practices; implementation and effectiveness of federal law; economic impacts; executive branch policies, actions and cooperation with Congress and others; and preparedness for response to the crisis. It would also provide the subcommittee chair with subpoena and deposition authorities, and it would provide \$2 million from House accounts to the Oversight and Reform Committee for expenses in the 116th Congress. The subcommittee would cease to exist 30 days after issuing a final report to Congress." The vote was on adoption of a rule that would provide for automatic agreement to a resolution. The House agreed to the resolution by a vote of 212-182. \[House Vote 103, [4/23/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll103.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/23/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/103?2); Congressional Actions, [H.Res.935](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/935/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22h+res+935%22%5D%7d&s=1&r=1)\]

-   **The Panel Was Created To Review The Efficiency, Effectiveness, And Equity Of Funds Provided In The Various Coronavirus Relief Packages.** According to The Hill, "The select panel, which will \[be\] established as an investigative subcommittee of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, will be charged with reviewing the 'efficiency, effectiveness, equity and transparency' of how relief funds are allocated; disparate impacts of the coronavirus on different communities based on demographics such as race, age and geographic region; and the Trump administration's deliberations and communications related to the crisis." \[The Hill, [4/23/20](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/494340-house-votes-to-create-select-committee-to-oversee-coronavirus-response)\]

-   **Congressional Republicans Opposed The Bill, Claiming It Was A Political Move To Make President Trump Look Bad.** According to The Hill, "Republicans dismissed the panel as unnecessary, pointing to the existing House committees with jurisdiction over the coronavirus pandemic like the full Oversight committee and the Ways and Means, Financial Services, Education and Labor, and Energy and Commerce committees \[...\] GOP lawmakers also argued the select committee was an attempt to find ways to make the president look bad ahead of the November election \[...\] But Democrats maintained that a crisis of the pandemic's magnitude --- and the trillions of dollars already spent to boost the government's response --- warranted a special oversight arm." \[The Hill, [4/23/20](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/494340-house-votes-to-create-select-committee-to-oversee-coronavirus-response)\]

-   **Health Experts Said That Expanded Testing Is Critical For The U.S. To Reopen The Economy.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Health experts say that for states to responsibly lift business restrictions and 'reopen' the U.S. economy, it is critical to test the population to understand the extent of infections so infected individuals can be isolated and those with whom they interacted can be traced. Such information also is needed to give the public confidence it can safely return to work and resume other activities \[...\] Such testing is needed especially for frontline workers who may have been exposed to the virus, such as health care providers, police and fire fighters, transit workers and grocery clerks." \[Congressional Quarterly, [4/22/20](https://jukebox.cq.com/www/graphics/har/2020/04/22/har20200422-5889217-factsheet0422.pdf)\]
