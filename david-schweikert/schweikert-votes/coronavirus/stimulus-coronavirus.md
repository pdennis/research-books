# Coronavirus Stimulus

### Tax Rebates

**2020: Schweikert Voted Against The CASH Act Which Would Increase Tax Rebates From \$600 To \$2,000 To Eligible Americans.** In December 2020, Schweikert voted against the Caring for Americans with Supplemental Help Act (CASH) Act of 2020 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "increase tax rebates provided by the fiscal 2021 omnibus appropriations and coronavirus relief law (HR 133) from \$600 to \$2,000 for individuals and for each dependent. It would expand eligibility to include adult dependents, including retroactively with regard to \$500 increases for rebates under previous law (HR 748 / PL 116-136)." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 275-134. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 252, [12/28/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll252.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/28/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/252?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 9051](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/9051/actions)\]

-   **Democrats Filed H.R. 9051 After President Trump Requested Checks To Be Increased To \$2,000 Per Adult.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "A statement Trump issued after he signed the bill said he told Congress he wanted \$2,000 checks per adult and \$600 per child. The House bill goes further in boosting the amount for dependents to \$2,000 as well, while also sending out \$500 checks to adult dependents that didn\'t receive those in the March aid package." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/28/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6085569?11)\]

-   **Conservative Advocacy Group, Americans For Prosperity, Opposed The Increased Tax Rebate Arguing That Direct Payments Do Not Stimulate The Economy.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group, sent a \"key vote\" letter to lawmakers Monday urging them to vote against the bill, arguing past experience shows direct payments do not stimulate the economy because people typically save the money or use it to pay down debt." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/28/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6085569?11)\]
