# COVID-19 Vaccines

### Vaccine Tax

**2022: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Adding COVID-19 Vaccines To The List Of Vaccines Subject To A 75 Cent Tax Per Dose; Such Proceeds Would Be Used For Vaccine-Related Injury Or Death Compensation.** In June 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert effectively voted against a bill that would "add COVID-19 vaccines to a list of vaccines subject to a tax of 75 cents per dose, from which proceeds fund compensation for vaccine-related injury or death through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program." The vote was on the adoption of the rule. The House adopted the rule by a vote of 217-203, thus the bill was automatically adopted. \[House Vote 298, [6/24/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll298.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/24/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/298?10); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4346](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4346/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 1204](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/1204/actions)\]
