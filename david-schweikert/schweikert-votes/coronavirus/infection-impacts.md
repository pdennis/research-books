**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Authorizing \$10 Million For Competitive Grants To Support Interdisciplinary Research On The Impacts On Cognitive Processes After COVID-19 Infections.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the Brycen Gray and Ben Price COVID--19 Cognitive Research Act, which would "authorize \$10 million for the National Science Foundation to award competitive grants to support interdisciplinary research on the disruption of regular cognitive processes associated with COVID-19 infections. It would specify that this includes long COVID-19 and infections in children and adolescents. Within total authorized funding, it would authorize \$1 million for the foundation, in partnership with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, to produce a study, within 16 months of the bill\'s enactment, on the disruption of cognitive processes associated with COVID-19 infection. It would require the National Academies to submit a report to Congress on the study and then require the foundation, within three months of that report, to submit to Congress a summary of any plans to implement recommendations contained in the report." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote 359-62, thus the bill was sent to Senate. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 391, [7/26/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll391.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/26/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/391?11); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7180](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7180/all-actions)\]
