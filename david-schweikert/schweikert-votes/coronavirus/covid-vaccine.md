-   **The American Rescue Plan Required Medicaid And CHIP To Cover Expenses Associated To COVID Testing, Treatment And Vaccines, Including People With Limited Benefits, And Required The Federal Government To Cover COVID Testing, Treatment And Vaccines For Uninsured Individuals.** According to Health Law, "For all Medicaid enrollees, the ARP explicitly requires Medicaid and CHIP to provide testing, treatment and vaccines without any cost-sharing. And all individuals, even those in limited scope benefit categories (e.g. only receiving Medicaid for treatment of breast or cervical cancer or family planning services and supplies), will receive the COVID vaccine. These requirements continue until the end of the first quarter after the end of the public health emergency. Further, the ARP expands a state to not only cover COVID testing but also treatment and vaccines for uninsured individuals. The federal government covers 100% of the costs for these individuals." \[Health Law, [3/12/21](https://healthlaw.org/the-american-rescue-plan-act-whats-it-do-for-health/)\]
