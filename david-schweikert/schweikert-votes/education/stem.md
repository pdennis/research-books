### STEM Education Advisory Panel

**2015: Schweikert Voted For Giving The Speaker Of The House And The Senate Majority Leader The Authority To Appoint Members To The Underlying Bill's STEM Education Advisory Panel.** In May 2015, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would give the House Speaker and Senate Majority leader the ability to appoint members to the underlying bill's STEM Education Advisory Panel. According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have "provide\[d\] for the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader to appoint members of the STEM Education Advisory Panel that would be established under the bill and an advisory committee that the bill would direct to be established to review and report on progress by the Energy Department on a carbon capture and sequestration research program." The underlying bill was H.R. 1806, the America Competes Reauthorization Act, which "authorize\[d\] \$32.9 billion over fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 for a number of agencies that support scientific research, industrial innovation and certain educational activities." The vote was on the amendment. The House agreed to the amendment by a vote of 234 to 183. The underlying measure later passed the full House, but the Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 253, [5/20/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll253.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/20/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/253?51); Congressional Quarterly, [5/20/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/258?16); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Legislation Created A STEM Education Advisory Panel Which Would Make Recommendations On STEM Education Programs.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Under the measure, the president must create a STEM Education Advisory Panel that incorporates key stakeholders from the education and industry sectors. The co-chairpersons would be members of the President\'s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. The panel is to assess and develop recommendations on matters relating to STEM education. Each year the panel must provide general guidance to every federal agency with STEM education programs or activities, including in the preparation of requests for appropriations for activities related to STEM education." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/15/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4684616/19?2&search=1i5nN0Ko)\]
