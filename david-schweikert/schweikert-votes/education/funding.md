### Proportional State Funding

**2023: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Would Have Required Funding Under The Elementary And Secondary Education Act To Be Distributed To Each State In A Proportional Amount To The Number Of Students In The State In Relation To The Nationwide Total Of Students.** In March 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against an amendment to the Parents Bill of Rights Act, which would "require any funds made available under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act after the bill\'s enactment to be consolidated and awarded to each state in a proportional amount to the number of students in the state relative to the total number of students in the United States, for each state to carry out educational activities permitted by state laws." The vote was on the adoption of an amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 83 to 331. \[House Vote 159, [3/24/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll159.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/24/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/159?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 129](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/129/actions?s=a&r=1)\]

-   **The Elementary And Secondary Education Act Provides New Grants To Low-Income School Districts, Grants For Textbooks And Books, Funding For Special Education, Scholarships For Low-Income College Students, And Grants For State Education Agencies To Better The Quality Of Elementary And Secondary Education.** According to the U.S. Department Of Education, "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was signed into law in 1965 by President Lyndon Baines Johnson, who believed that 'full educational opportunity' should be 'our first national goal.' From its inception, ESEA was a civil rights law. ESEA offered new grants to districts serving low-income students, federal grants for textbooks and library books, funding for special education centers, and scholarships for low-income college students. Additionally, the law provided federal grants to state educational agencies to improve the quality of elementary and secondary education." \[U.S. Department Of Education, [Accessed on 7/5/23](https://www.ed.gov/essa?src=rn)\]
