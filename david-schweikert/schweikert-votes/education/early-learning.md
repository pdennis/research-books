### Child Care

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against The American Rescue Plan Act Of 2021, Which Granted States \$39 Billion For Child Care Block Grants.** In March 2021, Schweikert voted against concurring in the Senate amendment to the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide \$39 billion for child care block grants to states." The vote was on concurring in the Senate amendment to the bill. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote of 220-211 and sent to the President and ultimately the bill became law. \[House Vote 72, [3/10/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll072.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/10/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/72?24); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1319](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/actions)\]

-   **The American Rescue Plan Reserved \$15 Billion For The Child Care And Development Block Grant Program To Aid Child Care Facilities, Especially In Areas With High Need.** According to NPR, "Nearly \$15 billion in funds are directed to the Child Care & Development Block Grant program to help support child care facilities, particularly in high-need areas." \[NPR, [3/11/21](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/03/09/974841565/heres-whats-in-the-american-rescue-plan-as-it-heads-toward-final-passage)\]

-   **Of The Appropriated Funds, \$15 Billion Were Directed To The Child Care And Development Block Grant And \$24 Billion Were For The Establishment Of A Stabilization Fund For Eligible Qualifying Child Care Providers.** According to CLASP, "Of the \$39 billion\[4\] included in the American Rescue Plan Act (ARP Act), nearly \$15 billion will provide expanded child care assistance through the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) to support families and providers, including supporting the child care needs of essential workers. The remaining nearly \$24 billion creates a stabilization fund for eligible child care providers, including those who haven't previously received funding through CCDBG." \[CLASP, [3/10/21](https://www.clasp.org/publications/fact-sheet/child-care-estimates-american-rescue-plan#cc4)\]

-   **The Reserved Funds For Child Care Block Grants Helped Cover Various Expenses, Including Worker Compensation, Facility Rent And Maintenance, Personal Protective Equipment And COVID Materials, Necessities To Continue To Provide Care, Mental Health Assistance For Children And Educators, And Reimbursements Relating To The Pandemic.** According to CLASP, "These funds can stabilize child care programs by covering a range of expenses such as personnel costs, rent, facility maintenance and improvements, personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-related supplies, goods and services needed to resume providing care, mental health supports for children and early educators, and reimbursement of costs associated with the current public health emergency." \[CLASP, [3/10/21](https://www.clasp.org/publications/fact-sheet/child-care-estimates-american-rescue-plan#cc4)\]
