### Parents Bill Of Rights Act

**2023: Schweikert Voted For The Parents Bill Of Rights Act, Which Would Require Schools That Receive Federal Funding To Obtain Parental Consent Before Conducting Non-Emergency Medical Exams Or Changing A Student's Gender Markers, Allow Parents To Inspect Instructional Materials, And Require Schools To Report To Parents If Their Child Goes By Different Pronouns Or Names.** In March 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Parents Bill of Rights Act, which would "establish various requirements for public elementary and secondary schools to provide parents with information and certain rights regarding their children's education. It would generally require schools that receive federal funding to obtain parental consent before providing a non-emergency medical screening or examination or before changing a child's gender markers or sex-based accommodations. It would require schools to allow parents to inspect and provide feedback on all instructional and reading materials used in evaluations or available to students through school libraries, as well as professional development materials for teachers. It would prohibit schools from acting as agents of parents to consent to the use of online technology or the administration of vaccinations, and from selling student information for commercial gain. To increase transparency at Title I schools, the bill would generally require school districts to publicly disseminate curricula for each grade, as well as notices of any changes to the state's academic standards; include detailed budget information for each school in their annual report cards; and allow parents to meet with teachers at least twice a year, address the school board and review professional development materials. It would require local educational agencies to ensure that Title I schools provide and inform parents of their rights to receive information regarding their child's education, including if a school changes their child's gender markers or sex-based accommodations, the number of school counselors in their child\'s school, if their child receives mental health treatment or brings a weapon to school, all enrollment and transfer options, planned outside speakers at school events, violent activity on school grounds, elimination of gifted and talented programs, and notification if a student is not grade-level proficient in reading at the end of third grade. Among other provisions, the bill would specify that it does not authorize federal involvement in curriculum or school personnel decisions and does not authorize parents to prohibit students who are not their children from accessing books or reading materials available in a school\'s library. It would express the sense of Congress that public school students should have access to broadband and opportunities to learn the history of the Holocaust and anti-Semitism, and that parents have a constitutional right to 'direct the education of their children.'" The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 213 to 208, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 161, [3/24/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll161.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/24/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/161?77); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5/all-actions)\]
