# Student Loans

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2016 Conference Report Budget Resolution, Which Assumes Savings From The In-School Interest Subsidy, Repeal Of The Expansion Of Income-Driven Repayment And Elimination Of Public-Sector Loan Forgiveness.** In April 2015, Schweikert voted against the FY 2016 Conference Report budget resolution which, according to Congressional Quarterly, "reflects the current post-sequester caps on discretionary spending - \$523 billion for defense and \$493.5 billion for non-defense programs in fiscal 2016. Raising the caps would require a change in law." According to the Washington Post, "There is no explicit language in the budget resolution calling for cuts to other higher education programs, but there is a broad reduction of mandatory spending that will impact such programs. And House Republicans have made it clear which ones they have in mind. During a budget markup in March, Republican Budget Committee Policy Director Jane Lee said the budget assumes savings from the end of the in-school interest subsidy on student loans, the repeal of the expansion of an income-driven repayment program and the elimination of public-sector loan forgiveness." The vote was on the Conference Report; the Conference Report passed by a vote of 226 to 197. The Senate also passed the budget resolution. \[House Vote 183, [4/30/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll183.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/5/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/S/171?3); Washington Post, [5/7/15](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/05/07/how-the-gop-house-republican-takes-aim-at-funding-for-college-students/); Congressional Actions, [S. Con. Res. 11](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-concurrent-resolution/11/all-actions)\]

-   **Low Income Students Would Be Squeezed By The Elimination Of The Subsidized Stafford Loan.** According to the Washington Post, "Lower income students would be squeezed by the end of subsidized Stafford loans, on which the government pays the interest while the borrower is in school. The Education Department estimates that as of the end of December over 28 million borrowers received these loans." \[Washington Post, [5/7/15](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/05/07/how-the-gop-house-republican-takes-aim-at-funding-for-college-students/)\]

-   **Expanded Income-Driven Repayment Caps A Borrower's Monthly Bill At 10 Percent, Repeal Of Expansion Could Double Some Borrowers Monthly Payment.** According to the Washington Post, "The resolution also calls for the reversal of President Obama\'s expansion of a student loan program that caps a borrower\'s monthly bill at 10 percent of income and forgives the debt after 20 years of payment. That income-driven plan, known as Pay As You Earn (PAYE), is part of a suite of repayment options that\'s supposed to prevent borrowers from defaulting on their loans, a problem faced by about 20 percent of people repaying college debt. \[...\] An analysis by TICAS concludes that the Republican budget could double the student loan payments of borrowers enrolling in PAYE. If someone owing \$29,000 in federal student loans and earning \$35,000 a year enrolled in the program, for example, that person\'s initial payment could increase from \$145 a month under the current program to \$217 a month under the reduced program." \[Washington Post, [5/7/15](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/05/07/how-the-gop-house-republican-takes-aim-at-funding-for-college-students/)\]

-   **Resolution Also Calls On Lawmakers To Repeal The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program Which Incentives Careers That Serve The Public.** According to the Washington Post, 'The budget resolution also calls on lawmakers to get rid of Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which forgives any remaining student loan debt for borrowers who work in the public sector for 10 years. Advocacy groups have argued that the program, created in 2007, is an incentive for students to pursue careers, like public interest law or teaching, that serve the public but may not earn a lot of money. According to the Education Department, some 600,000 borrowers could qualify for the public sector program through fiscal year 2025." \[Washington Post, [5/7/15](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/05/07/how-the-gop-house-republican-takes-aim-at-funding-for-college-students/)\]

-   **President Obama's Budget Capped Public Service Loan Forgiveness at \$57,500.** According to US News, "The president's proposal would make Pay As You Earn the only income-driven plan available for borrowers moving forward, but it would also enforce stricter limits on benefits. Graduate student loan borrowers with balances of \$57,500 and higher would be eligible for forgiveness after 25 years of payment, not 20, and the amount eligible for public service forgiveness would be capped at \$57,500. Also, any payments made under non-income-driven plans would not count toward public service loan forgiveness." \[US News, [2/11/15](http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/student-loan-ranger/2015/02/11/what-obamas-2016-budget-proposal-means-for-student-borrowers)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2016 Budget Resolution Which Recommends Repealing Mandatory Spending Provisions For The Income-Based Repayment Program's 2010 Expansion And Eliminate The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted against the FY 2016 budget resolution which calls for eliminating certain funding for the 2010 expansion of the Income-Based Repayment Program. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Other proposals recommended by the committee report include the following: \[...\] Repeal certain mandatory education funding made available under the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2010 (including expansion of the Income-Based Repayment program), eliminate in-school interest subsidies for undergraduate students and terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program." The vote was on the budget resolution. The House passed the resolution 228 to 199. The budget resolution died in the Senate, but a similar concurrent resolution did pass both Houses. \[House Vote 142, [3/25/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll142.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/23/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4648745?4); Congressional Actions, [S.

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against A FY 2016 Budget Resolution Which Recommends Repealing Mandatory Spending Provisions For The Income-Based Repayment Program's 2010 Expansion And Eliminated The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted against a FY 2016 Budget Resolution which calls for eliminating certain funding for the 2010 expansion of the Income-Based Repayment Program. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Other proposals recommended by the committee report include the following: \[...\] Repeal certain mandatory education funding made available under the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2010 (including expansion of the Income-Based Repayment program), eliminate in-school interest subsidies for undergraduate students and terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program." The vote was on the adopting the substitute amendment. The House passed the amendment 219 to 208 and later passed the budget resolution. The budget resolution died in the Senate, but a similar concurrent resolution did pass both Houses. \[House Vote 141, [3/25/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll141.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/23/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4648745?4); Congressional Actions, [S.

The House later adopted a substitute amendment identical to this except for a change in defense spending and then later passed the budget resolution. The budget resolution died in the Senate, but a similar concurrent resolution did pass both Houses. \[House Vote 140, [3/25/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll140.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/23/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4648745?4); Congressional Quarterly, [3/30/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4655279?20&search=7riX3e6K); Congressional Actions, [S.

### Consumer Protections

**2017: Schweikert Voted Against Exempting Regulations Related To Consumer Protections On Student Loan From The SCRUB Act, Which Would Require Agencies To Eliminate Old Rules In Order To Create New Ones.** In March 2017, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "exempt\[ed\] from the bill's provisions rules related to providing consumer protections for student loan borrowers." The underlying legislation, also according to Congressional Quarterly, "establish\[ed\] a nine-member commission to review existing federal regulations and identify regulations that should be repealed on the basis of reducing costs on the U.S. economy. The commission would identify those regulatory policies that should be repealed immediately, and would set up a 'Cut-Go' system that would require agencies to repeal existing rules to offset costs before issuing a new rule. The measure, as amended, would require the commission to review a rule or regulation's unfunded mandate, whether the rule or regulation limits or prevents government agencies from adopting technology to improve efficiency, and the rule or regulation's impact on wage growth, when determining if the rule or regulation should be repealed." The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 191 to 235. \[House Vote 109, [3/1/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll109.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/1/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/109?4); Congressional Quarterly, [1/7/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/20?12); Congressional Actions, [H.

### Discharged Loans

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Discharging Student Loans When A Student Dies Or Becomes Permanently Disabled.** In May 2021, Schweikert voted against the Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require lenders to discharge private education loans when a student borrower dies or is permanently disabled, including for any cosigners of the loan." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 215-207. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 141, [5/13/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll141.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/13/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/141?9); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2547](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2547/actions)\]

### Doubling Student Loan Interest Rates From 3.4 Percent To 6.8 Percent

**2013: Schweikert Voted For Increasing Student Loan Interest Rates From 3.4 Percent To 6.8 Percent As Part Of The FY 2014 Ryan Budget.** In March 2013, Schweikert voted for increasing student loan interest rates from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent, as part of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's (R-WI) proposed budget resolution covering fiscal years 2014 to 2023. According to Education Votes, "\[T\]he Ryan plan \[...\] would allow student loan interest rates on new Stafford loans to double this July, from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent." The resolution passed the House by a vote of 221 to 207, but died in the Senate. \[House Vote 88, [3/21/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll088.xml); Education Votes, [3/20/13](http://educationvotes.nea.org/2013/03/20/ryan-budget-puts-college-further-out-of-reach/); Congressional Actions, [H. Con. Res. 25](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/25/all-actions)\]

### Eliminating Subsidies For Undergraduate Student Loans

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Eliminate Interest-Subsidized Federal Loans For Undergraduate Students, As Part Of Rep. Paul Ryan's Budget Proposal.** In April 2014, Schweikert voted to eliminate federal in-school interest subsidies for undergraduate student loans, as part of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's (R-WI) proposed budget resolution covering fiscal years 2015 to 2024. According to the House Budget Committee Fiscal Year 2015 "Path to Prosperity": "Accept the Fiscal Commission's Proposal to Eliminate In-School Interest Subsidies for Undergraduate Students. The federal government focuses aid decisions on family income prior to a student's enrollment and then provides a number of repayment protections and, in some cases, loan forgiveness after graduation. There is no evidence that in-school interest subsidies are critical to individual matriculation." The House adopted the budget resolution by a vote of 219 to 205, but the Senate did not. \[House Vote 177, [4/10/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll177.xml); House Budget Committee, [4/1/14](http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fy15_blueprint.pdf#page=50); Congressional Actions, [H. Con. Res. 96](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/96/all-actions)\]

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Eliminate Subsidies For Undergraduate Student Loans.** In March 2013, Schweikert voted to support eliminating subsidies on undergraduate student loans, as part of the Republican Study Committee's proposed budget resolution covering fiscal years 2014 to 2023. According to the Republican Study Committee, "The Budget Control Act of 2011 ended in school subsidies for graduate students, and the RSC budget proposes a policy that would end in school subsidies for undergraduate students. This would save \$54 billion over ten years." The vote was on an amendment to the House budget resolution replacing the entire budget with the RSC's proposed budget; the amendment failed by a vote of 104 to 132 with 171 Democrats voting present. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Repeating a strategy from last year, 171 Democrats voted "present" to push Republicans to vote against the RSC plan to make sure it did not have enough support to replace the Ryan plan." \[House Vote 86, [3/21/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll086.xml); Republican Study Committee, [3/18/13](http://rsc.scalise.house.gov/uploadedfiles/back_to_basics-rsc_fy2014_budget.pdf#23); Congressional Quarterly, [3/25/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/weeklyreport-4245452); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 35](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/35/actions); Congressional Actions, [H. Con. Res. 25](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/25/all-actions)\]

-   **Removing Subsidies For Student Loans Would Cause Students Who Took The Maximum In Loans To Owe \$9,000 More In Interest Payments.** According to Insider Higher Ed, "Subsidized loans, which are awarded based on financial need, make up just under half of all Stafford loans, which are the federal government's largest pool of student loans. Students who borrow the maximum amount of subsidized loans, \$23,000, and take six years to graduate would owe \$5,000 more by graduation and \$9,000 after a 20-year repayment period, said Pauline Abernathy, vice president of the Institute for College Access and Success." \[Inside Higher Ed, [7/13/11](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/07/13/possible_threat_to_subsidized_student_loans_in_debt_talks)\]

### Fixed Rates

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Issue New Federal Student Loans At Fixed Rates Set Each Year Based On Market Conditions, But With A Cap On The Maximum Rate.** In July 2013, Schweikert voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would set federal student loan interest rates issued after July 1, 2013 to the Treasury Department\'s 10-year borrowing rate, plus 2.05 percent for subsidized and unsubsidized undergraduate loans, 3.6 percent for graduate loans and 4.6 percent for PLUS loans. The loan rates would be capped at 8.25 percent, 9.5 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively." This vote was on a motion that the House suspend the rules and agree to the Senate amendment to the bill. The motion passed by a vote of 392 to 31. The amended bill was then signed into law by the president. \[House Vote 426, [7/31/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll426.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/24/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/floorvote-241100000); Public Law 113-28, [8/9/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-113publ28/pdf/PLAW-113publ28.pdf); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1911](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1911/all-actions)\]

-   **Before Bill, Federal Student Loan Rates Had Been Set At 3.4 Percent Since July, 2011, But Had Risen To 6.8 Percent On July 1.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "In September 2007, Congress enacted the College Cost Reduction Act (PL 110-84), which overhauled federal student aid programs, primarily by reducing the federal subsidies paid to private lenders that offer federally backed student loans and redirecting the savings to enhance other student aid programs. Among other things, the law set fixed interest rates for federally subsidized, undergraduate student loans, which previously had been tied to economic factors and were increasing at the time. Specifically, interest rates on the popular Stafford loan programs were reduced for new loans, dropping to 6% on July 1, 2009, and gradually declining to 3.4% on July 1, 2011. The lower interest rates were initially set to expire July 1, 2012, and were supposed to increase to 6.8% for student loans originated on or after that date. To prevent that increase during the 2012 presidential campaign, Congress last year enacted the Interest Rate Reduction Act as part of the surface transportation authorization law. \[...\] The student loan provisions of that law extended the 3.4% interest rate for new, federally subsidized, undergraduate student loans for another year, through June 30, 2013." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4323534/16)\]

-   **Under Final Legislation And Treasury Note Rate At Time, Interest Rate On Federal Undergraduate Student Loans Issued From July 1, 2013 To June 1, 2014 Would Be Fixed 3.86 Percent Loans.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Specifically, \[the final legislation\] ties the interest rates for all federal student loans (except Perkins loans) issued on or after July 1, 2013, to 10-year Treasury notes --- with rates for subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans to be set each year at the 10-year Treasury note plus 2.05%, rates for graduate loans to be set at the 10-year note plus 3.6% and rates for parent PLUS loans to be set at the 10-year note plus 4.6%. \[...\] Rates each year would be determined on June 1, with the Treasury note rate being set by the most recent Treasury auction (therefore, all loan rates this year would be based off the 1.81% 10-year Treasury rate from May). Those rates would remain in effect for the 12-month period beginning July 1 --- and loans made to students during that period would remain at that same interest rate for the life of the loan." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4323534/16)\]

-   **April 2013: Obama Administration Proposed Changing System To Fixed Interest Rate Loans Set Based On Market Conditions When The Loan Is Issued.** According to the President's FY 2014 Budget, "Under current law, interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans are slated to rise this summer from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. At a time when the economy is still recovering and market interest rates remain low, the Budget proposes a cost-neutral reform to set interest rates so they more closely follow market rates, and to provide students with more affordable re-payment options. The rate on new loans would be set each year based on a market interest rate, which would remain fixed for the life of the loan so that student borrowers would have certainty about the rates they would pay. The Budget also expands repayment options to ensure that student borrowers do not have to pay more than 10 percent of their discretionary income on loan payments." \[Office of Management and Budget, [4/10/13](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2014/assets/education.pdf#page=5)\]

-   **Republicans Supportive Of Administration Proposal, But Democrats Opposed Due To Lack Of Interest Rate Cap.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "President Obama, as part of his FY 2014 budget, proposed returning student loan interest rates to a system of market-based variable rates tagged to 10-year Treasury notes. \[...\] Congressional Republicans expressed support for the concept, while Democrats generally were critical of the proposal because it failed to cap interest rates." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4323534/16)\]

-   **May 2013: House Passed Student Loan Legislation Which Would Have Set Up System Of Adjustable Interest Rate Loans, Based On Market Conditions, Capped At 8.5 Percent For Undergraduate Loans, 10.5 Percent For Graduate And PLUS Loans.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "In May, the House passed the Smarter Solutions for Students Act (HR 1911) by a vote of 221 to 198. Similar to the president\'s proposal, it would tie the interest rates for all federal student loans (except Perkins loans) issued on or after July 1, 2013, to 10-year Treasury notes --- with rates for subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans to be set each year at the 10-year Treasury note plus 2.5% and rates for graduate and parent PLUS loans to be set at the 10-year note plus 4.5%. Overall interest rates would be capped at 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively. Under the House-passed bill, the interest rates on loans taken out by students each year would \"float\" and be reset each subsequent year for the life of the loan to reflect any increases or decreases in rates." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4323534/16)\]

-   **Obama Administration Threatened A Veto Of House Legislation Due To Adjustable Rates And Because It Proposed Using Proceeds From Higher Interest Rates To Reduce Deficit.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "While the Administration welcomes action by the House on this issue, H.R. 1911 is the wrong approach. First, the bill would not guarantee low rates for today\'s students. A rate that continues to vary after the loan has already been taken out would create uncertainty and lessen transparency for students and their families who are making decisions about borrowing for college. Second, the bill\'s changes would impose the largest interest rate increases on low- and middle-income students and families who struggle most to afford a college education. Third, the bill does not include the President\'s proposal to extend repayment options to borrowers who have already left school and often face the same debt burdens as current and future students. Finally, the Administration believes that student loan interest rates should not be raised to reduce the deficit. If the President were presented with this legislation in its current form, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill" (underline omitted). \[Office of Management and Budget, [5/22/13](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/113/saphr1911r_20130522.pdf)\]

-   **July 2013: Bipartisan Group Of Senators Negotiated Agreement With White House, This Vote Was On The Legislation Representing That Agreement.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "A bipartisan group of senators then began trying to negotiate a compromise, even as the interest rate on Stafford loans returned to 6.8% on July 1. Those negotiators, with the participation of the White House, eventually reached agreement the week of July 15, and it was introduced as a separate bill (S 1334) on July 18. The administration on July 24 released a Statement of Administration Policy expressing strong support for the agreement, and later that same day the Senate adopted it by a 81-18 vote as a substitute to the House bill after rejecting modifications proposed by liberal Democrats." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4323534/16)\]

-   **Obama Administration Strongly Supported Final Senate Legislation.** According to the Office of Management and Budget, "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 1911. \[...\] It would reduce interest rates for nearly 11 million borrowers taking out new loans this school year, including those who borrowed since the rates rose on July 1st. Also, it would cut rates on all types of borrowers this year, including those for undergraduates taking out unsubsidized Stafford loans, graduate students, and parent borrowers. The Senate amendment does not contain the flaws that were in some of the previous legislative efforts to address this issue. In particular, the amendment rejects a variable interest rate that resets every year, which would put students at risk of paying more over time. Instead, it would give borrowers the certainty of a fixed interest rate on each loan to eliminate the risk of being burdened with additional costs, and would provide firm caps on how high interest rates on new student loans can rise in the future. The amendment also rejects unfair and unwise approaches that would raise student loan interest rates to pay for deficit reduction." \[Office of Management and Budget, [7/24/13](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/113/saphr1911sa_20130724.pdf)\]

**2020: Schweikert Voted Against Overturning A Trump Administration Rule That Rolled Back Protections For Student Loan Borrowers.** In June 2020, Schweikert voted against overriding President Trump's veto on a joint resolution that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for congressional disapproval of a September 2019 Education Department rule establishing new policies related to federal student loan forgiveness for borrowers who attended schools that committed fraud or any type of institutional misrepresentation, requiring such borrowers to demonstrate financial harm as a result of the fraud to receive complete or partial cancellation of student loan debt. The rule would also allow for mandatory arbitration agreements related to such claims and require borrowers to file claims within three years of leaving an institution. The rule is currently scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2020. Under the provisions of the joint resolution, the 2019 rule would have no force or effect, and October 2016 rules that provide for complete cancellation of federal student loan debt for defrauded borrowers would be effectively maintained." The vote was on passage over President Trump's veto. The House failed to override the President's veto by a vote of 238-173. \[House Vote 120, [6/26/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll120.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/26/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/120?6); Congressional Actions, [H.J.Res.76](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-joint-resolution/76/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hj+res+76%22%5D%7d&s=3&r=1)\]

### Funding Savings

**2014: Schweikert Voted Against Refunding To Student Borrowers The Amount They Would Have Saved Had They Refinanced At 2013-2014 Rates.** In July 2014, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would \[have\] establish\[ed\] a program to provide rebates to student loan borrowers equal to the amount they would save if the loan \[had been\] refinanced at the rates offered during the 2013-2014 academic year." The underlying bill, according to a separate Congressional Quarterly article, "would authorize the Education Department to establish up to 30 competency-based education demonstration projects, which would allow students to earn credits for information mastered as opposed to instructional time. It would allow participating students to receive federal aid and allow the department to waive any Higher Education Act requirements that inhibit the operation of competency-based education programs." The vote was on a motion to recommit the bill to the House Education and the Workforce Committee with instructions that it be reported back immediately with the specified amendment. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 194 to 221. \[House Vote 440, [7/23/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll440.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/23/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/440); Congressional Quarterly, [7/23/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/441); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3163](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3136/all-actions)\]

-   **The 2013-2014 Interest Rate On Federal Undergraduate Stafford Student Loans Was 3.86 Percent.** According to Forbes, "For the Stafford loan, which is a federal form of aid reserved for undergraduate students, the 0.8% bump in 10-year yield means that the interest rate will go from its current 3.86% fixed rate to a 4.66% fixed rate for loans disbursed July 1, 2014 until June 30, 2015." \[Forbes, [5/7/14](http://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2014/05/07/federal-student-loan-interest-rates-set-to-rise-for-2014-2015-school-year/)\]

-   **The 2014-2015 Interest Rate On Federal Undergraduate Stafford Student Loans Is 4.66 Percent, Which Will Cost The Borrower An Extra \$229.67 Over The 10 Year Life Of A \$5,000 Loan.** According to Forbes, "While an 0.8% rate hike may seem relatively benign --- and, indeed, it's certainly better than interest rates doubling, as they nearly did last year --- it's not nothing. Consider the following: a \$5,000 subsidized Stafford loan repaid over a 10-year period would cost a borrower \$1,034.88 in interest at the current 3.86% rate. At the new 4.66% rate, that very same loan would cost a borrower \$1,264.55 in interest, or an extra \$229.67 over the life of the loan." \[Forbes, [5/7/14](http://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2014/05/07/federal-student-loan-interest-rates-set-to-rise-for-2014-2015-school-year/)\]

### In School Subsidies

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating In-School Undergraduate Student Loan Subsidies.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted for a budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555, [10/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll555.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/5/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/555?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating In-School Undergraduate Student Loan Subsidies.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Eliminate In-School Subsidies for Undergraduates Under current law, interest does not accrue for undergraduate students who take advantage of federally subsidized student loans. Meanwhile, recent reforms eliminated the in-school subsidy for graduate students. This budget proposes to also eliminate the in-school subsidy for undergraduate students, which would ask a typical student to repay only \$37 more per month while savings taxpayers almost \$30 billion over the next decade.298 Importantly, this reform would also more accurately show the true cost of these loans to students and parents, encouraging them to properly weigh the risks, costs, and benefits of using federal financing and incentivizing students to pursue studies likely to result in careers worth the cost of their degree." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed 10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]

### Income-Based Repayment

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The House GOP FY 2018 Budget Resolution, Which Started The Process Towards Tax Reform, Called For Ending Medicare As We Know It And Called Eliminating The Expanded Income-Based Repayment Program.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted for the House GOP FY 2018 budget resolution. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Adoption of the concurrent resolution that would provide for \$3.2 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018, not including off-budget accounts. It would assume \$1.22 trillion in discretionary spending in fiscal 2018. It would assume the repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul law. It also would propose reducing spending on mandatory programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and changing programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (also known as food stamps). It would call for restructuring Medicare into a 'premium support' system beginning in 2024. I would also require the House Ways and Means Committee to report out legislation under the budget reconciliation process that would provide for a revenue-neutral, comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. tax code and would include instructions to 11 House committees to trigger the budget reconciliation process to cut mandatory spending. The concurrent resolution would assume that, over 10 years, base (non-Overseas Contingency Operations) discretionary defense spending would be increased by a total of \$929 billion over the Budget Control Act caps and non-defense spending be reduced by \$1.3 trillion." The vote was on passage. The House passed the budget resolution by a vote of 219 to 206. A modified version was later agreed to by both the House and the Senate. \[House Vote 557, [10/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll557.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/5/17](http://www.cq.com/vote/2017/H/557?1); Congressional Actions, [H.

### Market Rates

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Have The Interest Rate On A Federal Student Loan Change Each Year, Depending On Market Conditions.** In May 2013, Schweikert voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would tie the interest rates for all federal student loans (except Perkins loans) issued on or after July 1, 2013, to 10-year Treasury notes --- with rates for subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans to be set each year at the 10-year Treasury note plus 2.5% and rates for graduate and parent PLUS loans to be set at the 10-year note plus 4.5%. Overall interest rates would be capped at 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively. Under the House-passed bill, the interest rates on loans taken out by students each year would 'float' and be reset each subsequent year for the life of the loan to reflect any increases or decreases in rates." The bill passed by a vote of 221 to 198. Another version of the bill was passed by the Senate and the House ultimately agreed to the Senate version. The bill was then sent to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 183, [5/23/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll183.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4323534/16); Public Law 113-28, [8/9/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-113publ28/pdf/PLAW-113publ28.pdf); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1911](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1911/all-actions)\]

-   **Before Bill, Federal Student Loan Rates Had Been Set At 3.4 Percent Since July, 2011, But Were Set To Rise To 6.8 Percent On July 1.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "In September 2007, Congress enacted the College Cost Reduction Act (PL 110-84), which overhauled federal student aid programs, primarily by reducing the federal subsidies paid to private lenders that offer federally backed student loans and redirecting the savings to enhance other student aid programs. Among other things, the law set fixed interest rates for federally subsidized, undergraduate student loans, which previously had been tied to economic factors and were increasing at the time. Specifically, interest rates on the popular Stafford loan programs were reduced for new loans, dropping to 6% on July 1, 2009, and gradually declining to 3.4% on July 1, 2011. The lower interest rates were initially set to expire July 1, 2012, and were supposed to increase to 6.8% for student loans originated on or after that date. To prevent that increase during the 2012 presidential campaign, Congress last year enacted the Interest Rate Reduction Act as part of the surface transportation authorization law. \[...\] The student loan provisions of that law extended the 3.4% interest rate for new, federally subsidized, undergraduate student loans for another year, through June 30, 2013." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4323534/16)\]

-   **Under House Bill And May 2013 Treasury Note Rate, The Interest Rate For Undergraduate Student Loans Issued In The Year After July 1, 2013 Would Be 4.31 Percent During Their First Year, And Then Would Change Each Later Year Depending On The Market Interest Rates At That Time.** According to Congressional Quarterly, the 10-year Treasury rate from the May 2013 auction was 1.81 percent. Therefore, the July 1 rate for subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans would be 4.31 percent, while the July 1 rate for graduate and parent PLUS loans would be 6.31 percent. Congressional Quarterly reported that under the House bill, "Rates each year would be determined on June 1, with the Treasury note rate being set by the most recent Treasury auction. Those rates would remain in effect for the 12-month period beginning on July 1." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4323534/16); Congressional Quarterly, [5/20/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4278606/13)\]

-   **April 2013: Obama Administration Proposed Changing System To Fixed Interest Rate Loans Set Based On Market Conditions When The Loan Is Issued.** According to the President's FY 2014 Budget, "Under current law, interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans are slated to rise this summer from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. At a time when the economy is still recovering and market interest rates remain low, the Budget proposes a cost-neutral reform to set interest rates so they more closely follow market rates, and to provide students with more affordable re-payment options. The rate on new loans would be set each year based on a market interest rate, which would remain fixed for the life of the loan so that student borrowers would have certainty about the rates they would pay. The Budget also expands repayment options to ensure that student borrowers do not have to pay more than 10 percent of their discretionary income on loan payments." \[Office of Management and Budget, [4/10/13](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2014/assets/education.pdf#page=5)\]

-   **Republicans Supportive Of Administration Proposal, But Democrats Opposed Due To Lack Of Interest Rate Cap.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "President Obama, as part of his FY 2014 budget, proposed returning student loan interest rates to a system of market-based variable rates tagged to 10-year Treasury notes. \[...\] Congressional Republicans expressed support for the concept, while Democrats generally were critical of the proposal because it failed to cap interest rates." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4323534/16)\]

-   **Obama Administration Threatened To Veto House Legislation Because Students Borrowing At Current Low Rates Could Not Be Certain That The Rate They Would Be Paying Would Stay Low Throughout The Life Of The Loan.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "While the Administration welcomes action by the House on this issue, H.R. 1911 is the wrong approach. First, the bill would not guarantee low rates for today\'s students. A rate that continues to vary after the loan has already been taken out would create uncertainty and lessen transparency for students and their families who are making decisions about borrowing for college. Second, the bill\'s changes would impose the largest interest rate increases on low- and middle-income students and families who struggle most to afford a college education. Third, the bill does not include the President\'s proposal to extend repayment options to borrowers who have already left school and often face the same debt burdens as current and future students. Finally, the Administration believes that student loan interest rates should not be raised to reduce the deficit. If the President were presented with this legislation in its current form, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill" (underline omitted). \[Office of Management and Budget, [5/22/13](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/113/saphr1911r_20130522.pdf)\]

### Payment Pause

**2023: Schweikert Voted For The Fiscal Responsibility Act Of 2023, Which Statutorily Ended The Pause On Student Loan Payments On August 29, 2023.** In May 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which would, in part, "statutorily end the pause on student loan repayments on Aug. 29, 2023." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 314 to 117, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate passed the bill, sent it to President Biden, and it was signed into law. \[House Vote 243, [5/31/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll243.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/243?24); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3746](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746/all-actions)\]

-   **The Packaged Codified Ending The Pause On Loan Payments First Paused By President Trump At The Beginning Of The COVID-19 Pandemic.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans had sought to block the student loan forgiveness in negotiations over raising the debt ceiling, but the agreement (HR 3746) the House passed on Wednesday did not deal with it. It did, however, codify ending a pause on loan payments first instituted by President Donald Trump at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The bipartisan agreement bars Biden from issuing another extension of the current pause, which is set to end by Sept. 1." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/1/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7759304?1)\]

-   **The Package Required Borrowers To Begin Paying Back Their Loans By The End Of Summer 2023, Which The Biden Administration Had Announced Previously.** According to CNN, "Under the package, borrowers will have to begin paying back their student loans at the end of the summer, as the Biden administration has already announced, according to a source familiar. The pause has been in effect since the Covid-19 pandemic began." \[CNN, [6/2/23](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/01/politics/senate-vote-debt-limit-latest/index.html)\]

### Refinancing Student Loans Interest Rates

**2014: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Allowing Borrowers To Refinance Their Outstanding Student Loans At Current Borrowing Rates Through December 11, 2014.** In September 2014, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment that, according to the Congressional Record, would have added the first two sections of H.R. 4582, the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act, to the underlying bill funding the government through December 11, 2014. According to a press release from one of that bill's sponsors, Rep. John Tierney (D-MA), "The Bank on Students Emergency Refinancing Act would allow student loan borrowers with public or private loans who borrowed before 2013 to refinance their loans to the lower market-based rates established for students last summer in the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013. Loans borrowed for undergraduate education would be refinanced to 3.86%; loans borrowed for graduate education would be refinanced to 5.41%; and loans borrowed by parents for their child's education would be refinanced to 6.41%." The proposed amendment would have sunset the student loan provisions on December 11, 2014. The vote was on a motion to recommit the bill and report it back with the specified amendment; the House rejected the motion by a vote of 199 to 228. \[House Vote 508, [9/17/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll508.xml); Congressional Record, [9/17/14](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2014/09/17/CREC-2014-09-17-pt1-PgH7637.pdf#page=24); H.J.Res. 124, [9/17/14](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-joint-resolution/124/text/172250); Tierney press release, [5/6/14](http://tierney.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tierney-miller-introduce-student-loan-refinancing-bill-to-help-make-paying); Congressional Actions, [H. J. Res. 124](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-joint-resolution/124/all-actions)\]

-   **Amendment Would Also Have Temporarily Raised The Minimum Wage To \$8.20 An Hour Until December 11, 2014, And Temporarily Enacted The Paycheck Fairness Act As Law Until That Same Date.** According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have added to the underlying bill "the text of a measure (HR 377) to tighten prohibitions on pay discrimination based on sex, \[and\] \[...\] the text of a measure (HR 1010) that would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to \$8.20 an hour, \$9.15 an hour after one year, and \$10.10 an hour after two years." According to the Congressional Record, the amendment would have sunset those two bills on December 11, 2014. \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/17/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/508); Congressional Record, [9/17/14](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2014/09/17/CREC-2014-09-17-pt1-PgH7637.pdf#page=24)\]

The rule limits eligibility for such loan forgiveness to borrowers with a maximum adjusted gross income of \$125,000, or \$250,000 for joint filers. The rule also extended, through the end of 2022, the suspension of student loan payments, the cessation of interest accrual and the suspension of involuntary loan collections. It allowed suspended loan payments during that period to count towards loan forgiveness or loan rehabilitation programs. The rule took effect on Oct. 12, 2022, but its loan forgiveness provisions have not been implemented pending legal challenges. Under the provisions of the joint resolution, the Education Department rule would have no force or effect, canceling the loan forgiveness program and reinstating loan payments and interest accrual that was suspended under the rule." The vote was on a veto override. The House failed to acquire a 2/3 majority and rejected the motion by a vote of 221 to 206, thus the veto was sustained. \[House Vote 277, [6/21/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll277.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/277?27); Congressional Actions, [H.J.

It allows businesses to immediately expense 100% of the cost of assets acquired and placed into service, and for small businesses it raises the Section 179 expensing limit to \$5 million for five years. It also establishes a 25% rate for a portion of pass-through business income that would otherwise have to be paid at the ordinary individual tax level, and for small businesses where an individual would receive less than \$150,000 in pass-through income it taxes the first \$75,000 of that income at a 9% rate."

Those taxpayers represent nearly 3 in 10 of the estimated 44 million Americans with student loan debt. Under current rules, borrowers can deduct up to \$2,500 in interest paid toward qualifying federal and private student loans. (See infographic below for some of the ins and outs.) It\'s an 'above-the-line' deduction on your Form 1040, meaning it directly reduces your taxable income --- and you don\'t need to itemize to claim it." \[CNBC, [11/2/17](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/02/student-loan-interest-deduction-is-on-the-chopping-block.html)\]

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Eliminate Federal Subsidies That Cover The Interest On Student Loans For Undergraduate Students While They Are In School.** In April 2014, Schweikert voted for the Republican Study Committee's proposed budget resolution for fiscal years 2015 to 2024. According to the Republican Study Committee, "Under current law, interest does not accrue for undergraduate students who take advantage of federal backed student loans. Meanwhile, recent reforms eliminated the in-school subsidy for graduate students. This budget proposes to also eliminate the in-school subsidy for undergraduate students, saving \$41 billion over the next decade."
