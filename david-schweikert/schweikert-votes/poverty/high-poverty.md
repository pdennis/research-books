# High-Poverty Areas

### Increased Share Of Federal Investments

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Requiring The Office Of Management And Budget To Implement Guidance To Raise The Share Of Federal Investments Targeted To Areas Of Persistent Poverty.** In May 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the Targeting Resources to Communities in Need Act of 2022, which would "require the Office of Management and Budget, within one year of enactment, to implement guidance to increase the share of federal investments targeted to areas of high and persistent poverty. It would specify that the guidance must include a minimum goal that such investments be in an amount greater than such areas would otherwise receive based on their portion of the U.S. population. It would also require the Census Bureau to publish a list of all areas of persistent poverty and update it annually; require OMB to submit an annual report to Congress on the programs under which federal funds were increased under the bill\'s provisions and the economic impact on the areas served; require the Government Accountability Office, within two years of enactment, to report to Congress on the effectiveness of the bill\'s provisions; and authorize \$5 million in fiscal 2023 for salaries and expenses to carry out the bill\'s provisions." The vote was on passage.
