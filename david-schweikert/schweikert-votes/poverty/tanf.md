# Temporary Assistance For Needy Families

### Work Requirements

**2023: Schweikert Voted For The Fiscal Responsibility Act Of 2023, Which Updated The Baseline For Calculating Certain State Workforce Participation Standards For The TANF Program And Established A Pilot Program For States To Create Work Benchmarks And Lower Assistance To Those Who Refuse To Comply With Work Requirements.** In May 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which would, in part, "update the baseline for calculating certain state workforce participation standards for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and provide for a pilot program for states to establish work outcome benchmarks and reduce assistance to beneficiaries who refuse to meet work requirements." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 314 to 117, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate passed the bill, sent it to President Biden, and it was signed into law. \[House Vote 243, [5/31/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll243.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/243?24); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3746](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746/all-actions)\]
