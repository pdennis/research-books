### Eliminating Funding For The Legal Services Corporation

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Recommend Eliminating The Legal Services Corporation As Part Of The FY 2016 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted for recommending eliminating the Legal Services Corporation. According to the Republican Study Committee, "Beginning in FY 2016, the LSC should be eliminated, saving the taxpayers \$375 million per year." The underlying budget resolution would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] for \$2.804 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2016, not including off-budget accounts. The substitute would call for reducing spending by \$7.1 trillion over 10 years compared to the Congressional Budget Office baseline." The vote was on the substitute amendment to a Budget Resolution. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 132 to 294. \[House Vote 138, [3/25/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll138.xml); Republican Study Committee, [FY 2016 Budget](http://rsc.flores.house.gov/files/Initiatives/rsc-budget.pdf); Congressional Quarterly, [3/25/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/138?23); Congress.gov, [H.
