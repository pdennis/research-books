### Repealing The Healthy Food Financing Initiative

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Repeal The Healthy Food Financing Initiative, Which Is Meant To Subsidize Businesses In Food Deserts, As Part Of The FY 2016 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted for repealing food financing initiatives. According to the Republican Study Committee, the budget proposes to "Repeal Food Financing Initiatives\[.\] The Healthy Food Financing Initiative should be repealed in FY 2016, saving \$22 million per year. This program is meant to subsidize businesses in so-called "food deserts" so that they can offer healthy food options through grants, loans, and educational programs. While it is important that Americans have access to healthy food options, there are already public and private programs at the federal, state, and local levels that can better serve these communities. Additionally, the federal government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers as to who gets subsidized and who does not receive federal dollars." The underlying budget resolution would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] for \$2.804 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2016, not including off-budget accounts. The substitute would call for reducing spending by \$7.1 trillion over 10 years compared to the Congressional Budget Office baseline." The vote was on the substitute amendment to a Budget Resolution. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 132 to 294. \[House Vote 138, [3/25/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll138.xml); Republican Study Committee, [FY 2016 Budget](http://rsc.flores.house.gov/files/Initiatives/rsc-budget.pdf); Congressional Quarterly, [3/25/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/138?23); Congress.gov, [H.
