# Community Development Loan Guarantees

### Funding

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Reduce Funding For Community Development Loan Guarantees As Part Of The FY 2016 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted for reducing funding for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and Community Development Loan Guarantees (CDLB). According to the Republican Study Committee, the budget proposes to "Reduce Funding for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and Community Development Loan Guarantees (CDLG)\[.\] This program has been unauthorized (yet still funded) for decades and is a prime example of the federal government's difficulty prioritizing local programs. CDBG has paid for programs as diverse as doggie daycare, a local circus, and decorative sidewalks in an affluent suburb. Beginning in FY 2016, CDBG and CDLG funding should be reduced." The underlying budget resolution would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] for \$2.804 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2016, not including off-budget accounts. The substitute would call for reducing spending by \$7.1 trillion over 10 years compared to the Congressional Budget Office baseline." The vote was on the substitute amendment to a Budget Resolution. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 132 to 294. \[House Vote 138, [3/25/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll138.xml); Republican Study Committee, [FY 2016 Budget](http://rsc.flores.house.gov/files/Initiatives/rsc-budget.pdf); Congressional Quarterly, [3/25/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/138?23); Congress.gov, [H.
