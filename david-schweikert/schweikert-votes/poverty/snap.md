# Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program

### Funding

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Providing \$140.4 Billion For The Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program.** In March 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the second portion of the Fiscal 2022 Omnibus Appropriations, which would "provide \$140.4 billion in mandatory spending for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program." The vote was on the motion to concur in the Senate amendment with a House amendment. The bill was divided and this vote was the second portion of the bill. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote of 260-171. After resolving differences, the bill was sent to the President and became law. \[House Vote 66, [3/9/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll066.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/9/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/66?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2471](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2471/actions)\]

-   **The Bill Provided \$26.9 Billion For Child Nutrition Programs.** According to CNN, "The bill would provide \$26.9 billion in funding for child nutrition programs, an increase of \$1.77 billion above what was approved for fiscal year 2021." \[CNN, [3/9/22](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/politics/government-omnibus-spending-bill-2022/index.html)\]

-   **The Bill Did Not Extend The Pandemic Waivers That Provided Additional Federal Funds To Schools And Helped With COVID-19 Outbreaks And Supply Chain And Labor Problems.** According to CNN, "However, the spending bill does not extend the pandemic waivers that provide schools with extra federal funds and increased flexibilities to cope with Covid-19 outbreaks, as well as supply chain and labor issues. A one-year extension of the waivers, which Congress originally approved in March 2020, would have cost \$11 billion." \[CNN, [3/9/22](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/politics/government-omnibus-spending-bill-2022/index.html)\]

-   **The Bill Included More Fruits And Vegetables Into The Special Supplemental Nutritional Program For Women, Infants, And Children Food Packages.** According to CNN, "The bill would also authorize funds so that more fruits and vegetables can be included in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children food packages." \[CNN, [3/9/22](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/politics/government-omnibus-spending-bill-2022/index.html)\]
