# Universal Service Fund

### End Subsidies To Mobile Voice And Data Services Under The Lifeline Program

**2016: Schweikert Voted To End Subsidies For Mobile Voice And Data Services Under The Lifeline Program.** In June 2016, Schweikert voted for legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "end\[ed\] subsidies for mobile voice and data service under the Federal Communications Commission's Lifeline program for low-income Americans." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill, which required a 2/3rd's majority or 234 affirmative votes for this bill. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 207 to 143. \[House Vote 334, [6/21/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll334.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/334?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5525](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5525/all-actions)\]

-   **The Lifeline Program, Part OF The Universal Service Fund, Provides Subsidies In Order To Promote Universal Telecommunication Access; The Low-Income Monthly Subsidy Of \$9.25 Is For Wireline Or Wireless Connectivity For Voice And Data Service.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Universal Service Fund (USF) was established to promote universal access to telecommunications services in the United States and is paid for by contributions from telecommunications providers based on an assessment of their interstate end-user revenues. The FCC permits, but does not require, this charge to be passed on directly to subscribers. The charge, however, cannot exceed the amount owed to the USF by the company.  The USF consists of four sub-funds, one of which is the low-income support fund known as Lifeline. This subsidy provides a monthly discount of \$9.25 for either wireline or wireless connectivity, for voice and data service, to those who qualify." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4912626/2?24)\]

-   **Program, Known Colloquially As The Obamaphone Program, Faced Fraud Allegations.** According to Washington Free Beacon, "Federal regulators were instructed to keep a massive fraud investigation -- concerning the 'Obamaphone' program, meant to help get low-income families cellphone access -- under wraps until a day after a controversial vote to expand the program, one of those regulators claims. The Federal Communications Commission on Friday announced that it would seek \$51 million in damages from a cellphone company that allegedly defrauded the federal Lifeline program of nearly \$10 million." \[Washington Free Beacon via Fox News, [4/14/16](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/14/fcc-kept-obamaphone-fraud-under-wraps-until-after-it-expanded-program.html)\]

-   **Program Was Created In 1985 And Expanded In 2005 To Include Prepaid Wireless Phone Service.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The program began in 1985 as a way to help cover increases in local phone service rates experienced by low-income consumers after the divestiture of AT&T. Under the program, companies provide discounts to low-income households for telephone service and are in turn supported by funds from the USF. In 2005, Lifeline subsidies became available for prepaid wireless phone service. \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4912626/2?24)\]

-   **2016: The Program Was Expanded To Include Broadband Services.** According to US News and World Report, "The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday voted 3 to 2 along party lines to expand the Lifeline phone subsidy to cover Internet access for low-income Americans, after a last minute decision broke a bipartisan compromise aimed at blocking wasteful welfare spending." \[US News and World Report, [3/31/16](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-03-31/fcc-expands-obamaphone-program-to-include-internet)\]
