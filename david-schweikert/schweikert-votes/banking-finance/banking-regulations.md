# Banking Regulations, Generally

### Swap Dealers

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Create Exemptions To The Banning Of Federal Bailouts For Swap Dealers.** In October 2013, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for "the bill that would amend a provision of the 2010 financial regulatory overhaul law that prohibits the federal bailout of swaps dealers or participants. The bill would exempt from the prohibition any covered depository institution that limits its security-based and other swap activities to hedging and other similar risk-mitigation activities. Non-structured and certain structured finance swap activities also would be exempt. Under the bill, insured depository institutions and uninsured U.S. branches of a foreign bank would be considered covered depository institutions." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 292 to 122. \[House Vote 569, [10/30/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll569.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/30/13](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2013/H/569?6); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 992](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/992/all-actions)\]
