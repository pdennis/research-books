### LGBTQ-Owned Business Loan Data

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Requiring Financial Institutions To Collect Data Regarding Loan Applications By LGBTQ-Owned Small Businesses, Which Would Facilitate Fair Lending Laws And Identify Needs And Opportunities For LGBTQ-Owned Businesses.** In June 2021, Schweikert voted against the LGBTQ Business Equal Credit Enforcement and Investment Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require financial institutions to solicit and maintain data regarding small business loan applications by LGBTQ-owned businesses, for the purpose of facilitating enforcement of fair lending laws and enabling communities, government entities and creditors to identify the needs of and opportunities for such businesses." The vote was on passage. The House failed to pass the bill by a vote of 248-177, failing to meet 2/3 of a vote, but passed the bill on June 24, 2021 by a vote of 252-176. \[House Vote 162, [6/15/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll162.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/15/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/162?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1443](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1443/actions)\]
