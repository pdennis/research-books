### Hiring Individuals With Minor Criminal Offenses

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Allowing Insured Depository Institutions To Hire Individuals Convicted Of Certain Minor Criminal Offenses, Offenses That Were Expunged, Or Low Risk Offenses.** In May 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the Fair Hiring in Banking Act, which would "modify banking regulatory law to allow insured depository institutions to hire individuals convicted for certain minor criminal offenses without approval from a federal regulator. Specifically, it would create exemptions from existing prohibitions on the hiring of individuals convicted of a criminal offense involving dishonesty, breach of trust or money laundering if they committed the offense at least seven years prior; were released from incarceration for the offense for at least five years prior; or committed the offense at age 21 or younger and were sentenced more than 30 months prior. It would also create exemptions for offenses that were expunged, sealed or dismissed, as well as de minimis offenses and 'low-risk' offenses such as the use of a fake ID, shoplifting, trespassing and fare evasion if at least one year has passed since conviction or entry into a pretrial diversion program. Among other provisions, it would require the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration to establish an application process for individuals and financial institutions to submit consent applications for offenses not covered by exemptions established by the bill and to consider an individual\'s criminal history, evidence of rehabilitation and scope of potential employment in reviewing such applications." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 329-88, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 156, [5/11/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll156.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/11/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/156?11); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5911](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5911/actions)\]
