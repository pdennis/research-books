# Financial Stability Oversight Council

### Credit Valuation Adjustment

**2013: Schweikert Was Absent During A Vote On Studying The Differences In Implementation Of The Credit Valuation Adjustment Requirement Between The U.S. And Other Countries.** In July 2013, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert missed a vote on the "motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill that would direct the Financial Stability Oversight Council to study the differences between the United States and other jurisdictions in implementing the derivatives credit valuation adjustment (CVA) capital requirement. The CVA is part of the Basel III agreement, which would establish higher capital requirements for banks. The study would address the effect on U.S. financial institutions, end users of derivatives and international derivatives markets." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 353 to 24. \[House Vote 305, [7/8/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll305.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/8/13](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2013/H/305?5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1341](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1341/all-actions)\]
