### Allowing HUD To Continue A Pilot Program For An Alternative Credit Rating To Help Determine Creditworthiness For Borrowers With Unsatisfactory History

**2016: Schweikert Voted Against Allowing HUD To Continue A Pilot Program For An Alternative Credit Rating To Help Determine Creditworthiness For Borrowers With Unsatisfactory History.** In February 2016, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "allow\[ed\] the Housing and Urban Development Department to continue a Federal Housing Administration pilot program for an automated process to provide alternative credit rating information to help determine creditworthiness of borrowers with insufficient credit histories." The underlying bill "modifie\[d\] various housing laws to try to extend affordable housing options to more low-income families" which later passed the House 427 to 0. The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 181 to 239. \[House Vote 51, [2/2/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll051.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/2/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/51?43); Congressional Quarterly, [1/29/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4825331?49&search=axBAwdBq); Congressional Actions, [H.
