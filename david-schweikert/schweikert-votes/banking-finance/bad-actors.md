# Bad Actors

### Disqualifying Financial Backers Of Terrorists From Benefiting From Regulatory Exemptions

**2015: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Disqualifying Anyone Convicted Or Providing Financial Assistance To Terrorist Organizations From Being Exempted From An Underlying Bill's Regulatory Exemptions.** In January 2015, Schweikert effectively voted against disqualifying anyone convicted or providing financial assistance to terrorist organizations from being exempted from an underlying bill's regulatory exemptions. According to Congressional Quarterly, the motion to recommit would have "disqualify\[ied\] anyone convicted of providing financial assistance to terrorist organizations or state sponsors of terrorism from the bill\'s regulatory exemptions." The underlying bill was the Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act which would have "modif\[ied\] numerous requirements under the 2010 financial regulatory overhaul." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 183 to 242. \[House Vote 36, [1/14/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll036.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/14/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/36?5); Congressional Quarterly, [1/14/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/37?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 37](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/37/all-actions)\]

-   **Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA): Amendment Would Use America's Economic Power To Combat Terrorism.** "History shows that leveraging America's economic strength is one of our Nation's best tools to combat the scourge of terrorism. We have forced rogue regimes like Iran to the negotiating table with strong economic sanctions. We have punished bad actors in Russia and North Korea by cutting off their access to global financial markets. And we ought to ensure that no one convicted of aiding and abetting terrorists, or state sponsors of terror, can take advantage of our financial system. That is what my amendment does. It simply makes clear that no one who has been convicted of providing assistance, either directly or indirectly, to a terrorist organization or a state sponsor of terrorism can make use of the exemptions in the underlying bill." \[Congressional Record, [1/14/15](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2015/01/14/CREC-2015-01-14-pt1-PgH394.pdf)\]

-   **Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-KS): Bad Actor Provisions Already Exist In Current Law.** In a floor speech, Rep. Hensarling said, "I suppose I have some good news for the gentleman who offered it, and that is there are numerous bad actor provisions already within our Federal securities law. So, with the possible exception of the unconstitutional power grab of our President in granting amnesty and possibly allowing new bad actors to enter our country, I think that the motion to recommit is probably largely irrelevant." \[Congressional Record, [1/14/15](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2015/01/14/CREC-2015-01-14-pt1-PgH394.pdf)\]
