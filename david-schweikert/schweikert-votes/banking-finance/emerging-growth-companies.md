-   **Congress Previously Created A New Category of Issues Of Initial Public Offerings Called EGCs, Purpose Was to Promote Small Business.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) among other things created a new category of issuers of initial public offerings (IPOs) called 'emerging growth companies' (EGCs), and removed or reduced some of the SEC reporting and regulatory requirements for IPOs once the company is publicly traded. The goal of the JOBS Act was to promote small business; small businesses have been credited with leading job formation during economic recoveries, and when small businesses need a cash influx in order to grow they often raise this capital by going public and selling stock." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/5/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4597552/5?5&search=V4dJCHNb)\]

According to Congressional Quarterly, "This bill modifies numerous requirements under Dodd-Frank and other financial services laws in an effort to reduce the impact of those laws on certain entities and spur business growth. Among its provisions, it exempts certain end users of derivatives from margin calls and allows issuers of securities to submit a disclosures report aimed at increasing investor comprehension. It also exempts certain entities from Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registration requirements, and includes several provisions to help emerging growth companies raise capital and grow. \[...\] The bill includes provisions to help further promote emerging growth companies \[...\] The bill exempts Emerging Growth Companies (EGCs) and companies with annual revenues of less than \$250 million from having to use XBRL standards for filing financial statements with the SEC. EGCs would remain exempt from the requirement as long as they are EGCs, while other companies would be exempt for five years after enactment or two years after the SEC determines that the benefits of XBRL outweigh the costs." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill, which required a two-thirds majority to succeed. The House rejected the bill by a vote of 276 to 146. The bill later came up for a vote and passed the House 271 to 154.

-   **Provision Would Also Require The SEC To Report To Congress The Costs And Benefits Of Using XBRL.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Under the measure, the SEC must report to Congress within a year of enactment on the costs and benefits of using XBRL and how those costs and benefits may differ because of the size of the reporting company. The SEC's analysis must include the costs of submitting the data to the SEC in XBRL, posting the data on the website, the necessary software and any additional consulting services. The analysis of benefits must include the SEC\'s improved ability to monitor securities markets, assess potential outcomes of regulatory alternatives, enhance investor participation in corporate governance and promote capital formation. The report must also include the progress in implementing XBRL and the use of XBRL data and the effectiveness of U. S. standards for filing interactive data compared with international counterparts." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/5/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4597552/5?5&search=V4dJCHNb)\]

Prior to the issuer distributing a preliminary prospectus to investors, the issuer must amend the registration statement to include all required financial information, \[...\] an issuer that was designated as an EGC when it filed a registration statement but has since ceased to fall under that classification would still be treated as an EGC for a year following the change of status, \[...\] \[and this\] bill also reduces, from 21 days to 15 days, the length of time an EGC must have a confidential registration statement on file with the SEC before presenting its securities to buyers."
