-   **Many Republicans Opposed The National Apprenticeship Act Of 2020 Due To President Trump's Industry Recognized Apprenticeship Programs Being Left Out Of The Legislation.** According to SHRM, "While expanding apprenticeships has bipartisan support, the main sticking point for Republicans opposing the legislation is the rejection of funding for President Donald Trump\'s Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs (IRAPs). The IRAP system was established this year to exist alongside the DOL-regulated system. The model is meant to encourage industries to participate in work-based learning programs by turning over recognition and oversight of the programs to third parties, such as businesses, trade groups, nonprofits and unions." \[SHRM, [11/30/20](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/house-approves-apprenticeship-overhaul.aspx)\]

Among other provisions, it would authorize all programs at lower amounts; modify requirements related to state planning of apprenticeship programs, including to eliminate certain requirements for federal oversight and requirements that funding be used for alignment with state workforce and education activities; and strike requirements for establishment of a Labor Department advisory committee on apprenticeships and an interagency agreement with the Education Department to support the integration of apprenticeship and educational programs." The vote was on adoption.

The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 175-245. \[House Vote 30, [2/5/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll030.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/5/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/30?33); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 9](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/117th-congress/house-amendment/9/actions?r=1&s=a); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 447](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/447/actions)\]
