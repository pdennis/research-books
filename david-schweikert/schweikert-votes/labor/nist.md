# National Institutes Of Standards And Technology

### Construction Safety Investigations

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Expand The Authorities Of The National Institute Of Standards And Technology Safety Teams Regarding Investigations Of Construction.** In May 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would amend the 2002 National Construction Safety Team Act to expand the authority of National Institute of Standards and Technology safety teams to also investigate failures of infrastructure and other non-building structures. It would allow NIST to deploy response teams to investigate the failure of a structure or structures that resulted in substantial loss of life or that posed significant potential for substantial loss of life. It also would authorize teams to recommend improvements to engineering codes and standards. It would require NIST, when deploying a response team, to coordinate with federal, state and local entities that may conduct their own research on structural failures due to windstorms. NIST construction safety teams are already required to coordinate with such entities that research and investigate earthquake damage. The bill would not authorize any funding, nor would it authorize criminal investigations or investigations that would lead to enforcement actions." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 358 to 41. \[House Vote 195, [5/8/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll195.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/8/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/195/?45); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4143](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4143/all-actions)\]
