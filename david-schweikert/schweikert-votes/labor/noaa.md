# National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration

### Recruitment And Retention

**2020: Schweikert Voted Against The National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps Amendments Act Of 2020, Which Included Guidelines For Recruitment, Expanding Benefits, Establishing A Student Loan Repayment Program, And Updating Sexual Assault And Harassment Investigation Procedures.** In December 2020, Schweikert voted against the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps Amendments Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "outline numerous requirements for the recruitment, retention, promotion, and training of NOAA Corps officers. It would extend certain benefits and requirements in place for other uniformed services to NOAA Corps, including policies related to employment and reemployment rights, housing and personal spending allowances, and mental health services. It would authorize NOAA to establish a student loan repayment program and an educational assistance program for active and pre-commission officers, and to establish a career flexibility program allowing officers to take temporary leaves of absence. Among other provisions, it would update requirements for NOAA response to reports of sexual harassment and sexual assault at the agency, including to require thorough and prompt investigation of all such allegations. It would extend to 2030 NOAA authority to enter into transaction agreements to carry out research related to data and satellite systems, and it would require NOAA to enter into at least two contracts for charting and survey services by vessels, particularly in the Arctic." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 265-124 and sent it to the President and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 233, [12/4/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll233.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/4/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/233?7); Congressional Actions, [S. 2981](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2981/actions)\]

-   **The NOAA Corps Amendments Act Of 2020 Increased Their Number Of Officers To 500, Expanded Benefits, Enhanced Recruitment And Retainment Of Officers, And Increased Diversity In The Workforce.** According to the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps Amendments Act of 2020 authorizes the NOAA Corps to adjust the number of officers, as needed and funded, from 321 to a maximum of 500. It also expands some benefits to NOAA Corps officers to align them better with the other uniformed services, and includes provisions that will enhance NOAA's ability to recruit and retain officers, and increase diversity in the workforce." \[Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, [12/23/20](https://www.omao.noaa.gov/find/media/articles/2020-12-23/noaa-commissioned-officer-corps-gets-big-boost-reauthorization-legislation)\]
