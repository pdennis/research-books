# Workplace Violence Prevention

### Healthcare Employers

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Requiring All Healthcare Employers And Healthcare-Related Employers To Implement Workplace Violence Prevention Plans.** In April 2021, Schweikert voted against the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require health care and social service industry employers to develop and implement comprehensive workplace violence prevention plans. It would require the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to issue a final standard for such plans, based on 2015 OSHA guidelines, within 42 months of enactment and require employers to develop and implement such plans within six months of the final standard being issued. It would require workplace violence prevention plans to include certain procedures for reporting, responding to, and mitigating risks of incidents of workplace violence, including for employers to investigate and take corrective actions in response to violent incidents. It would require employers to investigate any workplace violence incident, risk, or hazard 'as soon as practicable.' It would also require employers to develop and implement plans with participation from employees and employee representatives; provide annual training to employees exposed to workplace violence hazards and risks; and maintain records related to workplace violence plans, incidents, and response for at least five years. The bill\'s provisions would apply to employers of individuals working in most health care facilities, including hospitals, nursing homes, and drug abuse treatment centers, as well as employers of individuals providing related services, including home-based health care or social work and emergency services." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 254-166.
