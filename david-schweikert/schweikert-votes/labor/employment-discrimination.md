# Employment Discrimination

**2015: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against An Amendment That Would Prevent The Underlying Bill's Sanctions On Frivolous Lawsuit From Applying To Employment Discrimination Laws.** In September 2015, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "state\[d\] that the measure would not apply to actions brought under employment discrimination laws." The underlying measure was legislation that was designed to decrease frivolous lawsuits by instituting sanctions on parties that file frivolous civil lawsuits. The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 179 to 239. \[House Vote 500, [9/17/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll500.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/17/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/500?40); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 758](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/758/all-actions)\]
