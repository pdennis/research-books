### Disclosure Of Employees Location

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against Making It More Difficult For Publicly Traded Companies To Hide Offshoring Jobs.** In October 2019, Schweikert voted against a bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require publicly traded companies to disclose the total number and percentage of their employees who are based in each state, U.S. territory, and foreign country. It would require such information disclosed to be disaggregated by state, territory, or country and to include percentage changes from the company\'s last annual report. It would exempt small and new 'emerging growth' companies from the bill\'s disclosure requirements. It would authorize SEC rulemaking authority to implement the bill\'s provisions." The vote was passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 226-184. The bill was never taken up in the Senate. \[House Vote 567, [10/18/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll567.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/18/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/567?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R.3624](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3624/all-actions)\]

### Tax Breaks For Companies That Outsource American Jobs

**2014: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Providing A Tax Credit To Companies That Return Overseas Jobs To The U.S., And Against Prohibiting Companies That Move U.S. Jobs Overseas From Deducting The Move Costs From Their Taxes.** In September 2014, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would \[have\] allow\[ed\] businesses to claim a tax credit of up to 20 percent of expenses related to returning American jobs from overseas. It would \[have\] den\[ied\] tax deductions for the costs of sending American jobs overseas. It also would \[have\] prohibit\[ed\] U.S. companies from reincorporating overseas through an inversion if the combined foreign entity is managed and controlled in the U.S. and conducts a significant percentage of its business activities in the U.S. It also would \[have\] den\[ied\] the tax benefits in the \[underlying\] bill to inverted corporations." The underlying bill, according to a separate Congressional Quarterly article, was a package of 15 bills that had already passed the House. Its "numerous tax provisions\[\] includ\[e\] those to repeal the 2.3% medical device tax included in the 2010 health care overhaul, and to make permanent the current ban on state and local taxation of Internet access, the research and development tax credit, the 50% depreciation rules for businesses and increased expensing limits for small businesses and farms, as well as certain rules for S-Corporations." The amendment would have also required the House to consider several proposed pieces of legislation, including a minimum wage increase; the Paycheck Fairness Act; a student loan program allowing those with loans to refinance them at current interest rates, paid for with a so-called "Buffet Tax;" and a paid family sick leave requirement. The vote was on a motion to recommit the underlying bill and report it back with the specified amendment; the House rejected the motion by a vote of 191 to 218. \[House Vote 512, [9/18/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll512.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/15/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/512); Congressional Quarterly, [6/11/14](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4547314/37); [Congressional Record](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4493636), 9/18/14; [Tierney press release](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2014/09/18/CREC-2014-09-18-pt1-PgH7854-3.pdf), 5/6/14; [CRS Summary of H.R. 1286](http://tierney.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tierney-miller-introduce-student-loan-refinancing-bill-to-help-make-paying), 3/20/13; [Congressional Actions](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1286/), H.R. 4\]
