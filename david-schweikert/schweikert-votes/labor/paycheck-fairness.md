The House adopted the motion, thereby defeating the Democratic alternative, by a vote of 240 to 183. \[House Vote 154, [4/15/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll154.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/15/15](http://cq.com/vote/2015/H/154?5); Democratic Leader, [Accessed 8/25/17](http://www.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/114th-congress-previous-questions/); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1619](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1619/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 622](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/622/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1105](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1105/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1195](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1195/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Voting Down A Previous Question Allows The Minority Party To Decide What Amendments Are To Be Considered.** According to the Democratic Leader, "Defeating the previous question gives the minority party the opportunity to decide what bill or amendments the House will consider. When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he or she then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment. In essence, defeat of the previous question gives the minority party control of the floor and of the schedule for the U.S. House of Representatives, pertaining to the Rule that is being debated." \[Democratic Leader, [Accessed 4/17/17](http://www.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/115th-congress-previous-questions/)\]

**2015: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against The Paycheck Fairness Act.** In April 2015, Schweikert voted for a motion to order the previous question that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "end\[ed\] debate and possibility of amendment) on adoption of the rule (H Res 189) to provide for House floor consideration of the bill to exclude insurance paid at closing into escrow, as well as fees paid to lender-affiliated companies, from the three percent limit on points and fees imposed on qualified mortgages by redefining 'points and fees' under the Truth in Lending Act. It also would provide for floor consideration of the bill to modify federal rules regarding high-cost-mortgages as they apply to manufactured housing. The rule also would take the fiscal 2016 Senate budget resolution from the Speaker's table, adopt a substitute amendment consisting of the text of the fiscal 2016 House budget resolution, as adopted by the House, and would adopt the concurrent resolution, as amended." According to the House Democratic Leader, "Democrats' PQ would force a vote on: The Opioid Abuse Crisis Act, which provides \$600 million in fully paid-for vital new resources to address the opioid epidemic that kills 78 Americans every day; and The DISCLOSE Act, which would bring desperately needed transparency to the enormous amounts of special interest secret money unleashed by the Supreme Court's wildly destructive Citizens United decision." The vote was on the motion to order the previous question. The House adopted the motion, thereby defeating the Democratic alternative, by a vote of 239 to 183. \[House Vote 148, [4/14/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll148.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/14/15](http://cq.com/vote/2015/H/148?4); Democratic Leader, [Accessed 8/25/17](http://www.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/114th-congress-previous-questions/); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1619](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1619/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 650](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/650/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 685](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/685/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [S.

### 2017

**2017: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Considering The Paycheck Fairness Act.** In April 2017, Schweikert voted for a motion to order the previous question on, according to Congressional Quarterly, "the rule (H Res 240) that would provide for House floor consideration of the bill that would direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to increase from \$5 million to \$10 million the annual amount of securities that privately-held companies can sell for employee compensation without needing to disclose certain information to investors." In addition, according to the office of Nancy Pelosi, "the Democratic previous question would amend the rule to allow for consideration of H.R. 1869, to address the male to female income disparity in the united states and make equal pay for women a reality in the workplace." The vote was the previous question. The House adopted the motion by a vote of 229 to 187. \[House Vote 213, [4/4/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll213.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/4/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/213?0); Democratic Leader, [Accessed 3/27/18](https://www.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/115th-congress-previous-questions/); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1869](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1869/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1343](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1343/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.

### 2019

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against The Paycheck Fairness Act, Which Aims To End Gender-Based Wage Discrimination By Banning Employees From Asking About Previous Salary, Close Rules Allowing Firms To Fire Workers Who Discuss Pay, And Require Employers Publish Data With The EEOC.** In March 2019, Schweikert voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act. According to Vox, the legislation "works to close loopholes in the landmark Equal Pay Act of 1963, which required that men and women receive equal pay for equal work. \[...\] DeLauro's Paycheck Fairness Act tries to push back on lingering inequity in three key ways. Perhaps most importantly, it would ban employers from asking candidates how much they made in previous jobs. It would also get rid of employer rules that keep workers from talking about their salary information, so that women could ask how much their coworkers are making and find out if they're underpaid. Third, the bill would require employers to be much more transparent about how much they're paying workers. Employers would have to share salary data with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, so that body could watch out for potential discriminatory practices." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 242 to 187. \[House Vote 134, [3/27/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll134.xml); Vox, [3/27/19](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/27/18282775/paycheck-fairness-act-gender-pay-gap-pelosi); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7/all-actions)\]

-   **On Average, Women Make Only 80 Cents To The Dollar That Men Earn, With Women Of Color Earning Even Less.** According to Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD), "Too often, women are paid less than men for doing the exact same work. House Democrats passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009 to strengthen worker protections against pay discrimination, but additional action is required to help close the wage gap. On average, a woman still makes only 80 cents for every dollar earned by her white male equivalent. The wage gap varies based on race and is especially acute for women of color: Black women earn 61 cents on average for every dollar earned by her white male equivalent; Latina women earn 53 cents; Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women earn 62 cents; And Asian women earn 85 cents." \[Press Release From The Office Of Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, [3/26/19](https://www.majorityleader.gov/content/hr7-paycheck-fairness-act)\]
