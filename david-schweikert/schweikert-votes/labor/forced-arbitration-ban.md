# Prohibiting Forced Arbitration

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Prohibiting Contracts That Would Require A Future Employment, Consumer, Antitrust, Or Civil Rights Dispute To Be Resolved Through Forced Arbitration.** In March 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act of 2022, which would "prohibit the enforcement of predispute arbitration agreements that would require a future employment, consumer, antitrust or civil rights dispute to be resolved through arbitration. It would also prohibit the enforcement of predispute joint-action waivers that would interfere with an individual\'s right to participate in a collective action with respect to such disputes. It would permit the voluntary use of arbitration after a dispute arises; require federal courts, not arbitrators, to determine the applicability of the bill\'s provisions to a contract." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 222-209. \[House Vote 81, [3/17/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll081.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/17/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/81?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 963](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/963/actions)\]

-   **The Bill Exempted Collective Bargaining Agreements From The Forced Arbitration Prohibition As Long As The Agreements Would Not Waive A Worker's Right To Seek Judicial Enforcement Of A Right.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "specify that the bill's provisions would not apply to arbitration provisions in collective bargaining agreements between an employer and a labor organization or between labor organizations, as long as such agreements do not effectively waive an employee's right to seek judicial enforcement of a right arising under existing federal or state law." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/17/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/81?7)\]

-   **The Bill Would Nullify All Pre-Dispute Mandatory Arbitration Agreements In Future Disputes In Employment, Consumer, Antitrust, Civil Rights, And Others.** According to Bloomberg Law, "The U.S. House passed a bill that would void all pre-dispute mandatory arbitration agreements in employment, antitrust, consumer, and other matters, following on the heels of a new law that specifically banned the agreements for #MeToo allegations." \[Bloomberg Law, [3/17/22](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/u-s-house-passes-bill-banning-mandatory-arbitration-agreements)\]

-   **Supporters Of The Bill Argued It Was "Tricky" To Oppose Forced Arbitration For Allegations Of Sexual Assault And Harassment While Enabling Forced Arbitration For Race Discrimination Or Unequal Pay Disputes.** According to Bloomberg Law, "Backers of the broader bill said it's tricky to say arbitration is harmful for workers alleging sexual harassment but acceptable for those alleging race discrimination or unequal pay. Opponents say the new #MeToo law is vastly different from the FAIR Act." \[Bloomberg Law, [3/17/22](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/u-s-house-passes-bill-banning-mandatory-arbitration-agreements)\]

-   **The White House Supported The Bill, Arguing That Forced Arbitration Allow Companies To Conceal Their Wrongdoing From Consumers Deciding Between Products And Workers Who May Be Choosing Between Employment.** According to Bloomberg Law, "The White House endorses the act, saying such provisions conceal 'companies' wrongdoing from other consumers who are choosing between products and workers who are deciding between jobs.'" \[Bloomberg Law, [3/17/22](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/u-s-house-passes-bill-banning-mandatory-arbitration-agreements)\]

-   **The White House Argued That The Elimination Of Forced Arbitration Would Incentive Employers To Prevent And Fix Issues In The Workplace And Business Practices.** According to Bloomberg Law, "'Eliminating the use of these clauses would increase incentives for employers to prevent and remedy problems in the workplace and in their business practices,' the White House said in a March 15 statement of administration policy said." \[Bloomberg Law, [3/17/22](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/u-s-house-passes-bill-banning-mandatory-arbitration-agreements)\]
