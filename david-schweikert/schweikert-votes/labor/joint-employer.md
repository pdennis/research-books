# Joint Employer

### Obama-Era Joint-Employer Rule

**2017: Schweikert Voted To Overturn An Obama-Era Joint Employer Rule That Said A Subcontractor Was An Employee If The Firm Had Indirect Control Over The Employee.** In November 2017, Schweikert voted for legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "define\[d\] a joint employer as an entity with actual, direct and immediate control over employees, with significant control over essential terms of employment such as hiring, determining pay and benefits, day-to-day supervision of employees, and assigning individual work schedules." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 242 to 181. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 614, [11/7/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll614.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/7/17](http://www.cq.com/vote/2017/H/614?22); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3441](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3441/all-actions)\]

-   **Obama NLRB Created A Rule That Defined A Joint-Employer As Any Firm That Had Indirect Control Over The Employee Or "Reserved The Authority To Do So."** According to The Hill, "The House on Tuesday evening passed a bill that would overturn an Obama-era National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruling that made companies potentially liable for labor law violations committed by their subcontractors. \[...\] Republicans say the activist labor board under the Obama administration created massive confusion when it ruled in 2015 that an employer is considered a joint employer with a subcontractor if it has 'indirect' control over the terms and conditions of employment or has the 'reserved authority to do so.'" \[The Hill, [11/7/17](http://thehill.com/regulation/labor/359232-house-passes-bill-to-overturn-controversial-joint-employer-ruling)\]
