# Workplace Accommodations

### Breastfeeding Accommodations

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2023 Omnibus Spending Package, Which Included Requirements For All Employers To Provide Breastfeeding Workplace Accommodations.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against concurring with the Senate amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, which would "include provisions to address flexibility for state and local coronavirus relief funding, use of Russian asset seizures for Ukraine aid, breastfeeding workplace accommodations, compensation for 9/11 victims, aviation preparedness, ocean and land conservation programs, consumer protections, pesticide safety and lobster fishing regulations." The vote was on a motion to concur. The House concurred with the Senate amendment by a vote of 225-201, thus bill was sent to President Biden and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 549, [12/23/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll549.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/23/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/549?2); Congressional Actions, [S.Amdt. 6552](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/117th-congress/senate-amendment/6552/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2617](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617/all-actions)\]

-   **Added To The Omnibus As An Amendment, The Breastfeeding Accommodations Provision Mandated Employers To Provide A Designated Breastfeeding Location Other Than A Restroom And Provide A "Reasonable Break Time" To Breastfeed.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The original bill (S 1658) would mandate that employers provide nursing workers with a designated breastfeeding space other than a bathroom as well as 'reasonable break time' to breastfeed, lasting for up to a year after the child's birth. The amendment, which was subject to a 60-vote threshold, was approved 92-5. The Senate later voted 68-29 to pass the omnibus spending bill (HR 2617), paving the way for the House to clear the legislation ahead of government spending (PL 117-229) running out at midnight on Friday." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/22/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7629178?1)\]

-   **The Provision Exempted Airlines From The Breastfeeding Accommodation Mandate And State Accommodation Mandates And Provided Some Protections To The Rail Industry, Including Not Requiring Them To Retrofit Rail Cars.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "But the final text includes language that would exempt airlines both from providing crew members with in-flight breastfeeding accommodations and from state laws mandating such accommodations. The rail industry, which also expressed concerns with language in the bill in the past, is not completely exempt from the mandates, but has some protections such as not having to retrofit rail cars." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/22/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7629178?1)\]

-   **The FY 2023 Omnibus Included A Provision That Guaranteed Workplace Accommodations For Nursing Workers To Pump Their Breastmilk.** According to CNN, "Also, another provision in the package guarantees workplace accommodations -- particularly time to pump -- for more nursing workers." \[CNN, [12/29/22](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/politics/spending-bill-congress-omnibus/index.html)\]

It will prevent them from being forced to take leave or losing their jobs, as well as bar employers from denying employment opportunities to women based on their need for reasonable accommodations due to childbirth or related medical conditions." \[CNN, [12/29/22](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/politics/spending-bill-congress-omnibus/index.html)\]
