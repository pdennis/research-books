# Equal Pay

### Bona-Fide Factors

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Limiting An Employer's Legal Defense In Pay Discrimination Lawsuits, Which Would Require Employers To Justify A Pay Difference Based On Bona Fide Job-Related Factors Instead Of Just Based On A Factor Other Than Sex.** In April 2021, Schweikert voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "narrow the legal defense an employer may use in a lawsuit alleging pay discrimination on the basis of sex. Specifically, it would require employers to demonstrate that a difference in pay between employees is based on a business-related 'bona fide factor other than sex, such as education, training, or experience' as opposed to being based on 'any factor other than sex.'" The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 217-210. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 108, [4/15/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll108.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/15/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/108?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7/actions)\]

-   **The Bill Would Close Federal Equal Pay Law Loopholes.** According to Courthouse News Service, "Breathing new life into legislation that died in the Senate under the Trump administration, Democrats on Tuesday advanced a bill they say would close lingering loopholes in federal equal pay laws on the books for nearly 60 years." \[Courthouse News Service, [4/13/21](https://www.courthousenews.com/democrats-renew-push-for-equal-pay-legislation/)\]

-   **According To The National Women's Law Center, White Women Are Paid An Average Of 82 Cents For Every Dollar Men Are Paid.** According to Courthouse News Service, "According to a 2020 study from the National Women's Law Center, white women who work full time year-round are on average paid just 82 cents for every dollar paid to men." \[Courthouse News Service, [4/13/21](https://www.courthousenews.com/democrats-renew-push-for-equal-pay-legislation/)\]

-   **According To The National Women's Law Center, Black Women Are Paid An Average Of 63 Cents For Every Dollar Men Are Paid.** According to Courthouse News Service, "For Black women, the disparity is drastically worse at 63 cents." \[Courthouse News Service, [4/13/21](https://www.courthousenews.com/democrats-renew-push-for-equal-pay-legislation/)\]

-   **According To The National Women's Law Center, For Every Dollar Men Are Paid, Native American Women Are Paid An Average Of 60 Cents And Latinas Are Paid An Average Of 55 Cents.** According to Courthouse News Service, "while Native American women earn just 60 cents and Latina women earn only 55 cents." \[Courthouse News Service, [4/13/21](https://www.courthousenews.com/democrats-renew-push-for-equal-pay-legislation/)\]

-   **According To The U.S. Census Bureau, Asian American Pacific Islander Women Earned An Average Of 85 Cents For Every Dollar Men Earned In 2019.** According to Courthouse News Service, "Only Asian American Pacific Islander women came close to earning as much as men did in 2019, taking home nearly 85 cents to ever dollar, according to the study based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau." \[Courthouse News Service, [4/13/21](https://www.courthousenews.com/democrats-renew-push-for-equal-pay-legislation/)\]

-   **Republicans Argued The Bill Would Cause A Wave Of New Lawsuits.** According to Courthouse News Service, "Republicans claimed a surge of new lawsuits would come if the bill were made into law." \[Courthouse News Service, [4/13/21](https://www.courthousenews.com/democrats-renew-push-for-equal-pay-legislation/)\]

-   **The Bill Would Expand The Standards Employers Must Meet In Order To Justify Pay Gaps Were Not Based On Gender Discrimination.** According to Courthouse News Service, "The legislation raises the legal standards businesses must meet in order to claim any pay gaps aren't based on discrimination." \[Courthouse News Service, [4/13/21](https://www.courthousenews.com/democrats-renew-push-for-equal-pay-legislation/)\]

-   **National Right To Life Warned That The Paycheck Fairness Act Could Be Construed To Mandate Employers To Cover Elective Abortions With Their Health Benefits.** According to the Scorecard Letter on H.R. 7 from National Right To Life, "While the legislation is meant to address potential discrimination regarding the gender pay gap, the legislation contains language that could be construed to require employers to cover elective abortion in their healthcare benefits." \[Scorecard Letter On H.R. 7 -- National Right To Life, [6/8/21](https://www.nrlc.org/federal/ahc/nrlc-scorecard-letter-on-h-r-7-paycheck-fairness-act/)\]

-   **Since H.R. 7 Changed The Definition Of "Sex" To Include "Pregnancy, Childbirth, Or A Related Medical Condition" Without Preventing Funding For Abortion, National Right To Life Claimed That H.R. 7 Could Be Used To Sue Employers That Refuse To Provide Elective Abortion Coverage.** According to the Scorecard Letter on H.R. 7 from National Right To Life, "H.R. 7 makes definitional changes to 'sex' to include 'pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition.' It is well established that abortion will be regarded as a 'related medical condition.' See 29 C.F.R. pt. 1604 App. (1986) and Doe v. CARS Protection Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 358 (3d Cir. 2008). Historically, when Congress has addressed discrimination based on sex, rules of construction have been added to prevent requiring funding of abortion. Since there is no rule of construction that would make this legislation abortion-neutral, it is likely that H.R. 7 could be used to sue employers for a lack of elective abortion coverage." \[Scorecard Letter On H.R. 7 -- National Right To Life, [6/8/21](https://www.nrlc.org/federal/ahc/nrlc-scorecard-letter-on-h-r-7-paycheck-fairness-act/)\]

-   **National Right To Life Warned That Under The Paycheck Protection Act, If An Employer Provides Male-Specific Health Coverage, A Person Could Claim Discrimination If The Employer Failed To Provide Abortion Coverage.** According to the Scorecard Letter on H.R. 7 from National Right To Life, "Under H.R. 7, if an employer provides health coverage for male-specific items, a person could make a claim that an employer's failure to provide health coverage for abortion is discriminatory." \[Scorecard Letter On H.R. 7 -- National Right To Life, [6/8/21](https://www.nrlc.org/federal/ahc/nrlc-scorecard-letter-on-h-r-7-paycheck-fairness-act/)\]

The legislation would also make it more difficult for employers to avoid \[Equal Pay Act\] EPA liability, and proposed safeguards would protect employees from retaliation for making inquiries or disclosures concerning employee wages and for filing a charge or participating in any manner in EPA proceedings. In short, while this legislation would adhere to current equal work standards of the EPA, it would reform the procedures and remedies for enforcing the law."

The vote was on a motion to recommit the bill and report it back with the specified amendment; the House rejected the motion by a vote of 199 to 228. \[House Vote 508, [9/17/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll508.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/17/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/508); H.R. 377, [1/23/13](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/377/text); CRS Report #RL31867, [11/22/13](http://www.cq.com/pdf/crsreports-4387763); H.J.Res. 124, [9/17/14](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-joint-resolution/124/text/172250); Congressional Record, [9/17/14](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2014/09/17/CREC-2014-09-17-pt1-PgH7637.pdf#page=24); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Amendment Would Also Have Raised The Minimum Wage To \$8.20 An Hour Until December 11, 2014, And Allowed Student Loans To Be Refinanced At Current Borrowing Rates Until That Date.** According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have added "the text of a measure (HR 1010) that would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to \$8.20 an hour, \$9.15 an hour after one year, and \$10.10 an hour after two years; \[...\] \[and\] allow\[ed\] student loan debt to be refinanced at rates available to current borrowers." The proposed amendment would have sunset the minimum wage and student loan refinancing provisions on December 11, 2014. \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/17/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/508); Congressional Record, [9/17/14](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2014/09/17/CREC-2014-09-17-pt1-PgH7637.pdf#page=24)\]

-   **Amendment Would Also Have Reauthorized The Export-Import Bank For Five Years Instead Of Nine Months.** According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment "would \[also have\] extend\[ed\] the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank for 5 years." The underlying bill included a provision reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank through June 30, 2015. \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/17/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/508); H.J.Res. 124, [9/17/14](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-joint-resolution/124/text/172250)\]

**2013: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Considering The Paycheck Fairness Act, Which Would Make It Easier For Women To Successfully Sue Over Pay Discrimination, And Increase Employer Penalties In Such Cases.** In April 2013, Schweikert effectively voted to block House consideration of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which, according to the Congressional Research Service, would "increase penalties for employers who pay different wages to men and women for 'equal work,' and would add programs for training, research, technical assistance, and pay equity employer recognition awards. The legislation would also make it more difficult for employers to avoid \[Equal Pay Act\] EPA liability, and proposed safeguards would protect employees from retaliation for making inquiries or disclosures concerning employee wages and for filing a charge or participating in any manner in EPA proceedings. In short, while this legislation would adhere to current equal work standards of the EPA, it would reform the procedures and remedies for enforcing the law." The vote was on ordering the previous question -- and preventing further amendment of -- the proposed rule governing House consideration of a bill concerning the National Labor Relations Board. Because the un-amended rule did not permit consideration of the Paycheck Fairness Act, the effect of the House's 226 to 192 vote to order the previous question on the rule was to block House consideration of Paycheck Fairness Act for the time being. \[House Vote 97, [4/11/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll097.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/11/13](http://www.cq.com/vote/2013/H/97); CRS Report #RL31867, [11/22/13](http://www.cq.com/pdf/crsreports-4387763); "The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means," House Rules Committee Minority Staff Memo, [3/18/10](http://www.speaker.gov/sites/speaker.house.gov/files/UploadedFiles/03-18-10_Previous_Question_is_NOT_Just_a_Procedural_Vote.pdf); Congressional Actions, [H. Res. 146](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-resolution/146/all-actions)\]

-   **House Rules Committee Republican Staff: A Vote To Order The Previous Question On A Rule Is "A Vote About What The House Should Be Debating" Which "Does Have Substantive Policy Implications."** According to a 2010 memo written by the then-House Rules Committee's minority staff, "This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow the opposition, at least for the moment, to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. \[...\] Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Democratic majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan." \["The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means," House Rules Committee Minority Staff Memo, [3/18/10](http://www.speaker.gov/sites/speaker.house.gov/files/UploadedFiles/03-18-10_Previous_Question_is_NOT_Just_a_Procedural_Vote.pdf)\]

-   **If The House Refused To Order The Previous Question, The Minority Would Assume Control Of The House Floor For An Hour And Could Offer A Germane Amendment To The Rule.** According to a 2010 memo written by the then-House Rules Committee's minority staff, "Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic majority they will say 'the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution ... \[and\] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.' But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the definition of the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress, (page 56). Here's how the Rules Committee described the rule using information from Congressional Quarterly's 'American Congressional Dictionary': 'If the previous question is defeated, control of debate shifts to the leading opposition member (usually the minority Floor Manager) who then manages an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the pending business.'" \["The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means," House Rules Committee Minority Staff Memo, [3/18/10](http://www.speaker.gov/sites/speaker.house.gov/files/UploadedFiles/03-18-10_Previous_Question_is_NOT_Just_a_Procedural_Vote.pdf)\]

-   **Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO) Said He Would Propose An Amendment To The Rule Permitting Consideration Of The Paycheck Fairness Act If Given The Opportunity To Do So.** According to the Congressional Record, Rep. Polis said, "If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to this rule that will allow the House to hold a vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act. Here we are in 2013\--2013\--and yet women make 77 cents for every dollar made by a man for equal work. Equal pay is not just a problem for women, but for all American families who work hard to pay their bills. It\'s high time that this body took up the Paycheck Fairness Act, which we will do if we defeat the previous question." \[Congressional Record, [4/11/13](http://beta.congress.gov/crec/2013/04/11/CREC-2013-04-11-pt1-PgH1923-2.pdf#page=3)\]

### Protecting Existing Equal Pay Laws

**2013: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Ensuring That The Proposed SKILLS Act Would Not Diminish Employment Protections, Training Opportunities Or Education Benefits Of Certain Seniors, Veterans, Women Or Young Americans.** In March 2013, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would \[have\] clarif\[ied\] that nothing in the bill would repeal, deny or loosen employment protections, training opportunities or educational benefits for certain seniors, veterans, women or youth." The vote was on a motion to recommit the underlying bill to the House Education and the Workforce Committee and report the bill back with an amendment. This was part of a larger package that would have also raised the minimum wage to \$10.10 in two years. The underlying bill was the House version of the SKILLS Act. The SKILLS Act reauthorized and overhauled 35 employment and job training programs into one funding stream for state and local use. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 184 to 233. \[House Vote 74, [3/15/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll074.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/15/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/floorvote-238228000); Congressional Quarterly, [3/15/13](http://cq.com/doc/floorvote-238229000); Congressional Actions, [HR 803](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/803/all-actions)\]

-   **Amendment Supporters Argued That The Underlying Bill Unfairly Targeted For Elimination Programs Established To Protect Young Workers, Working Seniors, Farm Workers, Workers With Disabilities, English-Language Learners, Veterans And Low-Income Workers, And Would Have Eliminated The Workforce Investment Act Of 1998 Directive Requiring The Poorest Workers Be Given Priority Of Service.** According to the Congressional Record, Rep. George Miller (D-CA) said, "First, the bill eliminates and consolidates programs simply for the sake of elimination and consolidation. The populations served by these programs often face daunting challenges in the job market. Youth, older workers, farm workers, workers with disabilities, English-language learners, veterans and low-income workers are among those who face the greatest barriers to employment. Yet, programs that serve these populations are the very programs targeted by the Republicans. Even worse, the bill eliminates the directive requiring these poorest workers to be given priority of service. With limited money, hard-to-serve populations will be left out in the cold. And we have yet to hear any credible evidence that eliminating these programs will save taxpayer money. We have yet to hear any credible evidence that these programs are duplicative, nor have we heard credible evidence that this approach will make the system work better." \[Congressional Record, [3/15/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-03-15/pdf/CREC-2013-03-15-pt1-PgH1435-4.pdf#page=2)\]

-   **The Obama Administration Opposed The Underlying Bill, Arguing It Would Downsize Employment Programs Protecting Those With Significant Barriers To Employment, Without Providing Critical Assistance To The People Those Programs Served.** According to a Statement of Administration Policy, issued by the Office of Management, "While H.R. 803 takes some positive steps, the bill does not adhere to the Administration's key principles for reform. The bill would eliminate, or allow the consolidation of, many targeted programs, without providing the critical assistance needed by vulnerable populations such as veterans, low-income adults, youth, adults with literacy and English language needs, people with disabilities, ex-offenders, and others with significant barriers to employment. H.R. 803 would freeze funding for the next seven years and would fail to support efforts to innovate and replicate effective approaches." \[Office of Management and Budget, [3/13/13](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/113/saphr803r_20130313.pdf)\]

-   **Supporters Said The Proposed Amendment Would Ensure That, Even With Cuts Made By Bill, "The Poor Will Get A Better Shot At Better Jobs."** According to the Congressional Record, Rep. George Miller (D-CA) said, "When I look at the bill before us, I think of Gregory and a million other hardworking Americans like him. The bill before us is not for him. He's low-income. Under this bill, he loses his priority of service even if he wanted to train to try to get new skills for a better job with better wages to provide for his family. With this bill, he wouldn't be able to. With this bill, we shouldn't ask what it does for people like Gregory but what it does to them. Under the Foxx bill, seniors and youth no longer have wage protections. Low-income workers no longer get priority of service. The voices of labor and community colleges are squeezed off the Workforce Investment Boards, and the poor and disadvantaged get the shaft. We propose this motion to do something different so that, no matter what happens with the adoption of the Foxx bill, the poor will get a better shot at better jobs, and those who are working in low-wage jobs will get a decent wage." \[Congressional Record, [3/15/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-03-15/pdf/CREC-2013-03-15-pt1-PgH1435-4.pdf#page=94)\]

-   **Opponents Said Proposed Amendment "May Hurt Workers And Job Creators And Increase Unemployment."** According to the Congressional Record, House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline (R-MN) said, "The best approach right now is to get Federal spending under control and government out of the way of the Nation's job creators. Republicans are always willing to discuss responsible proposals that will promote economic growth and help people get to work. Since the motion to recommit would force this committee to advance a proposal that may hurt workers and job creators and increase unemployment, I urge my colleagues to vote 'no' on the motion and 'yes' on the underlying bill." \[Congressional Record, [3/15/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-03-15/pdf/CREC-2013-03-15-pt1-PgH1435-4.pdf#page=94)\]

### Salary And Wage-Setting Negotiations

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Would Establish A Grant Program To Train Employers About Salary And Wage-Setting Negotiations.** In April 2021, Schweikert voted against en bloc amendments no.1 to the Paycheck Fairness Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "direct the Labor secretary to establish a program to award contracts and grants for the purpose of training employers about the role that salary negotiation and other wage-setting practices can have on bias in compensation." The vote was on adoption of amendments. The House adopted the amendments by a vote of 216-207. \[House Vote 106, [4/15/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll106.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/15/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/106?2); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 37](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/117th-congress/house-amendment/37/actions?r=2&s=a); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7/actions)\]

### Sexual Orientation And Gender Identity

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Including Sexual Orientation And Gender Identity Under The Definition Of "Sex" Regarding Federal Fair Labor Standards Law.** In April 2021, Schweikert voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "add a definition of 'sex' with respect to federal fair labor standards law, which would include sexual orientation or gender identity." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 217-210. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 108, [4/15/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll108.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/15/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/108?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7/actions)\]

-   **National Right To Life Warned That The Paycheck Fairness Act Could Be Construed To Mandate Employers To Cover Elective Abortions With Their Health Benefits.** According to the Scorecard Letter on H.R. 7 from National Right To Life, "While the legislation is meant to address potential discrimination regarding the gender pay gap, the legislation contains language that could be construed to require employers to cover elective abortion in their healthcare benefits." \[Scorecard Letter On H.R. 7 -- National Right To Life, [6/8/21](https://www.nrlc.org/federal/ahc/nrlc-scorecard-letter-on-h-r-7-paycheck-fairness-act/)\]

-   **Since H.R. 7 Changed The Definition Of "Sex" To Include "Pregnancy, Childbirth, Or A Related Medical Condition" Without Preventing Funding For Abortion, National Right To Life Claimed That H.R. 7 Could Be Used To Sue Employers That Refuse To Provide Elective Abortion Coverage.** According to the Scorecard Letter on H.R. 7 from National Right To Life, "H.R. 7 makes definitional changes to 'sex' to include 'pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition.' It is well established that abortion will be regarded as a 'related medical condition.' See 29 C.F.R. pt. 1604 App. (1986) and Doe v. CARS Protection Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 358 (3d Cir. 2008). Historically, when Congress has addressed discrimination based on sex, rules of construction have been added to prevent requiring funding of abortion. Since there is no rule of construction that would make this legislation abortion-neutral, it is likely that H.R. 7 could be used to sue employers for a lack of elective abortion coverage." \[Scorecard Letter On H.R. 7 -- National Right To Life, [6/8/21](https://www.nrlc.org/federal/ahc/nrlc-scorecard-letter-on-h-r-7-paycheck-fairness-act/)\]

-   **National Right To Life Warned That Under The Paycheck Protection Act, If An Employer Provides Male-Specific Health Coverage, A Person Could Claim Discrimination If The Employer Failed To Provide Abortion Coverage.** According to the Scorecard Letter on H.R. 7 from National Right To Life, "Under H.R. 7, if an employer provides health coverage for male-specific items, a person could make a claim that an employer's failure to provide health coverage for abortion is discriminatory." \[Scorecard Letter On H.R. 7 -- National Right To Life, [6/8/21](https://www.nrlc.org/federal/ahc/nrlc-scorecard-letter-on-h-r-7-paycheck-fairness-act/)\]

### U.S. Athletes In Global Competitions

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Require Equal And Non-Discriminatory Pay For Male And Female Athletes That Represent The U.S. In International Athletic Competitions.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Equal Pay for Team USA Act of 2022, which would "require the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee to ensure that female and male athletes who represent the United States in international amateur athletic events receive, from funds directly provided by the committee to the athlete, equivalent and nondiscriminatory compensation, wages, benefits, medical care, travel arrangements and expense payments. It would specify that the committee may consider merit, performance, seniority or quantity of play in determining contracts or other terms of participation, and may provide more beneficial terms to athletes to address disparities in outside income. It would require the committee to take 'all reasonable steps' to advocate to international sports federations to equalize athlete compensation and regularly report to Congress on the equal treatment of athletes, including information on the stipends and bonuses provided to athletes disaggregated by gender, race and status of participation on a professional sports team." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 350 -- 59, thus the bill was sent to President Biden and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 532, [12/21/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll532.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/21/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/532?17); Congressional Actions, [S. 2333](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2333/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Ensured Equal Compensation For U.S. Women's International Sports, Which Was A Long-Time Battle For The U.S. Women's Soccer Team.** According to the Associated Press, "The House has passed a bill that ensures equal compensation for U.S. women competing in international events, a piece of legislation that came out of the U.S. women's soccer team's long battle to be paid as much as the men." \[Associated Press, [12/22/22](https://apnews.com/article/biden-world-cup-sports-fifa-womens-addbf0a6ed17578a64ea056d3aa61b89)\]

-   **The Bill Required All Athletes Representing The U.S. In International Competitions To Receive Equal Compensation And Benefits, Regardless Of Gender, And Instructed The U.S. Olympic And Paralympic Committee To Oversee Fair Pay.** According to the Associated Press, "The Equal Pay for Team USA Act, passed late Wednesday, will require all athletes representing the United States in global competition to receive equal pay and benefits in their sport, regardless of gender. It covers America's 50-plus national sports and requires the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee to handle oversight." \[Associated Press, [12/22/22](https://apnews.com/article/biden-world-cup-sports-fifa-womens-addbf0a6ed17578a64ea056d3aa61b89)\]

### Workers' Rights

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Would Mandate Employers To Disclose Workers' Rights Through Both Physical And Online Publications.** In April 2021, Schweikert voted against en bloc amendments no.1 to the Paycheck Fairness Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require employers to inform employees of their rights under the bill\'s provisions through physical and electronic postings." The vote was on adoption of amendments. The House adopted the amendments by a vote of 216-207. \[House Vote 106, [4/15/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll106.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/15/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/106?2); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 37](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/117th-congress/house-amendment/37/actions?r=2&s=a); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7/actions)\]
