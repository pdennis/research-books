# Collective Bargaining

### Veterans Affairs Medical Employees

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Allowing VA Medical Employees To Engage In Collected Bargaining To Address Professional Conduct Or Competence, Peer Review And Compensation.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the VA Employee Fairness Act of 2021, which would "repeal limitations on collective bargaining agreements entered into by certain medical professionals employed by the Veterans Health Administration. It would specifically allow physicians, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, registered nurses, physician and dental assistants, and other medical staff appointed by the agency head to engage in collective bargaining to address matters of professional conduct or competence, peer review and the determination of employee compensation." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 219 -- 201. The Senate took no action on the legislation. \[House Vote 530, [12/15/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll530.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/15/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/530?10); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1948](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1948/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Would Have Expanded The Collective Bargaining Rights Of Medical Providers At The Veterans Affairs Department And Would Have Allowed Them To Negotiate Patient Care And Competency Issues.** According to Government Executive, "The House on Thursday voted 219-201 to pass legislation that would expand the collective bargaining rights of medical professionals at the Veterans Affairs Department, allowing them to negotiate over issues related to patient care and clinical competencies." \[Government Executive, [12/15/23](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2022/12/house-passes-bill-give-va-medical-employees-greater-union-rights/380958/)\]

-   **Doctors, Dentists, Nurses And Physician Assistants At The VA Are Hired Under Title 38, Which Bars Collective Bargaining Over Care And Competency Issues And The Trump Administration Expanded The Prohibition To Include Shift Scheduling.** According to Government Executive, "Physicians, dentists, registered nurses and physician assistants at the VA are hired under Title 38 of the U.S. Code, which prohibits collective bargaining over care and competency issues, as determined by the department's secretary. During the Trump administration, that exception to collective bargaining was vastly expanded---and labor leaders and Democrats say, exploited---to include issues such as shift scheduling. Then-VA Secretary Robert Wilkie used it to ban Title 38 union officials from accessing official time altogether." \[Government Executive, [12/15/23](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2022/12/house-passes-bill-give-va-medical-employees-greater-union-rights/380958/)\]

-   **The Bill Would Have Repealed The VA's Ban On Negotiating Over Patient Care And Competition For Title 38 Employees, Essentially Giving Them Full Collective Bargaining Rights And Providing Parity With Other Workers.** According to Government Executive, "The VA Employee Fairness Act (H.R. 1948), introduced by House Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Mark Takano, D-Calif., strips the department of its ban on negotiating over issues of patient care and competency for Title 38 employees, effectively giving them full Title 5 collective bargaining rights and providing parity both with other VA workers and medical professionals at other federal agencies." \[Government Executive, [12/15/23](https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2022/12/house-passes-bill-give-va-medical-employees-greater-union-rights/380958/)\]

The House adopted the rule by a vote of 216-206. \[House Vote 521, [12/14/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll521.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/14/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/521?38); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 1518](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/1518/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1948](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1948/all-actions)\]
