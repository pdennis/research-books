# Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

### Work Requirements

**2018: Schweikert Voted To Increase Work Requirements For Food Stamps Above The Proposed Requirements In The 2018 House GOP Farm Bill.** In May 2018, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "reduce\[d\] work-requirement exemptions from 15 percent to five percent of SNAP benefit recipients; would reduce the qualifying age of children from three-years-old to six-years-old with respect to work requirement-exempted parents; would set the same hour-per-week work requirement for married parents as for single parents; and would require employment and training program participants to have their work eligibility electronically verified through the E-verify system." The underlying legislation was the 2018 House GOP farm bill. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 83 to 330. \[House Vote 195, [5/17/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll195.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/17/18](http://cq.com/vote/2018/H/195?7); Congressional Actions, [H.
