# Social Security

### Disability

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Preventing The Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) Trust Fund From Becoming Insolvent As Part Of The Bipartisan Budget Act Of 2015.** In October 2015, Schweikert voted against preventing SSDI's trust fund from becoming insolvent. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The agreement includes provisions to prevent the Social Security disability insurance (SSDI) trust fund from becoming insolvent next year. It also authorizes new funding for Social Security Administration program integrity measures to combat fraud and creates a new penalty related to Social Security fraud, establishes new requirements for physician review of disability cases and creates new demonstration projects within the disability insurance program intended to make it easier for recipients to work. CBO estimates that the Social Security provisions in the agreement would reduce direct spending by \$4.4 billion over 10 years but reduce revenues by \$81 million over 10 years, for net savings of \$4.3 billion." The measure was part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which also "would suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2017 and increase\[d\] the discretionary spending cap for fiscal 2016 by \$50 billion and for fiscal 2017 by \$30 billion, with the increases split equally between defense and non-defense spending" among other provisions." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment with an amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 266 to 167. The Senate later passed the bill and the president later signed it into law. \[House Vote 579, [10/30/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll579.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/30/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/S/292?3); Congressional Quarterly, [10/27/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4780157?6); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1314](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1314/all-actions)\]

-   **AARP: Deal Averted A 20 Percent Benefit Cut For SSDI's Beneficiaries; Seven In Ten Are Age 50 Or Older.** According to AARP, "The Social Security Trustees' most recent report confirmed that in 2016, SSDI recipients will automatically lose 20% of their benefits because of insufficient payroll contributions to the SSDI trust fund. Also, 7 in 10 SSDI beneficiaries are age 50 or older." \[AARP, [10/27/15](http://www.democraticleader.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/AARP-Letter-on-Budget-Agreement-102715-FINAL-2.pdf)\]

-   **AARP Endorsed Budget Deal In Part Because It Averted Deep Cuts To SSDI.** According to the AAPR, "On behalf of our 38 million members and as the largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization representing the interests of Americans age 50 and older and their families, AARP strongly supports the bipartisan agreement you have reached to avert deep reductions in Social Security Disability Insurance benefits in 2016, and to address the imminent spike in Medicare Part B premiums which many older Americans would otherwise experience. Your efforts to reach across the aisle and together find sensible solutions to significant problems are appreciated and commended." \[AARP, [10/27/15](http://www.democraticleader.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/AARP-Letter-on-Budget-Agreement-102715-FINAL-2.pdf)\]

### Reduction Of Benefits

**2024: Schweikert Voted Against Repealing Provisions That Reduced Social Security Benefits For Individuals That Received Other Benefits.** In November 2024, Schweikert voted against , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would repeal provisions that reduce Social Security benefits for individuals who receive other benefits, including a government pension or a pension or disability benefit from an employer who did not withhold Social Security taxes. It would make the changes retroactive to benefits payable after December 2023." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 327 to 75. \[House Vote 456, [11/12/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll456.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/12/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/456?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 82](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/82/all-actions)\]
