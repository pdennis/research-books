### Requiring The GAO To Conduct A Study The Economic Impacts Of The Labor Negotiations At West Coast Ports

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Require The GAO To Conduct A Study The Economic Impacts Of The Labor Negotiations At West Coast Ports.** In November 2015, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study on the economic impact of the slowdown that occurred during labor contract negotiations at West Coast ports from May 2014 to Feb. 2015, as well as steps taken to resolve the dispute and what other mechanisms are available to the president to avoid disruptions in future labor negotiations at ports." The underlying bill was a surface transportation reauthorization. The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 200 to 228. \[House Vote 605, [11/4/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll605.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/4/15](http://cq.com/vote/2015/H/605?0); Congressional Actions, [H.
