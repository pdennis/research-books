# Poison Control Programs

### Authorizing

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Authorize Poison Control Activities Through FY 2019.** In January 2014, Schweikert voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, would have "authorize\[d\] \$30.1 million annually through fiscal 2019 for poison control activities, including a grant program for regional poison control centers, a national media campaign and the national poison control hotline." The House agreed to suspend the rules and pass the bill by a vote of 388 to 18. Afterwards, the Senate adopted the bill by unanimous consent, and the president signed it into law. \[House Vote 3, [1/8/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll003.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/8/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/H/3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3527](http://congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3527/all-actions)\]

-   **Poison Control Centers Provided Expert Poison Treatment Advice, Assistance And Training.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Poison control centers are medical facilities that provide immediate, free and expert treatment advice and assistance over the telephone in cases of exposure to poisonous or hazardous substances --- including household products, medicines, pesticides, plants, bites and stings, food poisoning and fumes. The centers also answer questions about potential poisons. According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, more than 72% of poison exposure cases are managed simply by phone, greatly reducing the need for costly emergency room and doctor visits. Besides managing a 24-hour hotline, which is continuously staffed by pharmacists, physicians, nurses and poison information specialists, the centers offer poison prevention training and education sessions to community institutions, along with educational materials." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/6/14](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4402295/3)\]

-   **Grant Program Funds Certified Poison Centers' Evaluation Of And Research Into Poison Prevention And Treatment Methods.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "This funding for the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) is used for grants to certified poison centers for evaluating best practices for poison prevention; developing patient management guidelines; improving national toxic-exposure surveillance; and expanding toxicologic expertise. It allows the PHS to utilize up to 6% of the grant program total for coordination, dissemination, technical assistance, program evaluation, data activities and other administrative functions, determined by PHS to be appropriate for carrying out the program." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/6/14](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4402295/3)\]
