# Food And Drug Administration

### Reauthorize The FDA For Five Years

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Reauthorize The FDA For Five Years And Providing It Nearly \$100 Billion In Discretionary Funding As Part Of A Larger Medical Funding Bill.** In July 2015, Schweikert voted for legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "reauthorize\[d\] \[the\] NIH for three years, through FY 2018, and it modifies agency research and loan repayment programs and creates other initiatives in an effort to promote medical research and the sharing of information from clinical trials. The three-year discretionary authorization for NIH totals nearly \$100 billion: \$32 billion for FY 2016, \$33 billion for FY 2017 and almost \$35 billion for FY 2018." The overall legislation would have, also according to Congressional Quarterly, "modif\[ied\] current federal processes involving medical research, developing drugs and other treatments, and testing and approving those drugs and treatments in an effort to accelerate the development and delivery of cures to diseases and medical conditions \[and\] reauthorize\[d\] \[the\] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) activities for five years and modifies elements of FDA's drug and medical device review and approval process to accelerate the approval and distribution of new drugs and medical devices for diseases and conditions that don't currently have treatments." The vote was on the legislation. The House approved the bill by a vote of 344 to 77. A separate, but related bill later became law. \[House Vote 433, [7/10/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll433.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/8/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4720400?14&search=6frKJFS9); Congressional Quarterly, [7/10/15](http://cq.com/vote/2015/H/433?13); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 34](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/34/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 6](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/6/all-actions)\]
