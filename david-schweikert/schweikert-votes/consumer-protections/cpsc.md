### Funding

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Appropriating \$166 Million To The Consumer Product Safety Commission.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2023, which would provide "\$166 million for the Consumer Product Safety Commission." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote 220-207, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate did not take substantive action on the legislation. Congress passed and signed into law the FY 2023 Budget through H.R. 2617. \[House Vote 383, [7/20/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll383.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/20/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/383?13); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8294](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8294/actions)\]

### Regulations Related To The Safety Of Children Toys

**2017: Schweikert Voted Against Exempting Regulations Related To The Safety Of Children Toys From Legislation That Would Add Requirements For How Federal Rules Are Made.** In January 2017, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "exempt\[ed\] rules related to the safety of children\'s toys or products. It would \[have\] remove the bill's provision that would effectively overturn two Supreme Court decisions that require federal courts to defer to an agency's interpretation of the underlying law or rule when considering challenges to agency rules." The underlying legislation, also according to Congressional Quarterly, "would modify the federal rule-making process, including by codifying requirements for agencies to consider costs and benefits of alternatives. The bill would create additional steps that agencies would need to follow when planning 'major' rules with annual costs of more than \$100 million or 'high-impact' rules with annual costs of more than \$1 billion." The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 190 to 233. \[House Vote 40, [1/11/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll040.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/11/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/40); Congressional Quarterly, [1/11/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/45?4); Congressional Actions, [H.
