### Regulation

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Regulate Ticket Sellers By Requiring Clear Disclosure Of Fees In Advertisements, Prohibiting Ticket Sellers From Claiming Affiliation With Venues Or Artists Without A Formal Agreement, Requiring Full Refunds Or Replacements For Canceled And Postponed Events, And Prohibiting Sellers From Selling Tickets They Do Not Possess.** In May 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would require all event ticket sellers to 'clearly and conspicuously' display the total ticket price, including all required fees, for an event in any advertisement, marketing or promotional materials. It would require sellers to include an itemized list of the base ticket price and each fee prior to the completion of the ticket purchasing process. It would prohibit ticket-selling entities from stating that they are affiliated with or endorsed by a venue, team or artist unless a formal partnership agreement has been executed. If an event is canceled or postponed, ticket sellers would be required to either provide a full refund for the ticket or a replacement ticket in most cases. Additionally, it would prohibit ticket distributors from selling tickets they don\'t actually possess. It would require that a violation of the bill's prohibitions be treated as a violation of Federal Trade Commission regulations defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice, and the FTC would be authorized to enforce the prohibitions, including through penalties. It also would require the FTC, within six months of the bill's enactment, to report to Congress on its enforcement of the 2016 online ticketing law which made it illegal to resell tickets purchased with computer bots." The House passed the bill by a vote of 388 to 24. \[House Vote 212, [5/15/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll212.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/15/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/212?11); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3950](http://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3950/all-actions)\]
