It would establish an affirmative defense for civil and administrative action brought to enforce the violation that an increase in price 'reasonably reflects' additional costs or risks taken to produce, distribute, obtain or sell fuel. It would specify aggravating and mitigating factors in determining violations including whether the price grossly exceeds the average price of fuel offered in the 30 days before the emergency proclamation or during a benchmark period established by the FTC; whether the price grossly exceeds the average price offered during the emergency period by other sellers in the same area; and whether the quantity of fuel produced, distributed or sold increased in an area during the emergency period, accounting for usual seasonal variation." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/19/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/232?19)\]
