# Short-Term Lodging

### Fees

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Require Short-Term Lodging Advertisements To Clearly Disclose Fees In The Reservation Price.** In June 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would prohibit a provider of short-term, overnight lodging from advertising a reservation price that does not include all mandatory fees, including parking, booking, cleaning and resort fees. It would require the Federal Trade Commission to enforce the prohibition as a violation of federal law regarding unfair or deceptive trade practices. It would allow a state to bring a civil action against a lodging provider in federal court to obtain appropriate relief on behalf of its residents if a federal civil action is not already pending, though it would allow the FTC to intervene in such actions. It also would prohibit a state or local government from enforcing any law prohibiting a lodging provider from advertising a price that includes all mandatory fees." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 384 to 25. \[House Vote 248, [6/11/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll248.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/11/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/248?11); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 6543](http://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6543/all-actions)\]
