### Disposable Wipes

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Require Manufacturers To Label Disposable Wipes With "Do Not Flush."** In June 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would require manufacturers and supplies of disposable wipes to mark their products with a 'do not flush' label and symbol. It would require individuals and entities that manufacture, wholesale, supply or retail premoistened, nonwoven disposable wipes to 'clearly and conspicuously' label their products with a 'do not flush' notice and symbol. The bill would require that packaging seams, folds or other design elements do not obscure the symbol or label notice. It also would require the symbol and label notice to be equal in size to at least 2 percent of the surface area of the principal display panel. Additionally, it would require the symbol and label notice to have high contrast with the packaging's background in order to be seen and read by an ordinary individual. The bill would prohibit a state or political subdivision from directly or indirectly establishing or continuing labeling requirements that are not identical to those in the bill. It also would direct the Federal Trade Commission to issue regulations to implement the bill within one year of its enactment." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 351 to 56. \[House Vote 249, [6/11/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll249.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/11/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/249?11); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2964](http://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2964/all-actions)\]
