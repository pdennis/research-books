# Class-Action Lawsuit

### Prohibiting Federal Courts From Certifying Class Action Status To A Lawsuit Unless Every Member Of The Class Has Suffered From The Same Injury, Including Its Degree

**2017: Schweikert Voted To Permit Federal Class-Action Lawsuits Only If Every Person In The Class Suffered The Same Type And Scope Of Injury.** In March 2017, Schweikert voted for the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "prohibit\[ed\] federal courts from certifying proposed classes of individuals for a class-action lawsuit unless each member of the class has suffered the same type and degree of injury. Additionally, the bill would \[have\] require\[d\] asbestos trusts to issue quarterly reports on claims made against the trusts and payouts made by the trusts for asbestos-related injuries." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 220 to 201. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 148, [3/9/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll148.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/9/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/148?24); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 985](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/985/all-actions)\]

-   **By Requiring Injury To Be The Same And Scope, It Class-Membership Could Be Sharply Restricted, Including In Sexual Harassment Cases By Requiring Women To Have Been Sexually Harassed By The Same Manager In The Same Way.** According to the Washington Post, "Doroshow and others said the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act would squelch most class-action lawsuits, which typically involve plaintiffs with a wide variety of similar complaints. It could sharply restrict membership in a class, for example, to women who had been sexually harassed in the same way by the same manager, they said." \[Washington Post, [3/9/17](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/house-gop-quietly-advances-key-elements-of-tort-reform/2017/03/09/d52213b2-0414-11e7-b1e9-a05d3c21f7cf_story.html?utm_term=.b0da2c48fd72)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Prohibit Federal Courts From Certifying Class Action Status To A Lawsuit Unless Every Member Of The Class Has Suffered From The Same Injury, Including Its Degree.** In January 2016, Schweikert voted for a bill that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] federal courts from certifying proposed classes of individuals for a class-action lawsuit unless each member of the class has suffered the same type and degree of injury." The legislation also, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] quarterly reports by asbestos trusts including claims made against the trusts and payouts made by the trusts for asbestos-related injuries." The vote was on passage of the bill. The House passed the bill by a vote of 211 to 188. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 33, [1/8/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll033.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/8/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/h/33?20); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1927](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1927/all-actions)\]

-   **Statement Of Administration Policy: Current Law Already To Determine A Lawsuit's Feasibility; The Bill's New Requirement "Would \[...\] Potentially Dissuading Plaintiffs From Pursuing Meritorious Claims, Including Under Important Civil Rights, Privacy And Consumer Protection Laws, And Denying Them Access To Justice."** According to a Statement of Administration Policy, "Class action lawsuits allow groups of individuals with similar injuries to vindicate their rights efficiently and effectively. Courts already have ample authority under the existing rules governing class actions to screen out frivolous and baseless lawsuits. H.R. 1927 would expand upon the existing rules by requiring the plaintiffs in a class action to demonstrate that each member of the proposed class suffered the same type and scope of injury. This new requirement would narrow the availability of class actions, potentially dissuading plaintiffs from pursuing meritorious claims, including under important civil rights, privacy and consumer protection laws, and denying them access to justice." \[Statement of Administration Policy, [1/6/16](http://www.cq.com/pdf/4814631.pdf)\]
