### Requiring Regular Reports From Asbestos Trusts

**2017: Schweikert Voted To Require Regular Reports From The Asbestos Trusts.** In March 2017, Schweikert voted for the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "prohibit\[ed\] federal courts from certifying proposed classes of individuals for a class-action lawsuit unless each member of the class has suffered the same type and degree of injury. Additionally, the bill would \[have\] require\[d\] asbestos trusts to issue quarterly reports on claims made against the trusts and payouts made by the trusts for asbestos-related injuries." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 220 to 201. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 148, [3/9/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll148.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/9/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/148?24); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 985](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/985/all-actions)\]

-   **Reports Would Require Public Disclosure Of Names, Medical Information And Awards To Victims; Veterans Disproportionately Suffer From Asbestos Related Illnesses.** According to the Washington Post, "That measure would also affect asbestos trusts, which distribute funds from legal settlements to victims of asbestos-related illnesses and injuries. The trusts would be required to publicly disclose the names, medical information and award amounts of victims, an attempt to cut down on fraudulent claims that opponents say would violate victims' privacy rights. Military veterans disproportionately suffer from asbestos-related illnesses and injuries, and many veterans groups are fighting the bill. 'Forcing our veterans to publicize their work histories, medical conditions, majority of their Social Security numbers, and information about their children and families is an offensive invasion of privacy to the men and women who have honorably served,' 18 veterans' groups wrote in a letter to congressional leaders." \[Washington Post, [3/9/17](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/house-gop-quietly-advances-key-elements-of-tort-reform/2017/03/09/d52213b2-0414-11e7-b1e9-a05d3c21f7cf_story.html?utm_term=.b0da2c48fd72)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Require Regular Reports From Asbestos Trusts.** In January 2016, Schweikert voted for a bill that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] quarterly reports by asbestos trusts including claims made against the trusts and payouts made by the trusts for asbestos-related injuries." The legislation also did, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] federal courts from certifying proposed classes of individuals for a class-action lawsuit unless each member of the class has suffered the same type and degree of injury." The vote was on passage of the bill. The House passed the bill by a vote of 211 to 188. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 33, [1/8/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll033.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/8/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/h/33?20); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1927](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1927/all-actions)\]

-   **Statement Of Administration Policy: Requiring Regulator Reports From The Asbestos Trust Fund Would Threaten Privacy, Including The Release Of Asbestos Victims' Names Due To "A False Assertion That There Is Endemic Fraud In The Asbestos Trust System."** According to a Statement of Administration Policy, "In addition, based on the false assertion that there is endemic fraud in the asbestos trust system, H.R. 1927 would impose mandatory reporting and disclosure requirements that would release into the public domain asbestos victims\' names, exposure histories, and other sensitive information. This disclosure would threaten their privacy, make them more vulnerable to identity thieves and other predators, and potentially disadvantage them in many ways unrelated to asbestos exposure, including in their efforts to obtain employment, credit, and insurance." \[Statement of Administration Policy, [1/6/16](http://www.cq.com/pdf/4814631.pdf)\]

### Specifying That A Bill Which Required Regular Reports From The Asbestos Trust Fund Would Not Apply To A Clamant Who Was Exposed To Asbestos As A Child In The School Environment

**2016: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Specifying That A Bill Which Required Regular Reports From The Asbestos Trust Fund Would Not Apply To A Clamant Who Was Exposed To Asbestos As A Child In The School Environment.** In January 2016, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "specif\[ied\] that the asbestos trust provision would not apply to a claimant exposed to asbestos as a child in a school environment." The underlying bill would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] quarterly reports by asbestos trusts including claims made against the trusts and payouts made by the trusts for asbestos-related injuries." The legislation also, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] federal courts from certifying proposed classes of individuals for a class-action lawsuit unless each member of the class has suffered the same type and degree of injury." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 158 to 211. \[House Vote 32, [1/8/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll032.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/8/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/32?26); Congressional Quarterly, [1/8/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/33?27); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1927](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1927/all-actions)\]
