# Youth Drug Use Grants

### Waiving Matching Requirements

**2021: Schweikert Voted For Allowing The Drug-Free Communities Support Program To Waive Fund Matching Requirements For Grant Recipients Who May Not Meet The Requirement Due To The Pandemic, And Increasing The Cap On Administrative Expenses To 12 Percent For The Office Of National Drug Control Policy.** In October 2021, Schweikert voted for the Drug-Free Communities Pandemic Relief Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "permit the administrator of the Drug-Free Communities Support Program, which provides grants for community coalitions to prevent and reduce substance use among youth, to waive fund matching requirements for grant recipients that cannot meet the requirement in a given year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It would also increase the cap on administrative expenses for the Office of National Drug Control Policy from 8 percent to 12 percent of total funding authorized for the office." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 395-30. \[House Vote 321, [10/20/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll321.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/20/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/321?14); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 654](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/654/actions)\]
