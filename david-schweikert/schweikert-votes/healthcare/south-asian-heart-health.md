# South Asian Heart Health

### Grant Funding

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Authorizing \$1 Million Annually Through FY 2027 For Health And Human Services Grants To Promote Awareness Of Heart Disease Prevalence In South Asian Communities In The U.S.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the South Asian Heart Health Awareness and Research Act of 2022, which would "authorize \$1 million annually through fiscal 2027 for Health and Human Services Department grants to states to promote awareness of the prevalence of heart disease in disproportionately affected communities, such as South Asian communities in the U.S., including to develop culturally appropriate educational materials and support heart health promotion activities and research." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote 237-192, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 398, [7/27/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll398.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/27/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/398?16); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3771](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3771/actions)\]

-   **The Bill Would Require HHS To Contract With The National Academies Of Sciences, Engineering And Medicine To Examine The Correlation Between COVID-19 Diagnoses And Morbidity And Mortality Rates Due To Heart Disease In At-Risk Communities.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "It would require the department to report annually to Congress on outreach efforts and data relating to heart disease in disproportionately affected communities and to enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine to study the relationship between COVID-19 and morbidity and mortality rates due to heart disease in at-risk populations." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/27/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/398?16)\]
