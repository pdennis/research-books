### Limiting Costs

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Capping Insulin Covered Under Medicare At \$35 Per Month.** In August 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against concurring in the Senate amendment to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which would "cap cost-sharing for insulin products covered under Medicare at \$35 a month." The vote was on a motion to concur. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote 220-207, thus the bill was sent to President Biden for final signage. President Biden signed the bill and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 420, [8/12/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll420.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [8/12/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/420?6); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5376](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/actions)\]

-   **Senate Republicans Only Challenged The Insulin Cap For Private Insurances, Not The \$35 Monthly Cap For Medicare.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans did not challenge the \$35 monthly cap for Medicare and that remains in the legislation as the Senate continues votes that began just before midnight on Saturday." \[Congressional Quarterly, [8/7/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7546800?5)\]

-   **According To The Kaiser Family Foundation, 53% Of Americans Believe Congress Should Prioritize Capping Insulin Costs.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Insulin caps are popular among voters. Roughly 37 million Americans have diabetes, and a recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 53 percent of Americans said that capping insulin costs should be Congress' No. 1 priority. As Democrats seek to hold their majority in the November midterm elections, the vote gives them a new talking point." \[Congressional Quarterly, [8/7/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7546800?5)\]

-   **Senate Republicans Were Successful In Removing The Provision That Capped Insulin Costs At \$35 Per Month For Commercial Health Plans.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Senate Republicans were able to strike a \$35 monthly cap for insulin costs in the private insurance market from the Democrats' health care, tax and climate package on Sunday morning, putting lawmakers on the record on a politically popular policy provision ahead of a contested midterm election. Seven Republicans joined Democrats: Bill Cassidy and John Kennedy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi and Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska. But the 57-43 vote to waive budget rules fell short of the 60-vote threshold needed, and the \$35 insulin cost cap for commercial health plans was removed from the measure (HR 5376)." \[Congressional Quarterly, [8/7/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7546800?5)\]

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against The Affordable Insulin Now Act, Which Required Private Insurances And Medicare To Cover Certain Insulin Products, Prohibit Deductibles For Insulin, And Cap Cost-Sharing For Such Insulin Products Beginning In 2023.** In March 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the Affordable Insulin Now Act, which would "require private health insurance and Medicare to cover certain insulin products and limit cost-sharing requirements for such products for plans beginning in 2023. Specifically, it would require private insurance plans to cover at least one of each dosage form of each type of insulin, such as short-acting, long-acting and premixed insulin; prohibit the plans from applying a deductible for the insulin products; and cap cost-sharing for the insulin products at the lesser of \$35 or 25 percent of the plan\'s negotiated price for the product per 30-day supply. For Medicare plans, it would similarly prohibit the application of a deductible for covered insulin products and cap copayments at \$35 per 30-day supply." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 232-193, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The bill was passed by the Senate and both chambers are resolving differences. The bill was turned into the Continuing Appropriations and Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2023 and that version ultimately became law. \[House Vote 102, [3/31/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll102.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/31/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/102?5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 6833](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/6833/actions)\]

-   **AHIP, A National Trade Association, Claimed The Bill Would Not Lower Insulin Costs But Instead Cost-Shift By Increasing Premiums And Copays.** According to NBC News, "The measure also faces industry opposition. AHIP, a national trade association whose members provide health care coverage and services, blasted the bill in a statement Thursday. 'While health insurance providers work to reduce insulin costs, this policy unfortunately does nothing to lower the price of insulin but simply shifts costs to others through higher insurance premiums and copays,' the organization said." \[NBC News, [3/31/22](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-bill-cap-pocket-insulin-costs-rcna22496)\]
