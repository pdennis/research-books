# Health Savings Accounts

### Doubling The Maximum Limit

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Double The Maximum Contribution Limit For Health Savings Account While Also Increasing The Amount Of Money That Slightly Wealthier Taxpayers Must Payback For Overpayment For Health Subsidies From The Affordable Care Act.** In July 2016, Schweikert voted for legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "modif\[ied\] rules related to health savings accounts (HSAs) by doubling the maximum contribution limit, allowing couples to divide their combined catch-up contributions among either of their HSAs, creating a special rule for certain medical expenses incurred before the establishment of an HSA, and repealing a rule under the 2010 health care law that made over-the-counter medications ineligible for coverage under HSAs." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 243 to 164. The Senate took no substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 351, [7/6/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll351.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/6/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/351?2); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1270](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1270/all-actions)\]

-   **Democrats Who Oppose The Bill Say That The Overall Bill Would Allow High Income Taxpayers Receive Tax Breaks While Forcing Poorer Americans To Pay Back Subsidies At An Increased Rate.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents of the bill, mostly Democrats, say it is part of a GOP agenda designed to shift people from affordable, comprehensive coverage to HSAs and high-deductible health plans. They say it would provide unprecedented opportunities for high-income individuals and families to further shelter income from taxes, while Congress is tightening budgets for programs that help vulnerable people." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/1/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4921117/21?11)\]
