### Extending Authority

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Extend The Authority For Medicare To Cover Telehealth Services Through The Later End Of 2024 Or The End Of The COVID-19 Public Health Emergency.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID--19 Act of 2021, which would "extend, through the later of the end of 2024 or the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency, temporary authorities for Medicare to cover telehealth services, including services provided by federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics; services received by beneficiaries at any site, including their homes; substance use disorder and mental health services without in-person visits; audio-only services; and services provided by occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech-language pathologists and audiologists. The telehealth authorities were initially authorized by the March 2020 coronavirus relief law (PL 116-136) and later extended through 151 days after the end of the public health emergency by the fiscal 2022 omnibus funding law (PL 117-103). As an offset, it would decrease funding available for the Medicare Improvement Fund from \$7.5 billion to \$5.153 billion." The vote was passage. The House passed the bill by a vote 416-12, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 400, [7/27/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll400.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/27/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/400?12); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4040](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4040/all-actions)\]

**2022: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against The Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID--19 Act Of 2021.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the "motion to recommit the bill to the House Energy and Commerce Committee." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote 205-221, thus the House voted on passage subsequently. \[House Vote 399, [7/27/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll399.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/27/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/399?11); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4040](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4040/all-actions)\]
