# Health Insurances

### COBRA Premiums And Co-Pays

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against The American Rescue Plan Act Of 2021, Which Granted Federal Subsidies Of Individual COBRA Premiums And Directed Veteran Affairs To Waive Co-Pays For Health Treatments Through September 2021.** In March 2021, Schweikert voted against concurring in the Senate amendment to the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for full federal subsidies of individual COBRA premiums and require the VA to waive health treatment copayments through September 2021." The vote was on concurring in the Senate amendment to the bill. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote of 220-211 and sent to the President and ultimately the bill became law. \[House Vote 72, [3/10/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll072.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/10/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/72?24); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1319](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/actions)\]

-   **The American Rescue Plan Provided A Temporary Full Subsidy For COBRA Premiums For Unemployment Individuals Who Wished To Keep Their Employer Coverage.** According to AP via CBS News, "Other people who lose their jobs may want to keep their employer coverage. A federal law known as COBRA allows that, but the employee has to pay the full premium, often a prohibitive expense. The bill would provide a temporary 100% subsidy." \[AP via CBS News, [3/9/21](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-relief-bill-health-care-cost-savings/)\]

-   **The American Rescue Plan Fully Covered COBRA Premiums Through September 30, 2021, And Individuals Who Found COBRA Too Costly During Their Initial Eligibility Were Able To Enroll During A New 60 Day Window.** According to Health Law, "ARP also pays for 100% of COBRA premiums for individuals through September 30, 2021. Individuals who found COBRA too expensive at the time of their initial eligibility would have a new 60 day window to enroll after being informed of the ARP COBRA provisions." \[Health Law, [3/12/21](https://healthlaw.org/the-american-rescue-plan-act-whats-it-do-for-health/)\]

### Coverage For Congenital Anomalies

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Requiring Health Insurances To Cover Diagnoses And Treatment Services Related To Congenital Anomalies Or Birth Defects, Including Dental Care.** In April 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act, which would "require health insurers to provide coverage for services related to the diagnosis and treatment of congenital anomalies or birth defects, including dental or orthodontic care. It would specify that coverage must include any medically necessary service that functionally improves, repairs or restores normal bodily function or appearance, and may not have coverage limits or cost-sharing requirements more restrictive than the predominant requirements under the plan. It would not require coverage of cosmetic surgery to improve appearance or self-esteem." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 310-110, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 109, [4/4/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll109.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/4/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/109?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1916](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1916/actions)\]

### Flexibilities For Employer-Sponsored Health Care

**2023: Schweikert Voted To Create Additional Flexibilities For Employers Providing Health Insurance Benefits To Workers, Such As Allowing Groups Of Employers And Self-Employed People To Establish Group Health Plans, Allowing Employer-Sponsored Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRA), And Preempting States From Restricting Stop-Loss Insurance.** In June 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Custom Health Option and Individual Care Expense Arrangement (CHOICE) Act, which would "create additional flexibilities for employers providing health insurance. The bill would allow groups of employers to establish and maintain group health plans for employees. It would require such groups to provide coverage to at least 51 employees and to have been in existence for at least two years prior to establishing the health plan. It would allow self-employed individuals to establish a group for the purpose of maintaining a group health plan. The bill would also allow employer-financed health reimbursement arrangements (HRA) to be used by employees to purchase insurance plans on state exchanges. It would also deem such HRAs compliant with requirements under current law for employers to provide health insurance coverage. To be eligible, it would require employers to offer the same HRA plan to all employees of a certain class, as defined by the bill, including full- and part-time employees, employees under the same collective bargaining agreement, and non-resident alien employees. It would also require employers to give eligible employees 90 days' written notice prior to the beginning of the plan year of their rights and obligations. Among other provisions, the bill would rescind \$245 million in fiscal 2024 from the Health and Human Services Department's Prevention and Public Health Fund, specify that stop-loss policies obtained by a self-insured group health plan or plan sponsor do not qualify as health insurance coverage under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and require the Treasury Department, within one year of enactment, to notify employers of the availability of tax-advantaged flexible health insurance benefits, with an initial focus on small businesses. HR 3799 also contains the text of the Small Business Flexibility Act (HR 3798), the Association Health Plans Act (HR 2868) and the Self-Insurance Protection Act (HR 2813)." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 220 to 209, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 282, [6/21/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll282.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/282?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3799](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3799/all-actions)\]

-   **Republicans Claimed The Bill Would Expand Health Care Choices For Workers, While Democrats Argued It Hindered The Affordable Care Act And Would Lead To Decreased Comprehensive Coverage.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House passed a package of bills Wednesday that Republicans contend would expand health care options for workers, but Democrats argue it would undermine the 2010 health care law and lead to less comprehensive coverage." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7775901?6)\]

-   **The Bill Mainly Focused On GOP-Supported Health Care Policies, Such As Association Health Plans And Health Reimbursement Arrangements, Which The GOP Claimed Would Help Small Businesses Provide Health Benefits To Workers.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The package (HR 3799), which includes the texts of three additional measures (HR 3798, HR 2868 and HR 2813), passed 220-209 on a party-line vote. It would mainly focus on health care policies Republicans have touted for years, like association health plans and health reimbursement arrangements, which they say would help small businesses offer coverage to their workers." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7775901?6)\]

-   **One Provision Would Codify A Trump-Era Regulation That Allowed Employers To Provide Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRA), Which Provide Workers Employer-Funded Accounts To Buy Insurance On The Individual Market Exchanges.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "One measure, sponsored by Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., would codify a Trump-era rule allowing employers to offer health reimbursement arrangements, which provide employees employer-funded accounts to purchase insurance on the individual market exchanges; Rep. Claudia Tenney's bill would notify small employers about the HRAs and available tax credits." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7775901?6)\]

-   **One Provision Would Permit Small Businesses And Self-Employed Individuals To Collaborate To Purchase Health Insurance And Form Association Health Plans.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Another bill, sponsored by Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., would allow small businesses and self-employed people to band together to buy health insurance and form association health plans." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7775901?6)\]

-   **Republicans Claimed Associated Health Plans Would Provide Small Business Workers A More Affordable Alternative And Claimed HRAs Would Permit Employers To Offer Health Coverage To Workers Without Managing Complex Health Plans.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans argue AHPs would give employees of small businesses a more affordable alternative to plans sold on the insurance exchanges, and HRAs would allow employers to provide health care coverage to workers without needing to manage complex health plans." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7775901?6)\]

-   **Democrats Argued That Association Health Plans Can Charge Higher Premium Rates Based On Gender And Age, Claiming Businesses Could Have Healthier Workers Create Association Health Plans Or Transfer Their Sicker Workers Into HRAs.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Democrats say association health plans are problematic because they can charge higher premiums based on gender and age. Both HSAs and HRAs could lead to higher premiums in the health insurance markets because businesses with healthier workers would leave to create association health plans or shift their sicker workers into HRAs, Democrats argue." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7775901?6)\]

-   **A Provision Would Preempt State Laws That Restrict Employers That Self-Fund Their Plans From Buying "Stop Loss" Insurance To Shield Against Unexpected Claims Losses.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "A third measure included in the package, sponsored by Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., would preempt state laws that prevent employers that self-fund their plans from purchasing 'stop loss' insurance to protect against unexpected claims losses." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7775901?6)\]

-   **Republicans Argued "Stop-Loss" Insurance Was Crucial To The Efficiency Of Self-Funded Plans And Guard Against Some Of The Financial Risks Associated With Providing Health Care Coverage To Workers.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Under a self-funded plan, employers typically assume all of the financial risk of providing health care coverage to its workers, but in some states can also buy stop-loss to guard against some of that risk. However, some states like New York have barred companies with less than 50 employees from buying stop-loss insurance, which Republicans say is crucial to making self-funded plans work." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7775901?6)\]

**2023: Schweikert Voted For An Amendment That Would Require The Labor Department To Notify Small Business Employers In Rural Communities Of The Availability Of Tax-Advantaged Health Insurance Benefits.** In June 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for an amendment to the Custom Health Option and Individual Care Expense Arrangement (CHOICE) Act, which would "require the Labor Department to focus on notifying small business employers in rural areas of the availability of tax-advantaged flexible health insurance benefits." The vote was on the adoption of an amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 281 to 151. \[House Vote 279, [6/21/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll279.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/279?35); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3799](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3799/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 208](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/208/actions?s=a&r=2)\]

The vote was on the adoption of an amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 211 to 220. \[House Vote 278, [6/21/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll278.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/278?34); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3799](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3799/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 207](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/207/actions?s=a&r=3)\]

The vote was on the adoption of the rule.

The vote was on a motion to order the previous question. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 215 to 207. \[House Vote 274, [6/21/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll274.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/274?14); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 524](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/524/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3799](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3799/all-actions)\]
