# Medicaid And CHIP

### Income Eligibility

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Excluding Classification As Income For Particular Pandemic-Related Unemployment Compensation For Medicaid And CHIP Eligibility.** In March 2021, Schweikert voted against a bill which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "exclude certain pandemic-related unemployment compensation from being classified as income for the purposes of Medicaid and Children\'s Health Insurance Program eligibility." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 246-175, sent to the Senate and President and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 96, [3/19/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll096.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/19/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/96?11); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1868](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1868/actions)\]

-   **H.R. 1868 Would Ensure Hospitals That Serve A Higher Number Of Uninsured Patients Are Not Punished For Receiving Additional Financial Aid.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill also would make several other changes to the aid law, including a correction aimed at ensuring that hospitals serving a disproportionate share of uninsured patients are not penalized for receiving additional aid." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/19/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6168713?1)\]
