### Benefits

**2014: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Prohibiting A Bill That Replaced The Medicare Physician Reimbursement Rate Formula With A New Payment System From Eliminating Guaranteed Benefits Or Reducing Benefits For Seniors And Individuals With Disabilities.** In March 2014, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the "motion to recommit the bill to the House Ways and Means Committee and report it back immediately with an amendment that would prohibit the bill from reducing Medicare benefits, eliminating guaranteed health insurance benefits under the program to seniors and individuals with disabilities, or from creating a Medicare voucher plan that would provide limited payments to Medicare beneficiaries in order to purchase private health plans." The motion was rejected by a vote of 191 to 226. \[House Vote 134, [3/14/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll134.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/14/14](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2014/H/134?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4015](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4015/all-actions)\]

**2013: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Excluding Legislation Protecting Medicare From Congressional Approval Requirements.** In August 2013, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the "motion to recommit the bill to the House Judiciary Committee and report it back immediately with an amendment that would exempt from the bill\'s congressional approval requirement rules that would \[...\] protect Medicare and Medicaid benefits." The House rejected the motion by a vote of 185 to 229; however, as of mid-December 2013, the Senate had taken no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 444, [8/2/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll444.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [8/2/13](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2013/H/444?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 367](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/367/all-actions)\]

-   **The Underlying Bill Required Congressional Approval Of Any "Major" Regulations, Including Those That Would Cost More Than \$50 Million, Would Hurt The Economy, Or Were Authorized By The Affordable Care Act.** According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill would have "require\[d\] Congress to approve executive agency regulatory proposals that are deemed to be 'major rules.' As amended, the bill would \[have\] include\[d\] in the definition of 'major rules' those likely to cost more than \$50 million; rules that would have adverse economic effects; any regulations crafted to implement or provide for the collection of a carbon tax; and rules made under the 2010 health care overhaul law." \[Congressional Quarterly, [8/2/13](http://cq.com/doc/floorvote-241402000)\]

### Covered Services

**2014: Schweikert Voted Against Instructing Medicare Administrators To Reconsider The Decision-Making Process For Coverage Of Ventricular Assist Devices.** In December 2014, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against a bill that would "instruct Medicare administrators to reconsider a decision on how the health program will cover a high-tech heart pump, known as a ventricular assist device, with an eye toward expanding the number of people awaiting transplant who may qualify. An instruction regarding the devices, known commonly as VADs, was included in the report accompanying the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education portion of the fiscal 2015 spending package (HR 83). With the language, appropriators are wading into a long running debate about who should get Medicare coverage for the devices, which are surgically connected to failing chambers, or ventricles. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in October 2013 updated the coverage policies for VADs, which Medicare began covering in 1996 as implants to help people with failing hearts survive long enough to get transplants. Appropriators have asked CMS to take a new look at whether to pay for devices for people who are undergoing an evaluation to determine candidacy for heart transplantation, and for those who might be future candidates if their health status 'may be favorably modified by the use of a ventricular assist device.'" The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate Amendment with an Amendment. The House agreed to the motion 219 to 206. The Senate agreed to by a vote of 56 to 40. Afterwards, the amended legislation was sent to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 563, [12/11/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll563.xml); Congressional Quarterly, 12/10/14; Congressional Actions, [H.R. 83](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/83/all-actions)\]
