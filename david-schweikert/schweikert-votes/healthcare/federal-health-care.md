# Federal Health Care Programs, Generally

### Effectiveness Measures

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Ban The Quality-Adjusted Life Years Measure Under Federal Health Care Programs.** In February 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would prohibit the use of quality-adjusted life years and similar measures when determining coverage and payment for treatments under federal health care programs, including Medicaid and the Children\'s Health Insurance Program. It would specify that federal agencies should not treat extending the life of an elderly, disabled or terminally ill person as being worth less than extending the life of a younger, non-disabled or not terminally-ill person. It also would prohibit Medicaid managed care organizations and Medicare Advantage plans from using quality adjusted life years measurements to make coverage decisions and policies. The bill's provisions would be effective on Jan. 1, 2025." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 211 to 208. \[House Vote 40, [2/7/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll040.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/7/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/40?22); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 485](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/485/all-actions)\]

-   **Democrats Opposed The Ban Stating That It Would Undermine Efforts To Lower Prescription Drug Prices And Discrimination Protections Are Already In Place.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "House Democrats and the White House opposed the legislation, arguing it could undermine efforts to bring down drug costs and that existing law prohibits the use of discriminatory measures. The bill's provisions would be effective on Jan. 1, 2025. 'Measures of effectiveness are essential to delivering higher quality and lower health care costs, and are an important part of our health care system,' the Office of Management and Budget said in its statement of administration policy." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/7/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7934551?19)\]
