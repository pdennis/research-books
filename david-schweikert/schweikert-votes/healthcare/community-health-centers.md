# Community Health Centers

### 2018 Extension

**2018: Schweikert Voted Against A February 2018 Two-Year Budget Deal Which, Among Other Things, Increased Spending By \$300 Billion, Suspended The Debt Ceiling, Reauthorized Community Health Centers For Two Years And Extended Numerous Tax Breaks.** In February 2018, Schweikert voted against a two-year budget deal that re-opened the government after a brief shutdown. According to the New York Times, "With Mr. Trump's signature, the government will reopen before many Americans were aware it had closed, with a deal that includes about \$300 billion in additional funds over two years for military and nonmilitary programs, almost \$90 billion in disaster relief in response to last year's hurricanes and wildfires, and a higher statutory debt ceiling." In addition, according to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation "would provide funding for federal government operations and services at current levels through March 23, 2018 \[...\] \[and\] retroactively extends numerous tax breaks that expired at the end of 2016. It also extends the CHIP program for another four years (through FY 2027) and funds community health centers for another two years." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the bill. The House agreed to the motion, essentially on passage, by a vote of 240 to 186. The bill was then sent to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 69, [2/9/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll069.xml); New York Times, [2/8/18](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/us/politics/congress-budget-deal-vote.html); Congressional Quarterly, [2/9/18](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2018/H/69?21); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1892](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1892/all-actions)\]
