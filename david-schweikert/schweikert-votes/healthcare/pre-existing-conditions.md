# Pre-Existing Conditions

### Protections, Generally

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against The Protecting Americans With Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019, Which Prevented The Trump Administration From Giving Waivers To States To Bypass Certain ACA Requirements.** In May 2019, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] the Health and Human Services and Treasury departments from taking any action to implement or enforce their October 2018 guidance regarding criteria for evaluating Section 1332 state health care plan waivers under the 2010 health care overhaul, and would prohibit the departments from effectively reissuing the guidance. Section 1332 waivers exempt state health care plans from certain federal requirements under the Affordable Care Act, including requirements related to qualified health plans, tax credits, and individual and employer mandates. To be eligible for such waivers, proposed state plans are required to provide care to a 'comparable number' of residents that is 'as comprehensive' and 'as affordable' as would otherwise be provided under the ACA. The October 2018 guidance modifies guidelines for considering waiver applications, emphasizing that a proposed state health care plan should be evaluated based on the number of residents that would have 'access' to comparable coverage under the plan, as opposed to the number of residents that purchase such coverage." In addition, also according to Congressional Quarterly, the bill "require\[d\] the Trump administration to rescind a 2018 guidance that made it easier for states to change their individual insurance markets and bypass the 2010 health care law. \[...\] In October, the administration released a guidance to give states more flexibility by exempting them from some of the waiver requirements. The administration later suggested ways states could change their insurance markets, including revising the rules for consumers to qualify for premium subsidies, allowing those subsidies to go toward plans that don't comply with all of the 2010 law's regulations or setting up high-risk pools or reinsurance programs to help cover the most expensive patients." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 230 to 183. \[House Vote 196, [5/9/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll196.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/9/19](http://cq.com/vote/2019/H/196?0); Congressional Quarterly, [5/9/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-5533337?9); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 986](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/986/all-actions)\]

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against Preventing HHS And Treasury From Doing Anything That Would Make Health Insurance Less Affordable For Those With Pre-Existing Conditions Or Be Less Comprehensive Than The ACA's Essential Health Benefits.** In May 2019, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] the Health and Human Services and Treasury departments from taking any action that would reduce the affordability, for individuals with preexisting conditions, of health insurance at least as comprehensive as the 'essential health benefits packages' defined under the 2010 health care law." The underlying legislation would have, also according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] the Trump administration to rescind a 2018 guidance that made it easier for states to change their individual insurance markets and bypass the 2010 health care law. \[...\] In October, the administration released a guidance to give states more flexibility by exempting them from some of the waiver requirements. The administration later suggested ways states could change their insurance markets, including revising the rules for consumers to qualify for premium subsidies, allowing those subsidies to go toward plans that don't comply with all of the 2010 law's regulations or setting up high-risk pools or reinsurance programs to help cover the most expensive patients." The vote was on the amendment. The House passed the amendment by a vote of 302 to 117. The House later passed the underlying bill. \[House Vote 193, [5/9/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll193.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/9/19](http://cq.com/vote/2019/H/193?0); Congressional Quarterly, [5/9/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-5533337?9); Congressional Actions, [H.
