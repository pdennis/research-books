### Children's Hospital Graduate Education Program

**2013: Schweikert Voted Against Reauthorizing The Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education Program Through FY 2017.** In February 2013, Schweikert voted against legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "reauthorize\[d\] the Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education Program though fiscal 2017 at the current funding level of \$330 million per year. The measure would \[have\] require\[d\] a report to Congress on program performance by the end of fiscal 2016." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion, passing the bill, by a vote of 352 to 50. The Senate took no substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 32, [2/4/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll032.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/4/13](http://cq.com/vote/2013/H/32?2); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 297](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/297/all-actions)\]

-   **The Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education Program Funds Hospitals That Have Graduate Level Residency Programs; Awards Are In Part Based On The Number Of Vulnerable And Underserved Children Served By The Hospital.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Children\'s Hospital Graduate Medical Education Payment Program provides financial support to hospitals that have graduate level residency programs. The program is meant to help defray the costs of resident stipends and salaries, salaries for faculty, overhead and other training-related costs. Hospitals are awarded funds through a competitive application process which calculates cost based on a number of factors and data. These factors include the number of residents, number of patients served and the number of vulnerable and underserved children. Roughly 48% of the medical students participating are general pediatric students. The program currently supports 56 freestanding children\'s hospitals and has provided more than \$2 billion in support since 2000." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/4/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4214063/2?12)\]
