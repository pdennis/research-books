### Regulations For Disease Reduction

**2017: Schweikert Voted Against Exempting Regulations That Will Result In Fewer Cancer Incidents Or Respiratory Death In Children Or The Elderly From Legislation That Would Add Requirements For How Federal Rules Are Made.** In January 2017, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "exempt\[ed\] rules that will result in reduced incidence of cancer, early death or respiratory disease among children or seniors. It would \[have\] remove\[d\] the bill's provision that would effectively overturn two Supreme Court decisions that require federal courts to defer to an agency's interpretation of the underlying law or rule when considering challenges to agency rules." The underlying legislation, also according to Congressional Quarterly, "would modify the federal rule-making process, including by codifying requirements for agencies to consider costs and benefits of alternatives. The bill would create additional steps that agencies would need to follow when planning 'major' rules with annual costs of more than \$100 million or 'high-impact' rules with annual costs of more than \$1 billion." The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 189 to 231. \[House Vote 37, [1/11/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll037.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/11/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/37?11); Congressional Quarterly, [1/11/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/45?4); Congressional Actions, [H.
