### Veterans

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Allow Veterans To Participate In State-Approved Medical Marijuana Programs.** In June 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "amendment no. 28 that would ensure veterans can participate in state-approved medical marijuana programs. It would remove the current directive that prevents Department of Veterans Affairs medical facility staff from recommending, making referrals, or completing forms and registering veterans for participation in state-approved marijuana programs." The vote was on the amendment. The underlying legislation was the FY 2025 Military Construction-VA Appropriations. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 290 to 116. \[House Vote 240, [6/4/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll240.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/4/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/240?11); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt.941](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/941/actions?s=a&r=28); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8580](http://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8580/all-actions)\]
