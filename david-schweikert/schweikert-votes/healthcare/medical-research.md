### New Medical Treatments

**2019: Schweikert Voted For Studying Diseases That Lack Treatments By The FDA.** In December 2019, Schweikert voted for an amendment to a bill lowering drug prices for Medicare that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require the Health and Human Services Department to conduct a study to identify diseases or conditions that lack treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration and instances in which development of such treatments could fill unmet medical needs for serious, life-threatening, or rare diseases and conditions. The amendment would also require the study to identify incentives that would lead to the development, approval, and marketing of such treatments." The vote was on adoption of an amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 380-45. \[House Vote 678, [12/12/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll678.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/12/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/678?39); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt.717](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/116th-congress/house-amendment/717/actions); Congressional Actions, H.R.3\]
