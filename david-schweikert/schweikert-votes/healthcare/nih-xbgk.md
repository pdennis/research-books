Of that total, \$400 million is the new NIH Innovation account within NCI for the Cancer Moonshot, as requested.

That agreement increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80 billion and the non-defense cap by \$63 billion. Given that the previous caps were set to reduce overall discretionary spending by \$5 billion, the net increase provided by the omnibus is \$138 billion over the FY 2017 level."
