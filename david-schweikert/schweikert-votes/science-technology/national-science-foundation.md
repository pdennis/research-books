### Digital Privacy Technologies

**2024: Schweikert Voted Against Awarding Grants For Research On Privacy-Enhancing Technologies.** In April 2024, Schweikert voted against , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would direct the National Science Foundation to award grants to support research on privacy-enhancing technologies, including algorithms and location tracking, to mitigate individual\'s privacy risks and improve the privacy of online activity. It would also permit the NSF to issue research awards to support education and workforce training and research on human behavior to help design better privacy solutions, as well as to create freely available privacy-enhancing technology libraries. It would emphasize research on privacy-enhancing technologies as part of NSF's overall computer science research mission. It would require any personal data collected in the course of NSF-funded research to be treated in accordance with federal privacy regulations. It would require the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to report to Congress within three years of the bill's enactment on its progress researching privacy-enhancing technologies and any policy recommendations to improve privacy." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 354 to 36. \[House Vote 154, [4/29/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll154.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/29/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/154?48); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4755](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4755/all-actions)\]

-   **The National Science Foundation Was Created In 1950 And Was Designed To Promote The Progress Of Science.** According to the National Science Foundation, "The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency created by Congress in 1950 'to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense...' With an annual budget of \$7.5 billion (FY 2016), we are the funding source for approximately 24 percent of all federally supported basic research conducted by America's colleges and universities. In many fields such as mathematics, computer science and the social sciences, NSF is the major source of federal backing." \[National Science Foundation, [Accessed 1/20/15](http://www.nsf.gov/about/)\]

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Reduce Funding For The National Science Foundation.** In April 2014, Schweikert voted for the Republican Study Committee's proposed budget resolution for fiscal years 2015 to 2024. According to the Republican Study Committee's budget, "Reduce Funding for the National Science Foundation (NSF). The NSF is charged with promoting science and engineering research projects through grant funding. Unfortunately, the NSF has a history of using taxpayer funds on wasteful projects, such as a laundry folding robot, a study of shrimp running on a treadmill, a study of Americans\' attitudes towards the U.S. Senate filibuster, and paying for participants\' expenses to attend an annual snowmobile competition in Michigan, among other examples. Beginning in FY2015, funding for the NSF should be reduced." The House considered the RSC budget as a substitute amendment to House Republicans' FY 2015 budget resolution; the amendment was rejected by a vote of 133 to 291. \[House Vote 175, [4/10/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll175.xml); Republican Study Committee, [4/7/14](http://rsc.woodall.house.gov/uploadedfiles/the_budget.pdf); Congressional Actions, [H.

### Reauthorization

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Reauthorizing And Expanding The National Sceince Foundation, Which Would Provide \$77.9 Billion Through FY2026, Direct Climate Change Research, Award Grants To Higher Education Institutions And Non-Profits, And Address Diversity In STEM Fields.** In June 2021, Schweikert voted against the National Science Foundation for the Future Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "authorize \$77.9 billion through fiscal 2026 for existing and new National Science Foundation activities and require a number of NSF actions related to research integrity and STEM workforce development. It would establish a new NSF Directorate for Science and Engineering Solutions to support research and development that addresses societal challenges such as climate change; global competitiveness in critical technologies; cybersecurity; national security; social and economic inequality; and education and workforce development in science, technology, engineering and math. Among other provisions, it would require the NSF to award grants to higher education institutions or nonprofit organizations to establish national and regional clearinghouses to coordinate STEM research; develop resources to connect new scientific discoveries to practical uses; align STEM education and workforce needs and conduct research on graduate education programs; and improve participation of historically underrepresented groups in STEM. It would require the NSF to maintain an office to coordinate research security and policy across the agency; facilitate public access to NSF-supported projects, including data, software and code; require any grant applicants to submit an ethics statement that specifies any foreseeable or quantifiable risks to society as a result of the proposed research; and appoint a chief diversity officer to establish diversity goals for the agency and advise on issues of diversity in STEM fields. It would authorize \$38 million for a pilot program to award grants to help research institutions secure federally funded research data." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 345-67. \[House Vote 186, [6/28/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll186.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/28/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/186?43); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2225](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225/actions)\]

### Requiring The National Science Foundation To Only Award Grants If It Is In The "National Interest"

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Require The National Science Foundation (NSF) To Only Award Grants If It Is In The "National Interest."** In February 2016, Schweikert voted for a bill that would modify how the NSF awards grants. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have, "require\[d\] the National Science Foundation (NSF) to award new grants for basic research and science education only if the foundation determines that the grant promotes the progress of science, is 'worthy' of federal funding, and is in the national interest. To be considered to be in the national interest, the grant would need to potentially enhance economic competitiveness, advance the health or welfare of Americans, develop a STEM workforce, or meet other characteristics specified in the bill. As amended, the bill would specify that computer science and information technology are sectors included in the STEM workforce. Also as amended, the bill would require additional determinations from the NSF that new grants are consistent with established and widely accepted scientific methods applicable to the field of study, and that they are consistent with the definition of basic research within the field of study." The vote was on passage. The House passed the legislation by a vote of 236 to 178. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 70, [2/10/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll070.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/10/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/70?30); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3293](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3293/all-actions)\]
