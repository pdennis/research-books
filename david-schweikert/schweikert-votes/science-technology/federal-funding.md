# Federal Funding, Generally

### FY 2016

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Fund Federal Science Programs For FY 2016 And FY 2017 With Funding Levels Below Administration Requests.** In May 2015, Schweikert voted for a two year reauthorization for various science programs below the president's request. According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill would have "authorize\[d\] \$32.9 billion over fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 for a number of agencies that support scientific research, industrial innovation and certain educational activities. Within that total, the bill would annually authorize for those two fiscal years: \$7.6 billion for the National Science Foundation, roughly \$7.9 billion for various Energy Department activities, \$939 million for the National institute of Standards and Technology and \$5 million for the Office of Science and Technology Policy." The vote was on the bill. The House passed the bill by a vote of 217 to 205. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 258, [5/20/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll258.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/20/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/258?16); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1806](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1806/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Included More Than A 33 Percent Cut For FY 2016 And 2017 For Energy Efficiency And Renewable-Energy Research And Development Programs.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill authorizes \$1.2 billion for each of fiscal years 2016 and 2017 for energy efficiency and renewable-energy research and development programs. That annual authorization is \$716 million (37%) less than the current appropriation." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/15/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4684616/19?23&search=1i5nN0Ko)\]

-   **Legislation Required That National Science Foundation Grants Be Provided Only If There Is Scientific Merit And If A National Interest Exists.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans say the measure would ensure accountability with regard to federal research spending, requiring that National Science Foundation grants be provided only if there is scientific merit and a national interest exists, while also reducing duplication in federal science and research programs." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/20/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4688484?19)\]

-   **Bill Eliminated The Requirement That Federally Funded Solar Research Programs Seek To Help Make Panels Low Cost.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill eliminates requirements under current law that the Energy Department consider improving U.S. energy security when developing renewable-energy research programs. It also eliminates requirements that federally funded solar research programs seek to help the manufacturability of low-cost, high-quality solar systems; that wind research programs include offshore wind energy (instead requiring 'transformational technologies' for harnessing wind energy); and that hydropower research seek fish-friendly large turbines." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/15/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4684616/19?23&search=1i5nN0Ko)\]

-   **Statement Of Administration Policy: The Administration Strongly Opposes The Legislation Because It Only Funds Clean Energy Research And Development And Grid Modernization At Less Than Half Of The Budget Proposed By The President.** According to a Statement of Administration Policy, "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1806, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015, which would undermine critical investments in science, technology, and research. The Administration believes that H.R. 1806 would be damaging to the Administration\'s actions to move American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth forward through a world-leading science, technology, and innovation enterprise. The Administration strongly opposes the bill\'s appropriation authorizations for the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) that would establish maximum funding levels significantly below those provided in the President\'s FY 2016 Budget. For example, H.R. 1806 would weaken investments in critical clean energy research and development and grid modernization by providing authorization levels at less than half of the funding levels proposed in the President\'s Budget for DOE\'s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability. \[...\] If the President were presented with H.R. 1806, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill." \[Statement of Administration Policy, [5/18/15](http://www.cq.com/pdf/4685634.pdf)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Would Increase Authorization Level Funding For Federal Science Programs Relative To The Underlying Bill.** In May 2015, Schweikert voted not to increase authorization level funding for federal science programs. According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have "authorize\[d\] five percent year-over-year increases for three major science agencies for fiscal years 2016 through 2020, including a total of \$42.5 billion for the National Science Foundation, a total of \$7.3 billion for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \$29.5 billion for the Energy Department Office of Science and a total of \$1.8 billion for Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy." The underlying bill was H.R. 1806, the America Competes Reauthorization Act, which "authorize\[d\] \$32.9 billion over fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 for a number of agencies that support scientific research, industrial innovation and certain educational activities." The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 179 to 239. The underlying measure later passed the full House, but the Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 257, [5/20/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll257.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/20/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/257?51); Congressional Quarterly, [5/20/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/258?16); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **The Underlying Legislation Funded Many Agencies That Support Science.** According to Congressional Quarterly, the underlying legislation would have "authorize\[d\] \$32.9 billion over fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 for a number of agencies that support scientific research, industrial innovation and certain educational activities. Within that total, the bill would annually authorize for those two fiscal years: \$7.6 billion for the National Science Foundation, roughly \$7.9 billion for various Energy Department activities, \$939 million for the National institute of Standards and Technology and \$5 million for the Office of Science and Technology Policy."
