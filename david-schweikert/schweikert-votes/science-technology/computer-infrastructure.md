### Expediting Federal Permits

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Expedite The Federal Permitting Process That Require Environmental Review For Infrastructure Construction For Semiconductors, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, High-Performing Computing, Advanced Computer Hardware, Quantum Information Science And Technology, Data Storage And Management, And Cybersecurity.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for a bill that would "make certain infrastructure projects that require an environmental review or authorization from a federal agency eligible for an expedited federal permitting process. It would specifically make eligible projects involving the construction of infrastructure for semiconductors, artificial intelligence, machine learning, high-performance computing, advanced computer hardware, quantum information science and technology, data storage and management, and cybersecurity." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 303-89, thus the bill was sent to President Biden and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 417, [7/29/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll417.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/29/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/417?11); Congressional Actions, [S. 3451](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3451/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Sought To Streamline The Others Types Of Manufacturing That The Semiconductor Incentives And Science Innovation Package Was Meant To Spur.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "But as Laura Weiss and Lindsey McPherson report, Hagerty said he was instead promised that the House in coming days would clear his Senate-passed bill (S 3451) that would also speed up permitting for other types of manufacturing the package is designed to spur. That bill is scheduled for House floor consideration today." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/28/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7536076?14)\]
