### Universal Service Fund

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating The Universal Service Fund.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted for a budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555, [10/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll555.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/5/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/555?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating The Universal Service Fund.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Repeal the Universal Service Fund (USF) The Universal Service Fund (USF) provides subsidized telephone and broadband services for lowincome \[sic\] individuals and in areas that are considered underserved. The USF is funded by 'contributions' from telecommunications companies---in reality, consumers pay a tax that is included on each monthly bill. Unfortunately, the programs run by the fund, including the LifeLine program, which provides free government-funded cell phones, are too often fraught with waste, fraud, and abuse. This budget repeals the USF, saving taxpayers \$115 billion in spending over the next ten years, according to the CBO." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed 10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]
