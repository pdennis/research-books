# Net Neutrality

### Block The FCC's Net Neutrality Order

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Blocking The FCC's Regulation Protecting Net Neutrality.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted for a budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555, [10/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll555.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/5/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/555?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Budget Called For Blocking The FCC's Regulation Protecting Net Neutrality.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Stop Net Neutrality A free and open Internet has been one of the greatest catalysts for innovation, opportunity, and economic growth. Rigid government regulation of the Internet will only stifle prosperity and progress. Congress should repeal the Federal Communication Commission's rule of February 26, 2015, reclassifying broadband Internet access as a telecommunication service under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This proposal is based on the Internet Freedom Act, introduced by Representative Marsha Blackburn." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed 10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted For An FY 2017 Financial Services Appropriations Bill Which Delayed The FCC From Implementing Its Net Neutrality Rule.** In July 2016, Schweikert voted to appropriate \$21.7 billion for financial services and general government for FY 2017. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "provide\[d\] \$21.7 billion in discretionary funding for financial services and general government appropriations in fiscal 2017."

### Restore Net Neutrality

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against Restoring The 2015 FCC Rules Establishing Net Neutrality And Overturning The 2017 FCC Order Overturning Net Neutrality.** In April 2019, Schweikert voted against a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "reverse the Federal Communications Commission\'s Dec. 2017 decision related to regulation of broadband internet services, which classified internet service as an \"information service\" to be regulated under Title I FCC authorities. It would effectively restore and codify a 2015 FCC regulatory framework and any other rules repealed or amended by the 2017 decision. The restored framework would classify internet service as a 'telecommunications service' to be regulated under certain Title II FCC authorities, and restored rules would include prohibitions on blocking and paid prioritization of content by internet service providers. The restored rules would be effective retroactively, and the bill would prohibit the FCC from effectively reissuing the nullified rules. It would also exempt small broadband internet providers from certain public disclosure requirements related to network management practices, performance, or commercial terms, for one year after enactment." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 232 to 190. \[House Vote 167, [4/10/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll167.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/10/19](http://cq.com/vote/2019/H/167?0); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1644](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1644/all-actions)\]
