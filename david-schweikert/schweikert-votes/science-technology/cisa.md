# Cybersecurity And Infrastructure Security Agency

### Cybersecurity Competition

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Authorize An Annual Cybersecurity Competition To Award Cash Prices To The Best Cybersecurity Practitioners And Teams Among Federal Civilian Workers Or Armed Services Members.** In May 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the President's Cup Cybersecurity Competition Act, which would "authorize the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to hold an annual cybersecurity competition to award cash prizes to the best cybersecurity practitioners and teams among federal civilian employees or members of the armed services, across offensive and defensive cybersecurity disciplines. It would authorize CISA to make one or more awards of up to \$10,000 each and the Homeland Security Department to make one or more awards of up to \$25,000 each. It would require the agency to annually report to Congress on lessons learned from each competition and how such lessons may be applied to improve DHS and CISA cybersecurity operations and recruitment." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 386-31, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 183, [5/16/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll183.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/16/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/183?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 6824](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/6824/actions)\]
