# Bipartisan Infrastructure Package

### Cybersecurity Resilience Programs

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Granting More Than \$1.7 Billion For Cybersecurity Resilience Programs.** In November 2021, Schweikert voted against concurring in the Senate amendment to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide more than \$1.7 billion for cybersecurity resilience programs." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote of 228-206, thus the bill was sent to the President and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 369, [11/5/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll369.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/5/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/369?3); Congressional Actions, [S.Amdt. 2137](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/117th-congress/senate-amendment/2137/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3684](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/actions)\]
