# Telecommunications Universal Service Fund

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Repeal The Universal Service Fund As Part Of The FY 2016 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted for repealing the Universal Service Fund. According to the Republican Study Committee, "This budget repeals the USF, saving the taxpayers \$96 billion in spending over the next ten years, according to CBO." The underlying budget resolution would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] for \$2.804 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2016, not including off-budget accounts. The substitute would call for reducing spending by \$7.1 trillion over 10 years compared to the Congressional Budget Office baseline." The vote was on the substitute amendment to a Budget Resolution. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 132 to 294. \[House Vote 138, [3/25/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll138.xml); Republican Study Committee, [FY 2016 Budget](http://rsc.flores.house.gov/files/Initiatives/rsc-budget.pdf); Congressional Quarterly, [3/25/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/138?23); Congress.gov, [H.

-   **The Universal Service Fund Provides Access To Telecommunications For Low Income And Rural Persons And Schools and Libraries.** According to the Federal Communications Commission, "The goals of Universal Service, as mandated by the 1996 Act, are to: Promote the availability of quality services at just, reasonable and affordable rates for all consumers Increase nationwide access to advanced telecommunications services Advance the availability of such services to all consumers, including those in low income, rural, insular, and high cost areas at rates that are reasonably comparable to those charged in urban areas Increase access to telecommunications and advanced services in schools, libraries and rural health care facilities Provide equitable and non-discriminatory contributions from all providers of telecommunications services to the fund supporting universal service programs" \[Federal Communications Commission, [Viewed 12/19/13](http://transition.fcc.gov/wcb/tapd/universal_service/)\]

-   **Funding For The USF Comes From A Fee Placed O Telecommunications Firms.** According to the Universal Service Administrative Company, "Telecommunications companies are required by law to make contributions to the universal service fund (USF), paying in a percentage of their end-user interstate and international revenues. This percentage is called the contribution factor, and it changes each quarter, varying with demand for universal service support." \[Universal Service Administrative Company, [Viewed 12/19/13](http://www.usac.org/about/about/universal-service/funding.aspx)\]
