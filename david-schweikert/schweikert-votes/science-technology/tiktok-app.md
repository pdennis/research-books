# TikTok App

### Ban Usage On Federal Devices

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2023 Omnibus Spending Package, Which Banned The Use Of The TikTok App On All Federal Government Devices.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against concurring with the Senate amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, which would "prohibit use of the Chinese-owned social media app TikTok on all federal government devices." The vote was on a motion to concur. The House concurred with the Senate amendment by a vote of 225-201, thus bill was sent to President Biden and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 549, [12/23/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll549.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/23/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/549?2); Congressional Actions, [S.Amdt. 6552](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/117th-congress/senate-amendment/6552/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2617](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617/all-actions)\]

-   **Bipartisan Lawyers Were Concerned That China's National Security Laws Could Coerce TikTok, A Chinese-Owned Platform, To Share The Personal Data Of Its American Users.** According to CNN, "The legislation bans TikTok, the Chinese-owned short-form video app, from federal government devices. Some lawmakers have raised bipartisan concerns that China's national security laws could force TikTok -- or its parent, ByteDance -- to hand over the personal data of its US users. Recently, a wave of states led by Republican governors have introduced state-level restrictions on the use of TikTok on government-owned devices." \[CNN, [12/29/22](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/politics/spending-bill-congress-omnibus/index.html)\]
