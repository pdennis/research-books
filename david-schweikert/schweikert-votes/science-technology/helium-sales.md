# Helium Reserve Sales

**2013: Schweikert Voted Against Extending Current Helium Supply And Storage Contracts Through October 1, 2015; Amendment Would Essentially Delay Underlying Bill's Reforms Until There Is Little Helium Left To Distribute.** In April 2013, Schweikert voted against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] existing helium supply and storage contracts to remain in effect until Oct. 1, 2015." The underlying bill, also according to Congressional Quarterly, would "establish a process for the government to continue selling helium from the Federal Helium Reserve after the program\'s debt is repaid. The bill would increase price transparency, require market-based pricing of crude helium through auctions and allow new refiners to have access to the reserve. Commercial auctions would continue until 3 billion cubic feet are in the reserve, with the remainder sold only to agencies for scientific and medical uses. As amended, it would require all profits to be used for federal deficit reduction after the program's debt has been repaid." The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 87 to 312. \[House Vote 126, [4/26/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll126.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/26/13](http://cq.com/vote/2013/H/126?0); Congressional Quarterly, [4/26/13](http://cq.com/vote/2013/H/128?1); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Rep. Rush Holt (D-NJ): "The Amendment Would Delay The Implementation Of The Reforms In The Bill Until 2018 At Which Time It Is Likely There Would Be Little Helium Left To Distribute To Anyone, To The Hospitals And The Doctors Who Need It, To The Electronics Manufacturers Who Need It, To The Scientists And Researchers Who Need It."** According to a floor speech, Rep. Holt (D-NJ), "The Federal Helium Reserve is in rapid decline. It is being exhausted. At the current drawdown rate, in 5 or 6 or 7 years the helium in the reserve will be largely depleted. The amendment by Mr. DENT seeks to run out the clock on this legislation to allow the existing regime to stand and prevent the reforms that H.R. 527 would bring forward. H.R. 527 does not alter or end the contracts that the refiners have with the Bureau of Land Management, but if we do nothing and allow the gentleman's amendment to go forward, under existing law and terms of those contracts, the entire helium program would come to an end in October of 2013---this year. The amendment would delay the implementation of the reforms in the bill until 2018 at which time it is likely there would be little helium left to distribute to anyone, to the hospitals and the doctors who need it, to the electronics manufacturers who need it, to the scientists and researchers who need it. This amendment would gut the bipartisan reforms of the bill, and it should be defeated." \[Congressional Record, [4/26/13](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2013/04/26/CREC-2013-04-26-pt1-PgH2357-4.pdf)\]
