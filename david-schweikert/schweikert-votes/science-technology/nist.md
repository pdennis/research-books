### Funding

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Authorizing \$9.7 Billion Through FY 2027 For The National Institute Of Standards And Technology, Including For The Expansion Of Programs And Activities In Cybersecurity And Information Security.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against concurring with the Senate amendment to the Chips and Science Act, which would "authorize \$9.7 billion through fiscal 2027 for the National Institute of Standards and Technology and expand NIST programs and activities in information security, cybersecurity and key technology focus areas." The vote was on a motion to concur. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote of 243-187, thus the bill was sent to the President. \[House Vote 404, [7/28/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll404.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/28/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/404?12); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4346](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4346/actions)\]

-   **The Funding For The National Institute Of Standards And Technology Would Go Towards Supporting Smaller Manufactures, Improving The Supply Chain And Establishing Education And Workforce Development Programs.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The \$9 billion authorization for NIST, which would represent a \$4 billion increase over baseline funding, is focused on boosting smaller manufacturers, shoring up the domestic supply chain and building education and workforce development programs." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/27/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7535056?3)\]
