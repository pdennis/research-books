Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, which would, in part, "move all prosecutorial and judicial duties for major military crimes outside the chain of command and classify sexual harassment as a major crime."

-   **By Shifting Prosecution Powers For Certain Military Crimes To Trained Prosecutors And Expanding The Covered Crimes To 14 Crimes, Including Sexual Harassment, The FY 2023 Spending Bill Provided A Milestone Change In The Military Justice System.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill is also a milestone in the campaign to change prosecutions in the military justice system. The fiscal 2022 NDAA (PL117-81) had shifted key prosecution powers for certain crimes from military commanders to trained prosecutors. This year's NDAA would further grow those powers and expand the covered crimes from 11 to 14, including sexual harassment." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/15/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7623137?3)\]

The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 363-70. The bill was sent to President Biden and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 405, [12/7/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll405.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/7/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/405?4); Congressional Actions, [S. 1605](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1605/actions)\]

-   **The Bill Would Instruct The Pentagon To No Longer "Prosecute Crimes Of Sexual Assault And Related Crimes From The Military Chain Of Command," But Not All Felonies Would Be Removed From The Chain Of Command.** According to CBS News, "One of the highest-profile issues this year in Congress was figuring out how to address sexual assault in the military. The bill would remove the decision to prosecute crimes of sexual assault and related crimes from the military chain of command, but it would not remove all felonies from the chain of command, as Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York advocated." \[CBS News, [12/8/21](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/defense-bill-2021-house-vote/)\]

-   **According To Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, The Provisions To Address Sexual Assault Would Not Be Substantive Enough Because It Would Not Reform The Military Justice System By Not Removing Serious Crimes Out Of The Chain Of Command.** According to CBS News, "But Gillibrand said Wednesday that the NDAA does not go far enough with the military justice provisions. She added that the initiatives, which have bipartisan support, were stripped from the final bill. 'This bill does not reform the military justice system in a way that will truly help survivors get justice,' Gillibrand said. 'It does not remove serious crimes out of the chain of command, which is the only way to create the professional unbiased system that we've been advocating for.'" \[CBS News, [12/8/21](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/defense-bill-2021-house-vote/)\]

-   **The Bill Would Instruct The Defense Department To Keep An Eye On "Allegations Of Retaliation" Against Sexual Assault Or Harassment Victims And Third-Party Individuals.** According to CBS News, "The NDAA also would require the Defense Department to track allegations of retaliation against victims of sexual assault or harassment and third-party individuals who have reported an incident." \[CBS News, [12/8/21](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/defense-bill-2021-house-vote/)\]

-   **According To Representative Anthony Brown Of Maryland, The Bill Did Not Address Racial Bias In The Justice System Within The Military.** According to CNN, "Democratic Rep. Anthony Brown of Maryland outlined why he would be voting against the legislation. He said he believes the bill doesn't go far enough to address racial bias in the military justice system. 'At a time when Democrats control the House, the Senate, and the Executive Branch, it is an unconscionable failure to deliver a National Defense Authorization Act that does not meet the values of equity and justice for which we have long strived or a bill that does not meaningfully protect the foundations of our democracy,' Brown said in a statement." \[CNN, [12/8/21](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/07/politics/house-votes-ndaa-national-defense-authorization-act/index.html)\]

-   **The Bill Would Instruct The Removal Of The Commander Of A Military Command From Prosecution Decisions Of Covered Crimes, And, Instead, An Office Of The Special Trial Counsel For Each Services Would Handle Prosecution Of Covered Crimes, Including Sexual Assault.** According to CNN, "The final version of the bill removes the commander of a military command 'from decisions related to the prosecution of covered crimes,' including 'sexual assault,' an important shift that military leaders including Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley have publicly said they support. Instead, the bill establishes, each service will now have an Office of the Special Trial Counsel to handle prosecution of those crimes, including sexual assault, that will report to each service secretary." \[CNN, [12/8/21](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/07/politics/house-votes-ndaa-national-defense-authorization-act/index.html)\]

-   **For The First Time, Sexual Harassment Would Be Considered A Crime Under The Uniform Code Of Military Justice And Claims Would Need To Be Investigated Outside The Chain Of Command.** According to CNN, "The bill makes sexual harassment a crime in the Uniform Code of Military Justice for the first time. 'All claims of sexual harassment will be required to be investigated by an independent investigator outside of the chain of command,' the bill summary states." \[CNN, [12/8/21](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/07/politics/house-votes-ndaa-national-defense-authorization-act/index.html)\]

-   **Under The Instructions To "Track Allegations Of Retaliation" By Sexual Assault And Harassment Victims, Each Service Would Need To Collect Demographic Information On The Accused Individuals And Victims.** According to CNN, "It also directs the department to 'track allegations of retaliation by victims' of sexual assault and harassment. Each service will be required to track the demographic information of both the person accused of committing sexual assault and harassment crimes and the victim of those crimes." \[CNN, [12/8/21](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/07/politics/house-votes-ndaa-national-defense-authorization-act/index.html)\]

-   **The Bill Would Empower Special Prosecutors, Instead Of Military Commanders, To Decide Whether To Prosecute Sexual Assault And Harassment, Murder, Kidnapping And Other Serious Crimes.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The NDAA that the House passed in September would have empowered special prosecutors in the services to make decisions now reserved for military commanders on whether to prosecute sexual and related offenses. The final measure does that while covering more crimes, such as murder and kidnapping, in addition to sexual crimes, and it would make sexual harassment a crime in the military." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/7/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6409157?10)\]

-   **The Special Prosecutors Would Decide Whether To Prosecute And Go To Trial, Whereas Commanders Would Have The Ability To "Convene Courts-Martial."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Moreover, the special prosecutors would be more independent of the chain of command than in the original House bill. Under the final measure, commanders would have the power to convene courts-martial, but the new prosecutors' offices would be the ones to decide whether or not to bring charges and whether to actually go to trial." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/7/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6409157?10)\]

-   **The Bill Would Reform The Prosecution Of Certain Crimes In The Military, Including Sexual Assault.** According to The Hill, "The defense bill also includes a major overhaul of how the military prosecutes certain crimes, including military sexual assault." \[The Hill, [12/15/21](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/585920-senate-approves-sweeping-defense-bill)\]

-   **The Bill Would Strip Military Commanders Of Most Of Their Authority, But They Would Retain Authority To Orchestrate Trials, Select Jury Members, Accept Witnesses And Provide Immunity.** According to The Hill, "The bill strips commanders of most of their authority, but they would still be allowed to conduct trials, pick jury members, approve witnesses and grant immunity." \[The Hill, [12/15/21](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/585920-senate-approves-sweeping-defense-bill)\]

-   **Senator Kirsten Gillibrand Proposed To Remove Military Commanders From The Chain Of Command Entirely And Permit Independent Prosecutors Handle Cases, But Was Not Included In The Bill.** According to The Hill, "The changes were not enough for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who had been pressing to completely remove commanders from the chain of command in these instances and let independent military prosecutors handle them." \[The Hill, [12/15/21](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/585920-senate-approves-sweeping-defense-bill)\]
