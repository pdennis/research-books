# Defense Spending

### Energy Resiliency In European Command Zone

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Directing The Defense Department To Enhance Energy Resiliency Of Operating Bases In The European Command Zone And End The Use Of Russian Energy Within Five Years.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, which would, in part, "require the DOD to make plans to increase the energy resiliency of operating bases in the European Command zone and eliminate the use of Russian energy within five years." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 350-80, thus the bill was sent to the Senate for final concurrence. The Senate concurred with the House, sent the final bill to President Biden, and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 516, [12/8/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll516.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/8/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/516?24); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 1512](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/1512/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7776](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7776/all-actions)\]

### FY 2013

**2013: Schweikert Voted For FY 2013 Defense Appropriations Bill That Provided \$605 Billion For Discretionary Defense Spending, Minus \$43 Billion In Estimated Automatic Budget Cuts.** In March 2013, Schweikert voted for the House's version of the FY 2013 Defense Appropriations Bill, which was bundled with a military construction and veterans appropriations bill for FY2013, and a continuing resolution funding the rest of the government through the end of FY 2013 at FY 2012 levels. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure provide\[d\] \$605.3 billion in pre-sequestration funding for defense, including \$518.1 billion in base funding for the Defense Department --- \$2 billion more than the president\'s FY 2013 request, and roughly equal to the FY 2012 level. \[...\] OMB estimate\[d\] sequestration would cut most defense accounts by 7.8% or approximately \$43 billion in FY 2013. Spending on military personnel, however, is generally exempt from the sequestration, as is most war funding." The House passed the bill by a vote of 267 to 151. Following House passage, the Senate passed a substitute version of the bill, which the House then approved and the president signed into law. \[House Vote 62, [3/6/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll062.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/6/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4231829); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 933](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/933/all-actions)\]

-   **Bill Included 1.7 Percent Military Pay Increase, \$70 Billion For Defense Research And Development And \$127.5 Billion For Military Personnel.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure\'s base defense funding includes \$173.5 billion for operations and maintenance, \$127.5 billion for military personnel, \$100.4 billion for procurement, \$70 billion for research and development, and \$32.7 billion for Defense health programs --- the fastest-growing part of the department. \[...\] It also provides for a 1.7% increase in military pay." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/6/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4231829)\]

-   **Bill Included \$10 Billion For Ballistic Missile Defense Programs, Including Programs Congress Had Just Eliminated.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill appropriates roughly \$10 billion for missile defense programs. It provides additional funds for cooperative missile defense programs with Israel, and funding for the MEADS cooperative missile defense system being developed with Germany and Italy that was terminated in the recently enacted Defense Authorization Act." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/6/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4231829)\]

-   **Bill Included Nearly \$6 Billion For J-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The total includes \[...\] almost \$6 billion for continued procurement of the F-35 Joint Striker Fighter \[sic\] plane." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/6/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4231829)\]

### FY 2014

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Provide \$512.5 Billion To The Defense Department For Fiscal Year 2014, And Another \$82.3 Billion For Operations In Afghanistan And The General War On Terror.** In July 2013, Schweikert voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, would have "provide\[d\] \$512.5 billion in non-war discretionary funding for the Defense Department in fiscal 2014. It also would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$82.3 billion in fiscal 2014 for contingency funds to support operations in Afghanistan and the general war on terrorism. The bill would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$241.1 billion for operations and maintenance, \$105.5 billion for procurement, \$66.5 billion for research and development and \$139.3 billion for military personnel, including a 1.8 percent pay raise. It also would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$34.5 billion for the Defense Health Program. As amended, it would \[have\] bar\[red\] the use of funds in the bill by the National Security Administration to target U.S. individuals or acquire and store the content of their communications, including phone calls and e-mails." The House approved the bill by a vote of 315 to 109, but the Senate took no action on the bill. \[House Vote 414, [7/24/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll414.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/24/13](http://cq.com/doc/floorvote-241109000); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2397](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2397/all-actions)\]

-   **Bill Sought To Prevent Sequestration-Caused Defense Department Furloughs Of Civilian Employees In Fiscal Year 2014.** According to the Columbus Dispatch, "The House passed a nearly \$600 billion defense-spending bill yesterday that included several measures aimed at keeping the Defense Department from furloughing civilian employees during the next fiscal year. The House defense appropriations bill includes at least three amendments aimed at barring the federal government from using any money to implement Defense Department furloughs. An amendment introduced by Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., would bar the use of federal dollars to implement sequestration-related furloughs of civilian defense employees. The two other amendments are aimed at preventing furloughs of those whose salaries are paid by a revolving fund not directly funded through congressional appropriations, and of those who are federal employees and also members of the National Guard or reserves." \[Columbus Dispatch, 7/25/13\]

-   **Supporters Said Bill Restored Needed Funding To Defense Department That The Sequester Had Unwisely Cut.** According to a press release, Rep. Ralph Hall (R-TX) said, "'Ensuring the safety of all Americans is our greatest responsibility, and safety is provided through a strong national defense and by the brave efforts of our servicemen and women,' said Hall. 'In order for our troops to do their duties effectively and efficiently, they must have adequate funding.' Hall continued, 'When the President\'s sequester - which I opposed - took effect in March, half of the imposed cuts were irresponsibly made to Defense. In fact, the Department of Defense now faces a nearly 20% reduction in funding over the next 10 years. According to then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, these reductions go well beyond reducing inefficiencies and cut directly into necessary troop force structure and military modernization. Sequester-level Defense funding puts national security and the safety of our troops at great risk and endangers both federal and private sector jobs. That is why I am pleased to support this appropriations bill to close the gap on the drastic sequester cuts, stabilize America\'s Defense, and protect the security of Americans.'" \[Press Release -- Rep. Ralph Hall, 7/25/13\]

-   **Opponents Said "Bloated" Bill Spent Money On Weapons Programs The Pentagon Did Not Want And On Obsolete Programs.** According to a press release from the Congressional Progressive Caucus, "Republicans passed a bloated defense budget today that spends money on weapons programs the Pentagon doesn\'t want. This comes a week after they voted to cut funding to feed America\'s neediest children. The United States needs a leaner but more capable military able to defeat 21st-century threats. We also need to invest in jobs, education and affordable healthcare for working families. Republicans wrongly decided today that we can\'t have both. The Republican bill spends \$47 billion more than the sequester-prescribed cap on defense spending allows and includes an additional \$85 billion for overseas contingency operations, primarily to fund the war in Afghanistan. The bill increases spending on outdated programs and does little to help the 650,000 civilian Defense Department employees already being furloughed. This bill is a missed opportunity to invest in what we need and cut what we don\'t." \[Press Release -- Congressional Progressive Caucus, 7/25/13\]

**2013: Schweikert Voted Against Authorizing \$638.4 Billion For Defense Programs In Fiscal Year 2014.** In June 2013, Schweikert voted against a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, would have "authorize\[d\] \$638.4 billion for defense programs in fiscal 2014, including \$85.8 billion for overseas contingency operations. Excluding the war funding, it would \[have\] authorize\[d\] \$241.7 billion for operations and maintenance; \$99.6 billion for procurement; \$136.1 billion for military personnel; \$10.1 billion for military construction, family housing and base closure; \$68 billion for research, development, testing and evaluation; nearly \$10 billion for missile defense and \$33.7 billion for the Defense Health Program. The bill would \[have\] authorize\[d\] a 1.8 percent pay increase for military personnel and would \[have\] prohibit\[ed\] the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay military facilities to the United States. The bill would \[have\] establish\[ed\] mandatory minimum sentences for sexual assault offenses and bar commanders from dismissing a finding in such cases by a court martial or reducing a guilty finding to a lesser offense. As amended it would \[have\] state\[d\] that it is U.S. policy that the president shall transfer combat operations from U.S. forces to Afghanistan by the end of 2013 and complete an accelerated transition of military and security operations by the end of 2014." The House approved the bill by a vote of 315 to 108, but the Senate took no action on the bill. \[House Vote 244, [6/14/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll244.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/14/13](http://cq.com/doc/floorvote-240084000); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1960](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1960/all-actions)\]

-   **Bill Prohibited Commanders From Overturning Rape And Sexual Assault Convictions, And Increased Required Penalties For Rape And Sexual Assault-Related Crimes In The Military.** According to CBS News, "In addition to those routine authorizations, however, the bill also cracks down on sexual assault in the military, an issue that has been under the microscope since a recent report revealed that there were 26,000 cases of military sexual assault in 2012. The bill includes a mandatory two-year jail sentence for armed service members convicted in a military court of rape or sexual assault and would strip commanders of the power to overturn convictions in rape and sexual assault cases. Moreover, it calls for the dismissal or dishonorable discharge of service members convicted of attempting or committing sex-related crimes such as rape, sexual assault, or forced sodomy. It also would allow victims of sexual assault to apply for a permanent transfer out of their unit and allow commanders to temporarily transfer those who have been accused of sexual assault." \[CBS News, 6/14/13\]

-   **Bill Required Defense Secretary To Outline Military Options For Removing Syrian Leader Bashar Assad From Power.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill would require Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to outline military options for removing Assad from power, including the establishment of a no-fly zone, arming the Free Syrian Army with heavy military equipment and conducting limited airstrikes against runways and other infrastructure. \[House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard "Buck"\] McKeon said he was 'deeply concerned about our ability to honor and uphold red lines' \-- referring to a point at which the United States would have to respond militarily in Syria \-- given the impact of budget cuts on military readiness." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/14/13](http://cq.com/doc/news-4295834?wr=eFF6UlQqRXM3azNGblp4eFZ2eXN0QQ)\]

-   **Bill Required U.S. To Transfer Afghanistan Combat Operations To Afghan Forces By End Of 2013, Vote On Deployment Of U.S. Troops Past 2014.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "\[T\]he House on Thursday adopted an amendment by Jim McGovern, D-Mass., that would make it U.S. policy to transfer combat operations to Afghanistan by the end of 2013 and other military and security operations by the end of 2014, officially ending a war that has lasted more than 12 years, with more than 2,000 U.S. troops killed, 17,000 wounded and costs amounting to nearly \$700 billion \-- or more, according to McGovern. The amendment also would require the administration to pursue negotiations to address the security and stability of Afghanistan and the broader region. 'Hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of lives lost,' McGovern said. 'It is time to end the war in Afghanistan, bring our troops home and take seriously our duty as a Congress to specifically authorize any mission and troop presence beyond 2014.' McGovern's proposal also would express the sense of Congress that if Obama determines the need to deploy U.S. troops in Afghanistan after 2014, Congress should vote on authorizing military action no later than June 2014." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/14/13](http://cq.com/doc/news-4295834)\]

-   **Supporters Said Bill Improved Readiness And Ensured U.S. Troops Have The Support And Benefits They Need.** According to a House Armed Services Committee press release, McKeon said, "For the fifty second year in a row, the House has come together - Republicans and Democrats- to do our most important work; support the troops, and provide for our common defense. This bill makes vital investments to repair our crumbling readiness, ensures our troops have the support and benefits they deserve and have earned, and institutes reforms designed to stamp out the incidents of sexual assault within the ranks. Every member can be proud of the work they have done here today." \[Press Release -- House Armed Services Committee, [6/14/13](http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=14ba2e7d-358d-474e-99af-ad0c21adda8a)\]

-   **Opponents Criticized Bill For Exceeding \$498 Billion Defense Spending Cap, Saying House Republicans' Pledge To Meet Overall \$966 Billion Cap Meant Even Further Cuts To Domestic Programs.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Many Democrats criticized the spending levels in the bill, which would exceed Pentagon requests and come at the expense of other domestic programs. With the bill, House Republicans would dramatically exceed the \$498 billion defense spending cap set under sequestration, but they plan to abide by the overall \$966 billion limit. In seeking the \$60 billion reduction to the defense bill, Nolan said it was 'time to put an end to the wars of choice and the nation building abroad and start rebuilding America.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/14/13](http://cq.com/doc/news-4295834)\]

### FY 2015

However, to meet the president\'s total request for defense, the budget circumvented the defense cap by allowing an additional \$38 billion for base defense programs to be provided through the uncapped Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) war-funding account. No additional funding was allotted for domestic programs, however. \[...\] Both the House and Senate did, however, pass and clear for the president a FY 2016 Defense Authorization bill (HR 1735) based on the GOP budget that would allow an extra \$38 billion in OCO funding to be used to boost non-war defense activities.

That would push the overall limit on defense spending next year to \$612 billion, \$1 billion short of the \$613 billion assumed in the House budget resolution adopted earlier Thursday. \[...\] The change in the budget maintains a separate \$7 billion in OCO funds for war-related State Department activities, matching President Barack Obama's request in that area." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/19/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4646438)\]

-   **Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) Argued Defense Spending Caps Imposed In 2011 Were No Longer Adequate To Meet Current Threats.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Graham said conditions around the world are 'dramatically different' now than they were when the 2011 debt limit increase law (PL 112-25) was passed, making more funding for defense imperative. That law set caps on discretionary spending through 2021, which were then lowered when a special congressional committee was unable to reach agreement on a \$1.2 trillion deficit reduction plan." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/19/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4646438)\]

-   **Democrats Objected To Raising Defense Spending Without Also Increasing Funding For Domestic Programs.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "There was little sign of intraparty rancor in the Senate, with only Democrats registering objections to the increase in defense spending without boosting domestic programs." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/19/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4646438)\]

Bernard Sanders (I-VT): "Budget Gimmickry" "Lays The Groundwork For Another War To Be Unpaid For."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Bernard Sanders, the Vermont independent who is ranking Democrat on the committee, called the amendment 'budget gimmickry' and said it 'lays the groundwork for another war to be unpaid for and I think that is a very, very bad idea.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/19/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4646438)\]

-   **Legislation Did Not Include A Dollar For Dollar Increase In Defense And Non-Defense Spending.** According to The Hill, "Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is touting this week's budget deal for breaking the rule that Democrats enforced under President Obama: Every dollar in increased defense spending had to be matched by a dollar increase for nondefense discretionary programs. 'Under the Obama rules, if you wanted to help the military, if you wanted a pay raise for the soldiers, if you wanted to buy new airplanes and new ships and more munitions, a dollar for that, you had to have a dollar domestic spending. We just broke that parity,' Ryan said at a press conference Tuesday morning. 'That's the biggest victory we could have had --- \$25 billion year over year for our military, to begin to rebuild our military, without that kind of corresponding increase in domestic discretionary spending. That, to me, is very important,' he added." \[The Hill, [5/2/17](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/331540-ryan-touts-spending-deal-for-breaking-obama-rules-for-defense)\]

It also would \[have\] provide\[d\] roughly \$34.1 billion for defense health programs. The measure would \[have\] prohibit\[ed\] use of funds to construct or modify potential facilities in the United States to house Guantanamo Bay detainees." The House passed the bill by a vote of 371 to 48.

It would \[have\] elevate\[d\] U.S. Cyber Command to an independent major command within the Defense Department. It would \[have\] prohibit\[ed\] detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, from being transferred to U.S. soil, and would \[have\] prohibit\[ed\] the closing of the main base and detention facility at Guantanamo. It would \[have\] extend\[ed\], through 2017, the authority for several bonus and special payments for military members." The vote was on the conference report. The House adopted the legislation by a vote of 375 to 34. The Senate later passed the legislation and was signed into law by the president. \[House Vote 600, [12/2/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll600.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/2/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/600?65); Congressional Actions, [S. 2943](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2943/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Did Not Include A Previously Included Rider Allowing Federal Contractors To Discriminate Against LGBT Americans And A Provision Preventing The Sage Grouse From Being Placed On The Endangered Species List.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Among the most contentious provisions stripped from the final bill is House-passed language that would have effectively permitted religiously affiliated federal contractors to discriminate against employees, critics said. Another dropped provision would have ensured that a species of bird called the greater sage grouse could not be put on the federal endangered species list, amid concerns that doing so could hem in military training ranges in the Western United States." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/8/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-5001644?16&search=HvfrcLwS); Congressional Quarterly, [9/29/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4968839?19)\]

The measure\'s spending levels are consistent with the increased defense and non-defense budget caps set by the two-year budget deal agreed to last month. That agreement increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80 billion and the non-defense cap by \$63 billion. Given that the previous caps were set to reduce overall discretionary spending by \$5 billion, the net increase provided by the omnibus is \$138 billion over the FY 2017 level."

The defense funding includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel and \$144 billion for Pentagon hardware. The domestic spending is scattered across the rest of the federal government, but lawmakers are highlighting increases in funding for infrastructure, medical research, veterans programs and efforts to combat the opioid epidemic. Civilian federal employees get a 1.9 percent pay raise, breaking parity with the military for the first time in several years." \[Washington Post, [3/22/18](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2018/03/22/heres-what-congress-is-stuffing-into-its-1-3-trillion-spending-bill/?utm_term=.51975194623a)\]

According to the New York Times, "With Mr. Trump's signature, the government will reopen before many Americans were aware it had closed, with a deal that includes about \$300 billion in additional funds over two years for military and nonmilitary programs, almost \$90 billion in disaster relief in response to last year's hurricanes and wildfires, and a higher statutory debt ceiling." In addition, according to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation "would provide funding for federal government operations and services at current levels through March 23, 2018 \[...\] \[and\] retroactively extends numerous tax breaks that expired at the end of 2016.
