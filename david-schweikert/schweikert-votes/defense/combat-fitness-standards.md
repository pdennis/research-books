# Defense Combat Fitness Standards

### Sex-Neutral Standards

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Establish Sex-Neutral Combat Fitness Standards.** In June 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "amendment no. 50 that would strike a provision regarding physical fitness standards for the Army Combat Fitness Test for combat military occupational specialties and replace it with sex-neutral physical fitness standards. It also would expand the physical fitness standards to apply to two additional military occupational specialties." The vote was on the amendment. The underlying legislation was the FY 2025 National Defense Authorization Act. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 205 to 216. \[House Vote 274, [6/13/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll274.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/13/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/274?11); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt.984](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/house-amendment/984/actions?s=a&r=34); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8070](http://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8070/all-actions)\]
