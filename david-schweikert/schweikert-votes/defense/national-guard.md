### D.C. National Guard Authority

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against An Amendment That Provided The Mayor Of D.C. The Authority Over The D.C. National Guard, Similar To The Authority Given To Governors Over Their States' National Guards.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, which would "give the mayor of the District of Columbia the same authority over the D.C. National Guard that the governors of states and territories have over their National Guards." The vote was on the adoption of an amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote 218-209. \[House Vote 323, [7/13/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll323.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/13/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/323?8); Congressional Actions, [H.Amdt. 260](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/117th-congress/house-amendment/260/actions?r=32&s=a); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7900](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7900/actions)\]
