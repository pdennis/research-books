### Defense Secretary

**2016: Schweikert Voted For A Continuing Resolution Funding The Government Through April 28, 2017; Legislation Included Expedited Senate Consideration For A Waiver For President-Elect Trump To Appoint James Mattis The Defense Secretary, Funding For The Flint Water Crisis And Funding For Anti-Opioid Addiction Grants.** In December 2016, Schweikert voted for an FY 2017 continuing resolution funding the government through April 28, 2017. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "provide\[d\] funding for federal government operations through April 28, 2017, at an annualized discretionary rate of \$1.07 trillion. The measure also would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$170 million in response to the lead-contaminated drinking water system in Flint, Mich., including \$100 million in capitalization grants for EPA's Drinking Water State Revolving Fund that the city could use to repair its drinking water infrastructure. It also would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$872 million for medical research and anti-opioid addiction grants and would \[have\] transfer\[ed\] a net \$45 million to support extending health benefits for retired coal miners for four months. It would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$10.1 billion in additional Overseas Contingency Operations funds for the Defense Department and certain other security-related accounts. The measure also would \[have\] provide\[d\] for expedited Senate consideration of legislation that would exempt President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Defense secretary, retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis, from a requirement for seven years to have passed before retired military officers can be the Pentagon chief." The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 326 to 96 and the Senate later did, sending the bill to President Obama, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 620, [12/8/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll620.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/9/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/S/161?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2028](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2028/all-actions)\]

### James Mattis

**2017: Schweikert Voted To Waive A Law Preventing President-Elect Donald Trump's Nominee, James Mattis, From Becoming The Secretary Of Defense.** In January 2017, Schweikert voted for legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "allow\[ed\] the first person to be confirmed secretary of Defense after the bill\'s enactment to serve in the position, even if the individual has not been retired from the military for seven years, so long as the person has been retired for at least three years. The bill would thus \[have\] provide\[d\] an exemption for President-elect Donald Trump's pick for the position, retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis, from a requirement for a seven-year waiting period before former servicemembers can be appointed to Defense secretary." The vote was on the legislation. The House adopted the bill by a vote of 268 to 151. Since the bill had already passed the Senate, it was then sent to the president. President Trump signed the legislation into law. \[House Vote 59, [1/13/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll059.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/13/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/59?8); Congressional Actions, [S. 84](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/84/all-actions)\]
