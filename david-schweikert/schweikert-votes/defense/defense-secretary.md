### Defense Secretary Waiver

**2021: Schweikert Voted For Waiving A Statutory Requirement Of 7 Years Of Retirement And Allowing For The Confirmation Of Retired Army Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III As Defense Secretary.** In January 2021, Schweikert voted for the Defense Secretary waiver which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "waive a statutory requirement related to date of retirement from military service for the first individual nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate as Defense secretary on or after Jan. 20, 2021. Specifically, it would make eligible such an individual who retired from active duty in the armed forces within seven years of their appointment, but not within four years. It would thus allow for the confirmation of President Joe Biden\'s Defense secretary nominee, retired Army Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 326-78 and sent to the Senate and President and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 18, [1/21/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll018.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/21/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/18?10); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 335](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/335/actions)\]

-   **Retired Army Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III Would Become The Country's First Black Defense Secretary To Lead The Pentagon.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "If confirmed by the Senate, Austin would be the nation's first Black Defense secretary. 'Mr. Austin will be the first Black person to lead the Pentagon, which is enormously important,' said House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith on the House floor, 'The military has a problem with diversity, and in addition we have a problem with white supremacy in this country. Austin is in a unique position to address these problems.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/21/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6101282?14)\]

-   **Some Lawmakers Raised Concerns Over "Civilian Control Of The Military" And Setting A Precarious Precedent By Granting Waivers To Two Continuous Administrations.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The waiver has been a point of contention throughout Austin's nomination process, as some lawmakers raised concerns about civilian control of the military, and that granting it to two administrations in a row would set a dangerous precedent that the current law is somehow optional." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/21/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6101282?14)\]
