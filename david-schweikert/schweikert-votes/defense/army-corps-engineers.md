### Water Construction Projects

Among other provisions, it would authorize 12 new projects for construction and 126 new feasibility studies. It also would add more than 560 environmental infrastructure projects to existing authorizations, including water management projects and authorize \$3 billion in new project funding for such projects. It also would authorize \$1.6 billion for 58 modifications for existing environmental infrastructure projects. The bill would establish a 10-year pilot program for alternative means of delivering water projects. It also contains numerous policy provisions, including to lower the local cost share for developing deeper ports and harbors and that allow corps recreation facilities to keep and use the recreation fees they collect." The vote was on passage.
