That agreement increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80 billion and the non-defense cap by \$63 billion. Given that the previous caps were set to reduce overall discretionary spending by \$5 billion, the net increase provided by the omnibus is \$138 billion over the FY 2017 level."

According to the Military Times, "The defense spending plan includes a 1.3 percent pay raise for both military and civilian employees starting in January. That's 0.3 percent higher than the military pay raise for 2015, but below the expected increase in average civilian wages for the third year in a row. For an E-4 with three years of service, the raise means about \$350 more in take-home pay next year. An O-4 with 12 years will get about \$1,090 more." The legislation was, according to Congressional Quarterly, a FY 2016 Omnibus Appropriations bill. The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill with an amendment.

-   **Legislation Also Increased The Basic Allowance For Housing By \$300 Million Above The White House's Request.** According to the Military Times, "The funding plan also boosts military Basic Allowance for Housing funds by \$300 million above the White House\'s request but goes along with a Pentagon plan to slow BAH growth to cover only 98 percent of average local rent costs next year, with troops paying the other 2 percent out of pocket." \[Military Times, [12/16/15](http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/2015/12/16/budget-omnibus-fy16-defense-veterans-affairs-pentagon/77416466/)\]
