### Urging Health Care Nutrition Training

**2022: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Urging Medical Schools Other Health Professional Training Programs To Incorporate Nutrition Education And Trainings That Portray The Connection Between Nutrition And Disease.** In May 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the adoption of the rule, which would "provide for automatic agreement, upon adoption of the rule, to a resolution (H Res 1118) that would express the sense of Congress that the United States should urge medical schools and other health professional training programs to incorporate nutrition education that demonstrates the connection between nutrition and disease and training related to nutrition interventions and referrals; support research on nutrition education and the dissemination of related curricular resources for health professional training programs; and raise awareness of the role of nutrition in health and the responsibility of health professionals to provide patient education and counseling about nutrition." The vote was on the adoption of the rule. The House adopted the rule by a vote of 220-199, thus the resolution was automatically adopted. \[House Vote 187, [5/17/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll187.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/17/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/187?0); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 1118](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/1118/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 1119](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/1119/actions)\]
