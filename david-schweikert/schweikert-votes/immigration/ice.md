-   **The Memorandum Ended ICE's Worksite Enforcement Operations, Which Enforced Immigration Law At A Migrant's Workplace.** According to the Center for Immigration Studies, "on October 12, 2021, Mayorkas issued a separate policy, titled 'Worksite Enforcement: The Strategy to Protect the American Labor Market, the Conditions of the American Worksite, and the Dignity of the Individual', which severely restricts officers' ability to enforce immigration law at an alien's place of employment.25 This policy specifically ended ICE's practice of conducting worksite enforcement operations and directed the agency to consider "exercising prosecutorial discretion" to workers who witness or experience worksite exploitation." \[Center For Immigration Studies, [1/31/23](https://cis.org/Report/Two-Years-Bidens-Immigration-Policies)\]
