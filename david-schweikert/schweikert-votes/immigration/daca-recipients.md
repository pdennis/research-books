# DACA Recipients

### Employment

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Allowing Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals Recipients To Be Employed By Legislative Branch Agencies.** In July 2021, Schweikert voted against the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2022 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "authorize legislative branch agencies to hire individuals with employment authorization under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program; require the AOC to remove from public spaces in the Capitol all Confederate statues and busts, as well as those representing former Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, Vice President John C. Calhoun, and others." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 215-207. \[House Vote 239, [7/28/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll239.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/28/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/239?39); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4346](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4346/actions)\]
