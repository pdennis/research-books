# Afghan Special Immigrant Visas

### Extension

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Extending The Afghan Special Immigrant Visa Program By One Year And The Visa Application Deadline Through 2024.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, which would "extend the Afghan special immigrant visa program by one year, extending the application deadline through 2024." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote 329-101, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate did not take substantive action on the legislation. The FY 2023 Defense Authorization was passed with H.R. 7776. \[House Vote 350, [7/14/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll350.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/14/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/350?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7900](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7900/actions)\]
