# Executive Actions

### 2014

**2014: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against An Amendment That Would Ensure That Nothing Found In The Underlying Bill Overturning President Obama's 2014 Immigration Orders Would Impact Current Exemptions To Certain Family Members Of The Armed Forces, Domestic Violence Victims Or Cuban Nationals.** In December 2014, Schweikert effectively voted against an amendment ensuring current protections for certain undocumented immigrant family members of U.S. military personnel, domestic violence victims or Cuban nationals would still be protected. According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would, "ensure that nothing in bill would impact current exemptions for parents, spouses and children of U.S. citizens who are current members or veterans of the U.S. armed forces, the reserve or those who seek to enlist in the armed forces. It also would maintain exemptions for victims of domestic violence who have successfully petitioned for relief under the Violence Against Women Act, victims of crimes and serious forms of human trafficking and Cuban nationals." The underlying bill would prohibit the executive branch from carrying out President Obama's immigration executive action. The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion 194 to 225. \[House Vote 549, [12/4/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll549.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/4/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/h/549?6); Congressional Quarterly, [5/4/14](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/h/550?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5759](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/5759/all-actions)\]

### DACA

**2018: Schweikert Voted Against The So-Called Compromise GOP Immigration Will That Funded The Wall, Provided A Pathway To Citizenship For DACA Recipients, And Increased Asylum Requirements For Those Seeking It.** In June 2018, Schweikert voted against the "compromise" immigration proposal between Republican conservatives and moderates. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Passage of the bill that would appropriate \$23.4 billion for various border security activities. Included would be \$16.6 billion for a 'border wall system,' which would be available from fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2027, and \$6.8 billion for border security investments, which would be available from fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2023. It would provide those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status a six-year renewable contingent non-immigrant legal status and would allow them to apply for a green card after five years, providing a path to citizenship. It would modify legal immigration by ending the diversity visa program and reallocating those visas to other classifications. The bill would require that undocumented immigrants who are charged with a misdemeanor offense for improper entry into the United States be detained with their minor children." The vote was on passage. The House rejected the bill by a vote of 121 to 301. \[House Vote 297, [6/27/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll297.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/27/18](http://cq.com/vote/2018/H/297?0); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 6136](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6136/all-actions)\]

**2018: Schweikert Voted For A Republican Immigration Reform Measure Which Provided \$9.3 Billion In Wall Funding, A Three-Year Renewable Temporary Status For DACA Recipients, And Reduced Overall Legal Immigration By Ending The Diversity Visa Program And Restricting Family-Based Immigration.** In June 2018, Schweikert voted for a conservative immigration reform bill. Acceding to Congressional Quarterly, "Passage of the bill that would authorize \$24.8 billion for fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022 for various border security activities, including \$9.3 billion for a border wall and other physical barriers and would provide individuals registered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program with a three-year, renewable contingent non-immigrant legal status but with no special path to citizenship. It would modify legal immigration by ending the diversity visa program and restricting most family-based immigration to allow only spouses and minor children of legal permanent residents to receive green cards. It would increase enforcement of immigration laws within the United States, including by requiring all employers to verify the immigration status and eligibility of individuals seeking jobs in the United States." The vote was on passage. The House rejected the bill by a vote of 193 to 231. \[House Vote 282, [6/21/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll282.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/18](http://cq.com/vote/2018/H/282?0); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4760](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4760/all-actions)\]

**2018: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Condemning Rep. Paul Gosar's (R-AZ) Comments Asking Law Enforcement To Check Citizenship At The State Of The Union In Response To Democrats Bringing Undocumented Immigrants To The Event.** In February 2018, Schweikert voted to kill a resolution that would, according to the text of the resolution, "Resolved, That the House of Representatives strongly condemns Representative Paul Gosar for his inappropriate actions that intimidated State of the Union guests and discredited the House of Representatives." The vote was on a motion to table the resolution. The House agreed to the motion, essentially killing the legislation by a vote of 231 to 187. \[House Vote 53, [2/6/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll053.xml); Congress.gov, [H.

-   **Rep. Gosar Contacted The Capital Police And The Attorney General To Consider Checking ID Of Everyone Attending The State Of The Union.** According to the Washington Post, "Democratic lawmakers and activists frustrated with the pace at which Congress is moving on protections for 'dreamers,' undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, often point to fears of deportation. Stories of undocumented immigrants being arrested at courthouses while seeking protections from crimes or meeting with officers to apply for legal residency have only stoked those fears. Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.) tweeted that he contacted the U.S. Capitol Police and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ask law enforcement to consider checking the identification of all attending the State of the Union address. The hard-line conservative even called for arresting 'any illegal aliens in attendance.'" \[Washington Post, [1/30/18](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/30/rep-paul-gosar-wants-illegal-aliens-arrested-at-the-state-of-the-union-that-likely-wont-help-the-gop-with-latinos/?utm_term=.afef20250cc1)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Prevent An Extension Of The Program Allowing DACA Immigrants To Join The Military.** In June 2016, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "bar\[red\] use of funds to extend the expiration date of a Sept. 25, 2014, memo that allowed undocumented immigrants granted deferral of deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to be eligible for military enlistment through the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program." The underlying legislation was an FY 2017 defense appropriations. The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 207 to 214. \[House Vote 318, [6/16/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll318.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/16/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/318?32); Congressional Actions, [H.

**2016: Schweikert Voted Against Extending Or Reissuing A Defense Memo Which Allowed Individuals Granted Deportation Reprieve Under The Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals Program To Be Eligible To Enlist In The U.S. Military.** In June 2016, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] use of funds to extend the expiration date of, or to reissue with a new expiration date, a Sept. 25, 2014, memo that allowed undocumented immigrants granted deferral of deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to be eligible for military enlistment through the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program." The underlying legislation was an FY 2017 defense appropriation. The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 210 to 211. \[House Vote 317, [6/16/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll317.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/16/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/317?75); Congressional Actions, [H.

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Provide \$46.1 Billion To Fund Federal Homeland Security And Disaster Relief Programs In Fiscal Year 2014 And Voted To Block President Obama's Deferred Deportation Policy For Some DREAMers.** In June 2013, Schweikert voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, would have "provide\[d\] \$46.1 billion in fiscal 2014 for the Homeland Security Department and related activities. The bill include\[d\] \$10.6 billion for Customs and Border Protection; \$5.4 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement; \$7.2 billion for the Transportation Security Administration, including fees; \$9.9 billion for the Coast Guard; \$1.6 billion for the Secret Service and \$9.9 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, including \$5.6 billion for emergency disaster relief. It also \[would have\] prohibit\[ed\] federal funding for ICE to provide for abortions for detainees, except in cases where the life of the woman would be endangered or in the case of rape or incest." The vote was on final passage. The House approved the bill on a vote of 245 to 182, but died in the Senate. \[House Vote 211, [6/6/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll211.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/6/13](http://cq.com/doc/floorvote-239811000); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2217](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2217/all-actions)\]

-   **Bill Exceeded Debt-Limit Deal's Spending Cap By Two Percent.** According to the Associated Press, "The House on Thursday passed a \$45 billion measure boosting the Homeland Security Department\'s budget by about 2 percent above spending levels imposed by an ongoing round of automatic budgets cuts." \[Associated Press, [6/6/13](http://timesfreepress.com/news/2013/jun/06/house-passes-45-billion-homeland-security-spending/?print)\]

-   **Democrats Opposed Bill After Republicans Added Provision Blocking Administration's Deferred Deportation Policy For Some DREAMers.** According to the Associated Press, "Democrats had been poised to support the bill but mostly withheld support after Republicans muscled through an amendment that would block the administration\'s policy to end deportation of hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the country illegally who were brought to the United States as children." \[Associated Press, [6/6/13](http://timesfreepress.com/news/2013/jun/06/house-passes-45-billion-homeland-security-spending/?print)\]

-   **Higher Spending Part Of Republican Plan To Shift Funding From Domestic Programs To Defense.** According to the Associated Press, "The White House has promised to veto the measure because it's part of a broader GOP strategy that embraces deep spending cuts and shifts scarce resources from domestic programs to the Pentagon. \[...\] GOP leaders are employing a strategy in which the more generous bills at levels close to those requested by Obama in his April budget are advancing first. Bills with sweeping cuts to domestic programs and foreign aid won\'t come until later, though Democrats are skeptical GOP leaders will force their rank and file to vote for cuts to popular programs like education, community development grants, transportation and federal law enforcement." \[Associated Press, [6/6/13](http://timesfreepress.com/news/2013/jun/06/house-passes-45-billion-homeland-security-spending/?print)\]

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Block President Obama's Order Deferring Deportation For DREAMers.** In June 2013, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have blocked President Obama's executive decision not to deport illegal immigrants who came to America as children, known as DREAMers. According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have "bar\[red\] the use of funds provided in the \[underlying\] bill to finalize, implement, administer, or enforce a number of policies and memorandums within the Homeland Security Department, including ones pertaining to prosecutorial discretion for illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children." The House approved the proposed amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2014 by a vote of 224 to 201. The House later passed the overall bill, but it died in the Senate. \[House Vote 208, [6/6/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll208.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/6/13](http://cq.com/doc/floorvote-239805000); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 136](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/136/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2217](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2217/all-actions)\]

-   **Proposed DREAM Act Would Permit Certain Young Undocumented Immigrants Who Came To The U.S. As Children To Temporarily Remain In The Country, And, If They Later Went To College Or Served In The U.S. Military, Be Eligible For Permanent Legal Status.** According to the National Immigration Law Center, "The DREAM Act is bipartisan legislation that addresses the tragedy of young people who grew up in the United States and have graduated from our high schools, but whose future is circumscribed by our current immigration laws. Under current law, these young people generally derive their immigration status solely from their parents, and if their parents are undocumented or in immigration limbo, most have no mechanism to obtain legal residency, even if they have lived most of their lives in the U.S. The DREAM Act would provide such a mechanism for those who are able to meet certain conditions. \[. . .\] The DREAM Act would enact two major changes in current law: The DREAM Act would permit certain immigrant students who have grown up in the U.S. to apply for temporary legal status and to eventually obtain permanent legal status and become eligible for U.S. citizenship if they go to college or serve in the U.S. military; and The \[sic\] DREAM Act would eliminate a federal provision that penalizes states that provide in-state tuition without regard to immigration status." \[National Immigration Law Center, [5/1/11](http://nilc.org/dreamsummary.html)\]

-   **June, 2012: Obama Issued Executive Order That Suspended Deportations For Certain DREAM Act-Eligible Students And Made Them Eligible For Certain Work Permits.** According to Huffington Post, "The Obama administration responded to years of pressure from immigrants rights groups on Friday with an announcement that it will stop deportations and begin granting work permits for some Dream Act-eligible students. \[. . .\] Some 800,000 people are expected to come forward to receive deferred action from deportation, as first reported by the Associated Press on Friday morning. The policy change will apply to young undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children, along the same lines as the Dream Act, a decade-old bill that passed in the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate in 2010." \[Huffington Post, [6/15/12](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/15/obama-immigration-order-deportation-dream-act_n_1599658.html)\]

-   **Eligible Undocumented Immigrants Must Be Under 30, Have Arrived In The U.S. Before Age Of 16, Lived In The Country Continuously For Five Years, And Have Graduated From High School, Gotten Their GED, Or Served In The Military, And Have At Most A Minor Misdemeanor Conviction.** According to the Department of Homeland Security, "The following criteria should be satisfied before an individual is considered for an exercise of prosecutorial discretion pursuant to this memorandum: came to the United States under the age of sixteen; has continuously resided in the United States for a least five years preceding the date of this memorandum and is present in the United States on the date of this memorandum; is currently in school, has graduated from high school, has obtained a general education development certificate, or is an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States; has not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, multiple misdemeanor offenses, or otherwise poses a threat to national security or public safety; and is not above the age of thirty." \[Department of Homeland Security, [6/15/12](http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/MEMO.pdf)\]

-   **Eligible Undocumented Immigrants Do Not Receive Any Legal Immigration Status, Or Move Closer To Becoming Permanent Residents; And Deferrals Under The Program Could End When A New President Takes Office.** According to CNN, "Dubbed Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the deferral program was created in June under an executive order signed by President Barack Obama. However, there is no guarantee of its future if Obama is not re-elected. Republican Mitt Romney would then have the power to revoke the order. The program also does not guarantee public benefits to successful applicants. That allowed Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer to issue an executive order Wednesday directing state agencies to deny benefits \-- including driver\'s licenses \-- to deferred action recipients. \[. . .\] Mayorkas reiterated Tuesday that deferred action does not provide lawful status or a shortcut to permanent residency or citizenship." \[CNN, [8/15/12](http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/15/us/immigration-deferred-deportation/)\]

-   **As Of The End Of August, 2013, Nearly 600,000 People Have Applied For Deferred Action Through August 2013, And 455,000 Have Received Final Approval.** According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, over 588,000 people have applied for deferred action through the new program. Over 567,000 have been initially accepted and over 455,000 have completed both the biometric and case review process for final approval. \[U.S. Citizenship And Immigration Services, [9/11/13](http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigration%20Forms%20Data/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/daca-13-9-11.pdf)\]

-   **Rep. Steve King, The Amendment's Sponsor, Said Congress Needed To Act In Order To Protect Its Authority To Set Immigration Policy.** According to the Huffington Post, "King said on the House floor Wednesday that the amendment is necessary to check the administration's deportation discretion. 'Whatever people think of the impending immigration policy here in the United States, we cannot allow the executive branch to usurp the legislative authority of the United States Congress,' King said. 'If we allow that to happen in immigration, it could happen to anything.'" \[Huffington Post, [6/6/13](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/06/steve-king-amendment-deport_n_3397126.html)\]

-   **Rep. King Also Said Those Who Would Benefit From The Deferral Program And The DREAM Act Included Drug Smugglers As Well As Valedictorians.** According to Politico, "The Iowa Republican said the possibility of legalizing valedictorians wasn't worth also legalizing drug smugglers. 'There are valedictorians in this group and my heart goes out to them, but not to the point where I'd sacrifice the rule of law and legalize a lot of bad elements in the process,' King said. 'As much sympathy as I have for especially the valedictorians, but some of them are not capable of being valedictorians and they should have some of our sympathy, too. But as much sympathy as we have for them, we cannot sacrifice the rule of law,' he added. 'Our sympathy should not outweigh the rule of law, so we should not deconstruct America because the way that some of these kids have been characterized pulls at our heartstrings.' King's initial remarks came in an interview last week with Newsmax. While discussing the DREAM Act, which would allow children brought to the country illegally by their parents to qualify for citizenship, King said supporters were incorrectly depicting the children as valedictorians." \[Politico, [7/24/13](http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/steve-king-drug-remarks-94669.html)\]

-   **Amendment's Opponents Defended Executive Order, Said Children Should Not Be Held Responsible For Their Parents' Actions.** According to the Huffington Post, "Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) gave a forceful defense on the House floor on Wednesday of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. 'We should not hold children responsible for the actions of adults and of their parents,' he said. 'We should give them an opportunity and that is what this executive order has done.'" \[Huffington Post, [6/6/13](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/06/steve-king-amendment-deport_n_3397126.html)\]

### Overturning Attemps

**2015: Schweikert Voted For An Amendment That Would Effectively Prevent DREAMers From Serving In The United States Military.** In May 2015, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would help prevent the Secretary of Defense from reviewing if DREAMers could enlist in the armed forces. According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment, "would strike the section of the bill that would express the sense of the House that the Defense secretary should review current law to determine whether individuals participating in President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program may enlist in the armed forces." According to Rep. Ruben Gellego (D-AZ), the amendment would, "leave the deeply unjust status quo unchanged. Right now, in America, DREAMers can be drafted into the military, but they can\'t sign up to serve in the military force they choose. That is simply unacceptable. These young people are Americans in every respect, except on paper." The underlying bill was FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act. The vote was on the amendment. The House adopted by a vote of 221 to 202 and subsequently passed the amended bill. After the Senate passed its own version, the bill went to a conference committee. The resulting compromise version did not contain the provision struck by the amendment. Both the House and the Senate subsequently passed the legislation; however, the president vetoed the bill and was not overridden. \[House Vote 229, [5/14/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll229.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/14/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/229?1); Congressional Record, [5/14/15](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2015/05/14/CREC-2015-05-14-pt1-PgH2999-3.pdf#page=165); House Report 114-270, [9/29/15](https://www.congress.gov/114/crpt/hrpt270/CRPT-114hrpt270.pdf); White House Press Briefing, [9/30/15](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/10/01/press-briefing-press-secretary-josh-earnest-9302015); Congressional Actions, [H.

### Overturning Attempts

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Authorize The Speaker Of The House To File An Amicus Curiae In The Supreme Court Case United States V. Texas Which Dealt With President Obama's November 2014 Executive Actions.** In March 2016, Schweikert voted for a House resolution that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "authorize\[d\] the Speaker of the House to appear as amicus curiae in the case of United States, et al. v. Texas, et al. The case, which will be argued in front of the United States Supreme Court, was brought by 26 states against the Obama administration for its November 2014 executive actions that would defer deportation and provide work permits for illegal immigrants." The vote was on passage of the House resolution. The House passed the legislation by a vote of 234 to 186. No further action was required. \[House Vote 129, [3/17/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll129.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [Congressional Actions](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/129?44), [H. Res. 639](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-resolution/639/all-actions)\]

-   **Nov. 2014: President Obama Ordered Immigration Authorities To Not Deport -- And To Potentially Provide Work Permits To -- Undocumented Parents Of U.S. Citizens And Permanent Residents Who Have Been In The U.S. Since January 1, 2010.** According to The Washington Post, "The executive action will have two key components: It would offer a legal reprieve to the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who've resided in the country for at least five years. This would remove the constant threat of deportation. Many could also receive work permits." According to the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services website, "These initiatives include \[...\] \[a\]llowing parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to request deferred action and employment authorization for three years, in a new Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, provided they have lived in the United States continuously since January 1, 2010, and pass required background checks." \[Washington Post, [11/20/14](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/19/your-complete-guide-to-obamas-immigration-order/); U.S. Customs and Immigration Services website, [1/30/15](http://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction)\]

-   **Obama Also Expanded The Deferred Action Program For Young DREAMers That He Started In 2012 To Cover DREAMers Of Any Age, Rather Than Limiting The Program To Those Under The Age Of 30.** According to The Washington Post, "It would expand the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that allowed young immigrants, under 30 years old, who arrived as children to apply for a deportation deferral and who are now here legally. Immigrants older than 30 now qualify, as do more recent arrivals." \[Washington Post, [11/20/14](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/19/your-complete-guide-to-obamas-immigration-order/)\]

-   **Republicans Argued Obama's Orders Were Illegal.** According to The New York Times, "Conservative lawmakers accused the president of abusing his office --- Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority leader, called it a 'brazen power grab' --- and promised a fight when the Republicans take full control of Congress next year. \[...\] Several Republicans on Thursday said they wanted to use a coming spending bill and the threat of a government shutdown as leverage against Mr. Obama, while others in the party reached for ways that Congress might undercut the president's actions by withholding money or threatening other priorities. 'By ignoring the will of the American people, President Obama has cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left,' House Speaker John A. Boehner said in a statement after \[Obama's\] speech \[announcing the actions\]." \[New York Times, [11/20/14](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/us/obama-immigration-speech.html)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Bar Funds From Being Used By The Administration In The Lawsuit Challenging The President's Executive Orders On Immigration.** In June 2015, Schweikert voted for an amendment barring the use of funds by the administration for the state of Texas et al. v. United States of America et al. court case. According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have "bar\[red\] funds made available by the bill from being used with respect to the case State of Texas, et al. v. United States of America, et al., in which 26 states are suing the Obama administration over its executive actions on immigration." The underlying legislation was H.R. 2578, the FY 2016 Commerce, Justice and related agencies appropriations bill. The vote was on the amendment. The House agreed to the amendment by a vote of 224 to 204. The underlying bill passed the House, but it but died in the Senate after an attempt at becoming a vehicle for a different appropriations bill. \[House Vote 293, [6/3/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll293.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/3/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/293?22); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **November 2015: 26 States Sued The Administration Over President Obama's Executive Action On Immigration.** According to the Huffington Post, "More than half of U.S. states are now involved in a lawsuit to stop President Barack Obama\'s executive actions on immigration, with the addition of Nevada and Tennessee announced Monday by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The 26 states challenging Obama\'s actions are led by Texas, which filed its lawsuit in December. The lawsuit contends Obama overstepped his constitutional authority in executive actions on immigration that may provide deportation relief and work authorization for up to 5 million people." \[Huffington Post, [1/16/15](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/26/states-lawsuit-immigration_n_6550840.html); Appeal, Case No. 15-40238, Filed 11/9/15\]

Although the president\'s move infuriated conservatives, who wanted to use the year-end spending package to force a showdown with the president on the issue, GOP leaders sought to delay such a showdown until the new year when the new Congress convened and Republicans controlled both chambers. Consequently, Congress in December enacted a FY 2015 omnibus appropriations measure \[...\] that provided full, detailed spending bills for the remainder of FY 2015 for 11 of the 12 individual appropriations measures --- but which funded the Homeland Security Department through a CR only until Feb. 27 in order to give lawmakers an opportunity to respond to the president\'s immigration actions." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/12/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4601771?10)\]

However, the drop in revenues would be greater than the drop in direct spending. Deficits for the unified budget would increase by \$7.5 billion over the 2015-2025 period, as compared to projected deficits under current law. As the majority of the forgone revenue would be for Social Security payroll taxes, enacting sections 579 and 580 would increase the off-budget deficit by about \$16.3 billion over that same period. In contrast, the on-budget deficit would improve by \$8.8 billion over the 2015-2025 period." \[Letter from CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf to Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran (R-MS), [1/29/15](http://www.cq.com/pdf/4614090)\]

-   **Congressional Budget Office (CBO): Provisions Blocking Obama's Immigration Orders Would Increase Net Budget Deficit (Including Off-Budget Programs Like Social Security) By \$7.5 Billion Over 10 Years.** According to the Congressional Budget Office, "Under H.R. 240, as passed by the House, both revenues and direct spending would be lower than under current law. However, the drop in revenues would be greater than the drop in direct spending. Deficits for the unified budget would increase by \$7.5 billion over the 2015-2025 period, as compared to projected deficits under current law. As the majority of the forgone revenue would be for Social Security payroll taxes, enacting sections 579 and 580 would increase the off-budget deficit by about \$16.3 billion over that same period. In contrast, the on-budget deficit would improve by \$8.8 billion over the 2015-2025 period." \[Letter from CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf to Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran (R-MS), [1/29/15](http://www.cq.com/pdf/4614090)\]

**2014: Schweikert Voted Against Funding The Department Of Homeland Security At FY 2014 Levels Through February 27, 2015, As Part Of Legislation Providing FY 2015 Funding For The Rest Of The Government.** In December 2014, Schweikert voted against legislation that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "finance\[d\] government operations through Sept. 30 \[2015\], the remainder of FY 2015, through full, detailed, annual appropriations bills for all spending measures except Homeland Security --- which would be funded by a continuing resolution until Feb. 27. \[...\] Funding for the Homeland Security Department would remain effectively frozen at the FY 2014 level by a continuing resolution (CR) through Feb. 27, 2015." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate Amendment with an Amendment. The House agreed to the motion 219 to 206. The Senate agreed to by a vote of 56 to 40. Afterwards, the amended legislation was sent to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 563, [12/11/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll563.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/10/14](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4588146); Public Law 113-235, [12/16/14](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ235/PLAW-113publ235.pdf); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 83](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/83/all-actions)\]

This would remove the constant threat of deportation. Many could also receive work permits." According to the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services website, "These initiatives include \[...\] \[a\]llowing parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to request deferred action and employment authorization for three years, in a new Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, provided they have lived in the United States continuously since January 1, 2010, and pass required background checks." \[Washington Post, [11/20/14](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/19/your-complete-guide-to-obamas-immigration-order/); U.S. Customs and Immigration Services website, [1/30/15](http://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction)\]

-   **By Only Providing Temporary Funding For DHS, GOP Leaders Deferred A Clash Over Obama's Orders Until After They Had Taken Control Of The Senate, And Avoided A Post-Election Government Shutdown.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Efforts to develop and pass a year-end spending package ran into trouble almost immediately after the election, however, when President Obama in mid-November announced executive actions on immigration that the White House said would prevent nearly 5 million illegal immigrants from being deported. The move infuriated conservative Republicans, with many calling for Congress to take immediate action against the president, including by attaching language to any year-end funding bill --- setting the stage for another possible government shutdown. GOP leaders, however, fresh off their electoral victories and eager to show that they can effectively govern, want to avoid a government shutdown like the one last year that was politically damaging to the party and are instead taking actions to delay a showdown over the president's immigration actions until next year, when they will control both chambers of Congress. The omnibus appropriations measure that has been devised provides full, detailed spending bills for the remainder of FY 2015 for 11 of the 12 individual appropriations measures, ensuring that most of the government won\'t be threatened by a shutdown. Funding for the 12th measure --- for the Homeland Security Department, which includes the primary agencies that will carry out the president\'s executive actions on immigration --- would be provided through a temporary continuing resolution that expires Feb. 27, 2015, providing Congress with an opportunity early next year to address the president\'s actions." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/10/14](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4588146)\]

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Prohibit The Executive Branch From Carrying Out President Obama's Immigration Executive Action.** In December 2014, Schweikert voted for prohibiting the executive branch from carrying out President Obama's immigration executive action. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Passage of the bill \[...\] would prohibit the executive branch from exempting or deferring from deportation any immigrants considered to be unlawfully present in the United States. It also would prohibit the administration from treating those immigrants as if they were lawfully present or had lawful immigration status. It would specify that any action taken by the executive branch to circumvent the measure\'s prohibitions would be 'null and void and without legal effect.' " The bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 219 to 197. The bill died in the Senate. \[House Vote 550, [12/3/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll550.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/3/14](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4583307/2?18&search=kbSJt6FP); Congressional Quarterly, [12/4/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2014/h/550?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5759](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/5759/all-actions)\]

-   **Opponents Of The Bill Claim That The Authority Obama Claims For Deferred Action Is Similar To Previous Presidents, Is A Step In Fixing Broken Immigration Policies And Allows More Individuals To Contribute To The Economy.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents of the bill contend that the president\'s actions are constitutional and are similar to those taken by previous presidents. The House\'s refusal during the past two years to allow a vote on bipartisan Senate legislation left the administration no choice but to issue executive action. Rather than trying to address the issue, opponents say, Republicans were more interested in playing partisan politics and, in doing so, allowing millions of productive families to languish in the shadows. The president\'s new program takes a critical step in fixing our broken immigration system by prioritizing immigration enforcement against criminals and national security threats while holding nearly 5 million undocumented immigrants accountable by deferring deportation only if they register, pass a criminal background check and pay back taxes --- thereby allowing them to contribute to the U.S. economy." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/3/14](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4583307/2?18&search=kbSJt6FP)\]

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Effectively End President Obama's Deportation Deferral Program For DREAMers.** In August 2014, Schweikert voted for a bill that, according a post on Roll Call's 218 blog, "would effectively end Deferred Actions for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA --- a program that has allowed hundreds of thousands of 'Dreamers' brought to the United States illegally by their parents to get work permits and avoid deportation. And it would prohibit the president from expanding the program, as he has been reportedly considering doing for as many as five million additional immigrants." The House passed the bill by a vote of 216 to 192; however, as of mid-August 2014, the Senate has not taken any substantive action on the measure. \[House Vote 479, [8/1/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll479.xml); Dumain post, Roll Call's 218 blog, [8/1/14](http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/republicans-vote-to-end-daca/); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5272](https://congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/5272/all-actions)\]

-   **House Leaders Allowed Vote On Bill In Exchange For House Conservatives' Support Of Border Supplemental Funding Bill.** According to a post on Roll Call's 218 blog, "\[T\]he measure, brought to the House floor as a reward for conservative members who agreed to help pass a \$694 million appropriations bill to address the child migrant border surge just an hour earlier, will be an important messaging vote for both parties heading into the November midterm elections." \[Dumain post, Roll Call's 218 blog, [8/1/14](http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/republicans-vote-to-end-daca/)\]

-   **Bill's Supporters Argued DACA And Other Unauthorized Presidential Actions Had Helped Create Child Migrant Crisis.** According to a post on Roll Call's 218 blog, "Republicans who voted 'yes' will be able to tell their base they voted against Obama's executive overreach, which they argue helped spur the record influx of unaccompanied minors at the U.S.-Mexico border that has overwhelmed enforcement agencies. 'It sends a vitally important message that minors wanting to come here in the future will ... have absolutely no opportunity to receive DACA benefits,' said Judiciary Chairman Robert W. Goodlatte, R-Va., during floor debate Friday evening. \[...\] Republicans shot back \[at Democrats' attacks on the bill\], saying that they were not acting out of insensitivity, but out of concern for the separation of powers that Obama, in executing DACA, has allegedly disregarded. 'You failed to act, so don't point your fingers at us!' Rep. Raúl R. Labrador, R-Idaho, told Democrats, who during their control of the House, Senate and White House did not enact comprehensive immigration overhaul legislation" (non-bracketed ellipsis in original). \[Dumain post, Roll Call's 218 blog, [8/1/14](http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/republicans-vote-to-end-daca/)\]

-   **Democrats Accused The Bill's Supporters Of Being Anti-Immigrant And Anti-Latino.** According to a post on Roll Call's 218 blog, "The measure sparked one of the most vitriolic debates in recent memory. Democrats hurled accusations of xenophobia, cowardice and racism against Republicans. At times, they sat back in their seats on their side of the aisle in the House chamber and smirked, sarcastically applauding some of their biggest foes like Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa. During other moments, they booed. "In January you were saying that all of the Dreamers should get green cards and citizenship,' Rep. Luis V. Gutiérrez, D-Ill., charged in a scathing floor speech. 'Now, Steve King, Michele Bachmann and Ted Cruz are literally writing the immigration script for the Republican Party.' 'This is one of the most mean-spirited and anti-immigrant pieces of legislation I have seen in all my years of Congress,' said Judiciary ranking member John Conyers Jr., D-Mich." \[Dumain post, Roll Call's 218 blog, [8/1/14](http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/republicans-vote-to-end-daca/)\]

-   **Some Republicans Said They Opposed Simply Deporting DREAMers, But Agreed That The DACA Program Was An Illegal Use Of Presidential Power And Should Be Repudiated.** According to a post on Roll Call's 218 blog, "Not every Republican voted 'yes' on the bill on Friday night, but dissenters did not speak up on the House floor during debate. They chose instead to voice their frustrations in conversations with colleagues outside the parameters of the chamber, saying the decision to hold the vote was not politically advisable but stopping short of using the stormy rhetoric of their Democratic counterparts. The challenge for some Republicans during this debate was that they agree that Obama has overstepped his constitutional bounds, but they support the general concept that the Dreamers should have some protections against deportation and pathways to legal status. Diaz-Balart, who for the past year and a half had been fighting for his fellow Republicans to rally behind some version of comprehensive immigration overhaul legislation --- and represents a heavily Latino and immigrant constituency in Miami --- articulated that tension. 'I will be voting against this issue of DACA, but I don't criticize folks for being concerned about the president overstepping his constitutional boundary,' he told reporters Friday morning." \[Dumain post, Roll Call's 218 blog, [8/1/14](http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/republicans-vote-to-end-daca/)\]
