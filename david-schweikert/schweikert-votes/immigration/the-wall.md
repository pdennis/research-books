# The Wall

### Funding

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The House GOP's FY 2018 Omnibus That Included Funding For Trump's Wall.** In September 2017, Schweikert voted for an FY 2018 Omnibus appropriations bill that. According to The Hill, "The House on Thursday completed its work on the annual appropriations bills for 2018, ahead of expected negotiations at the end of this year to keep the government funded. By a vote of 211-198, the House passed a \$1.2 trillion package of spending bills to fund wide swaths of the federal government, ranging from the Department of Homeland Security to the Environmental Protection Agency. \[...\] The package included eight new bills, plus four previously passed appropriations bills that advanced through the House in July. Regular order for appropriations typically involved passing each of the bills individually, not in groups of 4 or 8. \[...\] Together, the bills appropriate \$621.5 billion for defense spending and \$511 billion for nondefense discretionary spending. It also devotes another \$87 billion in Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) funding, which does not count toward budget cuts. Of that, \$75 billion went to defense, \$12 billion to nondefense." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 211 to 198. The Senate took no substantive action on the overall legislation. \[House Vote 528, [9/14/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll528.xml); The Hill, [9/14/17](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/350670-house-passes-12t-government-funding-package-for-2018); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3354](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3354/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Included \$1.6 Billion For Trump's Border Wall.** According to The Hill, "Lawmakers passed a national security-themed spending package in July comprised of the other four annual appropriations bills. It included a \$1.6 billion down payment to begin construction on a U.S.-Mexico border wall, a top priority for President Trump. Trump pledged during the 2016 campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall, a suggestion rejected by the Mexican government." \[The Hill, [9/14/17](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/350670-house-passes-12t-government-funding-package-for-2018)\]
