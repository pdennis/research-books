**2015: Schweikert Was Absent During A Vote On Formally Creating The U.S. Customs And Border Protection In Statute As Part Of A Customs And Implementing An Automated Process For Imports And Exports In A Customs And Trade Enforcement Bill.** In December 2015, Schweikert missed a vote on legislation that formally established the CBP in statute as part of a customs and trade enforcement bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "formally establish\[ed\] U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in statute and authorizing the implementation of an automated system for CBP to process imports and exports." The underlying legislation was a conference report that would have "formally establish\[ed\] the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and authorize\[d\] the CBP to use an automated import-export processing system \[...\] strengthen\[ed\] enforcement of intellectual property rights and \[...\] would \[have\] permanently ban\[ned\] state and local taxation of Internet access and ends grandfathered Internet access taxation in seven states." The vote was on the conference report. The House passed the legislation by a vote of 256 to 158. The Senate then passed the bill, which was signed into law by the president. \[House Vote 693, [12/11/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll693.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/11/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll693.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/10/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4804827?20&search=oNzJXGtv); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 644](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/644/all-actions)\]

The underlying legislation "require\[d\] semiannual currency reports on nations that are major U.S. trading partners and would direct the administration to take specific steps if it finds that a country is manipulating its currency; and would \[have\] amend\[ed\] a Trade Promotion Authority bill (to take effect as if included in enactment) to include additional trade negotiating objectives, including that trade agreements not include provisions on immigration or climate change." The vote was on a motion to concur with the Senate amendments with an amendment. The House agreed to the amendment by a vote of 240 to 190. The House and Senate later conferenced, and a final version of the bill, with some similar provisions, was signed into law. \[House Vote 363, [6/12/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll363.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/11/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4704138?4); Congressional Quarterly, [6/12/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/363?47); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 644](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/644/all-actions)\]

It authorizes the complete development and implementation of the automated commercial environment (ACE) system for CBP to process imports and exports, and it establishes reporting requirements for program accountability. It also sets new requirements and deadlines for agencies with border responsibility to share information electronically so that all U.S. government import and export requirements are fulfilled through a single window in order to reduce costs and streamline trade." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/11/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4704138?4)\]
