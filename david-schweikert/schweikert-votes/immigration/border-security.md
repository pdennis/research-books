# Border Security

### 2024 Border Security Package

**2024: Schweikert Voted For The 2024 Border Security Package.** In April 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would require the Department of Homeland Security to take a number of actions to limit illegal immigration into the United States, including by resuming construction of the "border wall" along the southwestern border, bolstering Customs and Border Protection, reopening border detention facilities, and limiting asylum applications and eligibility. The bill would not mandate the use of an E-Verify system for employers to confirm workers\' immigration status and eligibility to work in the U.S. It would provide \$9.5 billion in grants to border states for physical barriers and to reimburse law enforcement agencies or the National Guard for immigration enforcement expenses." The vote was on passage. The House rejected the bill by a vote of 215 to 199. \[House Vote 143, [4/20/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll143.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/20/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/143?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 3602](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3602/all-actions)\]

-   **The Package Contained The Provisions Of The Proposed 2023 Immigration Package Minus A Provision Requiring Employers To Use An E-Verify System To Confirm Employee Immigration Status And With Additional Funding For Physical Barriers In Border States.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "But in a new twist, Johnson also said he would move an additional bill, handled under a separate rule, to toughen security measures at the southern U.S. border. He said the bill would contain the 'core components' of HR 2, which passed the House last year over solid Democratic opposition. The new border security bill, which is being offered as a new version of an earlier immigration-related measure (HR 3602), contains most of the HR 2 text minus one key piece: mandating the use of an E-Verify system for employers to confirm workers\' immigration status and eligibility to work in the U.S. That provision ran into objections from some Republicans that it would be overly burdensome to certain industries. Instead, a new section is added to the border bill that would appropriate \$9.5 billion in grants to border states for physical barriers and to reimburse law enforcement agencies or the National Guard for immigration enforcement expenses. That would be paid for by rescinding unused Commerce Department funds intended to offset regular fiscal 2025 appropriations, but with the new border bill unlikely to become law, that 'pay-for' is probably safe." \[Congressional Quarterly, [4/17/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7988225?10)\]

According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill appropriates a total of \$42.4 billion in net discretionary funding for border security (combined Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement funding), \$620 million (1.5%) more than FY 2019 but \$2.0 billion less than requested. An additional \$3.0 billion in spending for those agencies would be available through the collection of various fees. It provides a total of \$14.9 billion for Customs and Border Protection (\$44 million more than FY 2019 but \$3.3 billion less than requested) and a total of \$8.1 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\$492 million, or 6%, more than FY 2019, but \$701 million less than requested) \[...\] The total includes \$4.4 billion for immigration enforcement and removal activities, \$155 million (4%) more than FY 2019. Within that total, \$3.1 billion is for ICE\'s custody operations, \$28 million (1%) less than FY 2019. According to Senate appropriators, that funding would provide for 45,274 detention beds, equal to the FY 2019 level but 8,726 less than the president\'s request." The vote was a motion to concur in the Senate Amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 280-138. The Senate then passed the bill and the President signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 690, [12/17/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll690.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/17/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/690?11); Congressional Actions, [H.R.1158](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1158/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22:%5b%22hr+1158%22%5d%7d&s=1&r=1&KWICView=false)\]

According to Congressional Quarterly, "Combined, the spending measures would provide about \$1.3 trillion in discretionary spending, with \$1.2 trillion subject to discretionary spending caps, and \$78.1 billion designated as Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The measure\'s spending levels are consistent with the increased defense and non-defense budget caps set by the two-year budget deal agreed to last month. That agreement increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80 billion and the non-defense cap by \$63 billion. Given that the previous caps were set to reduce overall discretionary spending by \$5 billion, the net increase provided by the omnibus is \$138 billion over the FY 2017 level." The vote was on the motion to concur in the Senate Amendment with an Amendment. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 256 to 167. The Senate later agreed to the legislation, sending it to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 127, [3/22/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll127.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/22/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5287294?5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1625](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1625/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Increased Funding For CBP And ICE, But Limited Funding On Hiring New ICE Interior Enforcement Personnel.** According to the Washington Post, "The bill bumps up funding for both U.S. Customs and Border Protection and for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement --- delivering increases sought by the Trump administration. But there are significant restrictions on how that new money can be spent. Democrats pushed for, and won, limitations on hiring new ICE interior enforcement agents and on the number of undocumented immigrants the agency can detain. Under provisions written into the bill, ICE can have no more than 40,354 immigrants in detention by the time the fiscal year ends in September. But there is a catch: The Homeland Security secretary is granted discretion to transfer funds from other accounts 'as necessary to ensure the detention of aliens prioritized for removal.'" \[Washington Post, [3/22/18](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2018/03/22/heres-what-congress-is-stuffing-into-its-1-3-trillion-spending-bill/?utm_term=.51975194623a)\]

The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 219 to 213, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 209, [5/11/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll209.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/11/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/209?5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2/all-actions)\]

The Senate then passed the bill and the President signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 690, [12/17/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll690.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/17/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/690?11); Congressional Actions, [H.R.1158](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1158/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22:%5b%22hr+1158%22%5d%7d&s=1&r=1&KWICView=false)\]

-   **The FY 2020 Minibus Provided \$1.375 Billion For A Border Wall, Over \$3 Billion Less Than What Trump Requested.** According to Washington Post, "At the crux of a new deal, the White House will get \$1.375 billion in Homeland Security funds for the wall ― significantly less than the \$5 billion Trump sought ― and no money to backfill the \$3.6 billion in military construction funds the administration moved this year for the project. Democrats, in exchange, abandoned language to lower limits on the amount the military can shift between accounts, from \$9.5 billion to \$1.5 billion." \[Washington Post, [12/19/19](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/12/19/pentagon-finally-gets-its-2020-budget-from-congress/)\]

According to Congressional Quarterly, "Congress provided only \$1.375 Billion for border barriers \[...\] The agreement does not authorize the \$7.2 billion requested by the president for Army OCO military construction funding to build the border wall, half of which (\$3.6 billion) would be to back-fill accounts where funds diverted for wall construction." The vote was on adoption of the conference report to accompany the bill. The House adopted the conference report by a vote of 377-48. The bill was later passed by the Senate and signed into law by the President. \[House Vote 672, [12/11/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll672.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/17/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5790600?4&search=CSh9Mp8f); Congressional Actions, [S.1790](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1790/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22s+1790%22%5D%7d&s=1&r=1)\]

-   **The Senate Bill Allowed Trump To Move \$6 Billion Within Appropriations For The Wall, While The House Bill Only Allowed \$1.5 Billion To Be Moved.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "unlike the House-passed bill, the measure does not block the president's ability to use defense funds in the future \[...\] the agreement provides the Defense Department with 'transfer' authority to move \$6.0 billion within appropriations accounts (including special authority to move \$2.0 billion within the OCO account). The House measure only allowed for \$1.5 billion to be moved." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/17/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5790600?4&search=CSh9Mp8f)\]

-   **Trump Used The Emergency Declaration To Divert \$3.6 Billion Away From 127 Military Construction Projects In Order To Build A Border Wall.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The White House has used the emergency declaration to repurpose \$3.6 billion of Defense Department funds appropriated for 127 military construction projects, diverting the money instead to build a wall along the southern border." \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/27/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5735590?35)\]

**2019: Schweikert Voted For Allowing The Trump Administration To Use Funds From The Treasury Forfeiture Fund To Pay For The Border Wall.** In June 2019, Schweikert voted for an amendment to the FY 2020 minibus appropriations bill, which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "strike from the bill a provision that would prohibit the use of funds from a Treasury Department forfeiture fund to plan or construct a wall, barrier, fence, or road along the U.S. southern border. The fund is sourced from Treasury and Homeland Security Department forfeitures and seizures and used for related law enforcement activities." The vote was on adoption.

-   **Trump Promised To Build A Wall On The Southern Border During The 2016 Campaign And Claimed That Mexico Would Pay For It.** According to the Wall Street Journal, "As a candidate in 2016, Mr. Trump described building the wall as a simple job. He tied it to his identity as a builder, a career that dates to the 1960s when he joined his father's real-estate company. As the author of 'The Art of the Deal,' Mr. Trump put his reputation as a negotiator on the line. \[...\] Yet 'build the wall' chants continue to resound at the president's public appearances. Among Mr. Trump's political base, polls show that 96% support the border wall. More broadly, a majority of Americans oppose such a barrier, the same Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found in January. During the 2016 Republican primary race, Mr. Trump called his build-the-wall campaign promise, 'My best line.' \[...\] The promise to build a wall "and eventually make Mexico pay for it" was written on a dry erase board in Mr. Bannon's West Wing office, competing for attention among other campaign promises. It was one of more than four dozen pledges on the white board, organized by policy area." \[Wall Street Journal, [2/15/19](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-promised-to-build-that-wall-then-ran-out-of-time-and-options-11550262854)\]

-   **December 2018: Trump Demanded Border Wall Funding In Exchange For Keeping The Government Open; The Government Was Then Shutdown For 35 Days.** According to Politico, "The president will make the request in his budget proposal for the upcoming fiscal year, which ends just one month before the 2020 presidential election. The sum --- billions of dollars higher than the \$5.7 billion demand that sparked the 35-day government shutdown --- will surely divide spending negotiators again this year, likely resulting in static funding levels for much of the rest of the government or another lapse." \[Politico, [3/10/19](https://www.politico.com/latest-news-updates/government-shutdown-2019)\]

Trump said he has a 'very powerful alternative' --- an apparent reference to his threats to declare a national emergency in order to fund the border wall --- but said he was 'not going to use it.' Trump thanked Americans and said he's working to ensure that the furloughed workers who missed two paychecks during the shutdown will get backpay." \[CNN, [1/25/19](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/government-shutdown-month-2019/h_23bb25d922b6c9eba1b59b6b94049e7d)\]

Outside of the Homeland bill, it includes another \$1.6 billion for border security, as well as a 1.9% pay increase for federal civilian employees. President Trump, who wanted \$5.7 billion for 234 miles of new border 'wall,' has not yet decided whether he will sign the agreement, according to White House staff." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/14/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5463527?7)\]

Mr. Trump also signed a bipartisan spending bill that will keep the government funded through the fall and allocates \$1.38 billion for 55 miles of border barriers---far less than the \$5.7 billion the president had asked for. Unsatisfied with the amount set aside by lawmakers for barriers, Mr. Trump now plans to also draw roughly \$6.7 billion from military and other sources, without the approval of Congress." \[Wall Street Journal, [2/15/19](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-set-to-declare-national-emergency-at-border-sign-legislation-to-fund-government-11550241799?mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline)\]

He tied it to his identity as a builder, a career that dates to the 1960s when he joined his father's real-estate company. As the author of 'The Art of the Deal,' Mr. Trump put his reputation as a negotiator on the line. \[...\] Yet 'build the wall' chants continue to resound at the president's public appearances. Among Mr. Trump's political base, polls show that 96% support the border wall. More broadly, a majority of Americans oppose such a barrier, the same Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found in January. During the 2016 Republican primary race, Mr. Trump called his build-the-wall campaign promise, 'My best line.' \[...\] The promise to build a wall "and eventually make Mexico pay for it" was written on a dry erase board in Mr. Bannon's West Wing office, competing for attention among other campaign promises. It was one of more than four dozen pledges on the white board, organized by policy area." \[Wall Street Journal, [2/15/19](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-promised-to-build-that-wall-then-ran-out-of-time-and-options-11550262854)\]

The sum --- billions of dollars higher than the \$5.7 billion demand that sparked the 35-day government shutdown --- will surely divide spending negotiators again this year, likely resulting in static funding levels for much of the rest of the government or another lapse." \[Politico, [3/10/19](https://www.politico.com/latest-news-updates/government-shutdown-2019)\]

Trump said he has a 'very powerful alternative' --- an apparent reference to his threats to declare a national emergency in order to fund the border wall --- but said he was 'not going to use it.'

Outside of the Homeland bill, it includes another \$1.6 billion for border security, as well as a 1.9% pay increase for federal civilian employees.

Mr. Trump also signed a bipartisan spending bill that will keep the government funded through the fall and allocates \$1.38 billion for 55 miles of border barriers---far less than the \$5.7 billion the president had asked for. Unsatisfied with the amount set aside by lawmakers for barriers, Mr. Trump now plans to also draw roughly \$6.7 billion from military and other sources, without the approval of Congress." \[Wall Street Journal, [2/15/19](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-set-to-declare-national-emergency-at-border-sign-legislation-to-fund-government-11550241799?mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline)\]

Under the terms of the declaration, the administration would have access to \$3.5 billion from the Pentagon's military construction budget, along with \$2.5 billion from the Pentagon\'s drug interdiction program and \$600 million from the Treasury Department\'s drug forfeiture fund." \[ABC News, [2/18/19](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-wall-money-military-housing-base-repairs/story?id=61109794)\]
