# Immigration Bans

### Religion Bans

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Prohibiting Immigration Bans On The Basis Of Religion.** In April 2021, Schweikert voted against the National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "explicitly prohibit discrimination based on religion with regard to individuals seeking immigrant visas, nonimmigrant visas or other entry into the United States." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 218-208. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 127, [4/21/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll127.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/21/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/127?14); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1333](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1333/actions)\]

Although much of the debate on the measure centered on Trump\'s immigration policies, several Democrats argued that reintroducing the measure now that he\'s no longer in office was evidence that the measure is nonpartisan." \[Congressional Quarterly, [4/14/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/committees-20210414461355?1)\]

-   **Republicans Argued The Bill Would Undermine Executive Powers And Instead Called For Action Against The Migrant Surge On The Southern Border.** According to The Hill, "Republicans warned that the legislation would unnecessarily undermine executive authority and called for action to address the current surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border instead." \[The Hill, [4/21/21](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/549577-house-passes-bill-aimed-at-stopping-future-trump-travel-ban)\]

It would terminate the restriction, absent intervening congressional action, if the briefing or reports are not provided." \[Congressional Quarterly, [4/21/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/127?14)\]

-   **The Bill Would Require The State And Homeland Security Departments To Consult With Congress And Provide Specific Justification For The Immigration Restrictions And Propose A Time Duration Before Issuing The Restriction.** According to The Hill, "The State Department and Department of Homeland Security would have to consult with Congress and provide specific evidence justifying the immigration restriction and its proposed duration before imposing it." \[The Hill, [4/21/21](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/549577-house-passes-bill-aimed-at-stopping-future-trump-travel-ban)\]

-   **The Bill Would Have Required A Report On Former President Trump's Immigration Restrictions.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "require the State and Homeland Security departments to submit a report to Congress describing the implementation of proclamations by former President Donald Trump that restricted the entry of individuals from certain countries, including the number of refugees admitted and the number of visa applicants admitted or rejected, disaggregated by country and visa category."
