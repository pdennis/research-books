# DHS Office Of Civil Rights And Civil Liberties

### Funding

**2013: Schweikert Voted Against Adding Over \$3 Million To The DHS Office Of Civil Rights And Civil Liberties, Taken From U.S. Immigration And Customs Enforcement.** In June 2013, Schweikert voted against an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act (H.R. 2217) that would have increased the budget of DHS' Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties by \$3,346,000. That increase was offset by a \$4 million cut to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Automation Modernization program. The amendment was defeated by a vote of 167 to 257. \[House Vote 194, [6/5/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll194.xml); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 97](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/97/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2217](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2217/all-actions)\]

-   **Amendment Sponsor: Amendment Intended To Keep DHS Civil Rights Office At FY2013 Funding Level.** According to Rep. Moore, the amendment's sponsor, the amendment was "intended to restore the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to fiscal year '13 levels by transferring \$3,346,000 into the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management." Moore later asserted that, without her amendment, "\[H.R. 2217\] would cut the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties by 15.5 percent and then direct the office to pay for this increase of reviews for the 287(g) and Secure Communities programs by making further internal cuts to other essential areas of their mission." \[Congressional Record, [6/5/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/citation.result.CREC.action?congressionalRecord.volume=159&congressionalRecord.pagePrefix=H&congressionalRecord.pageNumber=3132&publication=CREC)\]

-   **287(g) Program Allows State and Local Law Enforcement To Enforce Federal Immigration Law Under An Agreement With ICE.** According to ICE, the program "allows a state and local law enforcement entity to enter into a partnership with ICE, under a joint Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).  The state or local entity receives delegated authority for immigration enforcement within their jurisdictions." "287(g)" refers to the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that authorizes the program. \[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, [12/31/12](http://www.ice.gov/news/library/factsheets/287g.htm); "Delegation of Immigration Authority Section 287(g) Immigration and Nationality Act," ICE Website, [Viewed 11/14/14](http://www.ice.gov/287g/)\]

-   **March 2010 DHS Inspector General Audit Of 287(g) Program Found Problems In ICE Oversight Of Local Partners.** According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, "Immigration and Customs Enforcement is not adequately vetting, training or supervising the police forces that have been empowered to enforce immigration law, according to the March \[2010\] report by the Department of Homeland Security\'s inspector general." \[Atlanta Journal Constitution, 4/26/10\]

-   **Appropriations Committee Chairman: Bill Already Included "Ample" Funding For 287(g) Oversight.** According to House Appropriations Committee Chairman Carter (R-TX), "this amendment is unnecessary since the bill already includes ample funding for necessary oversight of ICE\'s 287(g) program. In fact, on page 11 of the bill\'s accompanying report, it states: 'Included within the amount recommended for the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties is a total of \$2,394,000 for reviews of 287(g) agreements and ICE\'s Secure Communities. These funds are in addition to the ongoing work of ICE\'s Office of Professional Responsibility and the DHS Office of Inspector General, who reviews 287(g) agreements for compliance.' " \[Congressional Record, [6/5/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/citation.result.CREC.action?congressionalRecord.volume=159&congressionalRecord.pagePrefix=H&congressionalRecord.pageNumber=3132&publication=CREC)\]

-   **Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Thanked Chairman For "Fully-Funding" 287(g) Oversight In Bill.** During debate on the Moore amendment, Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Price (D-NC) said, "I want to commend Chairman Carter for fully funding the much-needed oversight activities related to the troubled 287(g) program and to the Secure Communities program. Oversight of these programs is probably the highest priority for this office. But with just a little more funding, as provided in this amendment, we can go further to ensure the protection of civil rights and civil liberties across the Department\'s many functions, programs, and activities." \[Congressional Record, [6/5/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/citation.result.CREC.action?congressionalRecord.volume=159&congressionalRecord.pagePrefix=H&congressionalRecord.pageNumber=3132&publication=CREC)\]

-   **ICE Automation Modernization Program Funds Improvements In ICE Infrastructure.** According to ICE, "The Automation Modernization Program allows ICE to improve information sharing with DHS and other partner organizations. The Automation Modernization Program strengthens information availability, improves detainee tracking and preparation of travel documents, provides a fully secure information technology (IT) environment, and enhances financial management and audit practices." \[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, [11/15/11](http://www.ice.gov/news/library/factsheets/budget-fy2012.htm)\]

-   **Appropriations Committee Chairman: Cuts To ICE Automation Modernization Would Lead To Longer Wait Times At U.S. Ports Of Entry.** According to Appropriations Committee Chairman Carter (R-TX), "the offset to this amendment will cut CBP\'s Automation Modernization account\--a cut that will impede CBP\'s processing of trade and result in longer wait times at our ports of entry, which are detrimental impacts to our economy which none of us can afford to accept." \[Congressional Record, [6/5/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/citation.result.CREC.action?congressionalRecord.volume=159&congressionalRecord.pagePrefix=H&congressionalRecord.pageNumber=3132&publication=CREC)\]
