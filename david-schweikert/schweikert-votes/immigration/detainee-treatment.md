# Treatment Of Detainees

### Hysterectomies

**2020: Schweikert Voted Against Condemning ICE For Referring Detainees For Hysterectomies And Other Unnecessary Invasive Gynecological Procedures.** In October 2020, Schweikert voted against a resolution that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "express that the House of Representatives condemns the performance of unwanted and unnecessary medical procedures on individuals without their full, informed consent \-- particularly with regard to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement\'s Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Ga. It would express that 'everyone deserves to control their own reproductive choices and make informed choices about their bodies' and that further accountability and transparency is necessary to protect people in custody of ICE. The resolution would call on the Homeland Security Department to pause the removal of individuals who experienced any medical procedure at the Irwin County Detention Center; allow individuals who may have experienced an unnecessary or nonconsensual procedure to have immediate access to appropriate medical treatment; comply with investigation and records requests related to the detention center; ensure that impacted individuals are able to participate in investigations; and hold individuals involved accountable." The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 232-157. \[House Vote 217, [10/2/20](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll217.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/2/20](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2020/H/217?6&15%3F8); Congressional Actions, [H.Res 1153](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/1153?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22h+res+1153%22%5D%7d&s=1&r=1)\]

-   **The Resolution Comes After Allegations That Detainees At The Irwin County Detention Center Received Hysterectomies And Other Gynecological Procedures Without Fully Understanding Or Consenting To Them.** According to the New York Times, "The Department of Homeland Security is investigating allegations that immigrant women detained at a privately run detention center in Georgia underwent gynecological procedures without fully understanding or consenting to them. \[...\] The complaint details medical procedures ordered or undertaken by a physician who has treated patients detained at the Irwin County Detention Center, which is run by a private company, LaSalle Corrections, On Ocilla, Ga. The nurse, Dawn Wooten, claims in the complaint that several women detained at the facility told her their uteruses had been removed without their consent." \[New York Times, [9/16/20](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/us/ICE-hysterectomies-whistleblower-georgia.html)\]

-   **Republicans Voted Against The Resolution, Claiming They Were Awaiting The Results Of An Official Investigation.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., argued Democrats must 'take a step back' and await the results of official investigations underway." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/7/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6027338?3)\]
