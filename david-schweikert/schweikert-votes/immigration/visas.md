# Visas

### Diversity Visa Program

**2018: Schweikert Voted Against The So-Called Compromise GOP Immigration Will That Funded The Wall, Provided A Pathway To Citizenship For DACA Recipients, And Ended The Diversity Visa Lottery Program.** In June 2018, Schweikert voted against the "compromise" immigration proposal between Republican conservatives and moderates. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Passage of the bill that would appropriate \$23.4 billion for various border security activities. Included would be \$16.6 billion for a 'border wall system,' which would be available from fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2027, and \$6.8 billion for border security investments, which would be available from fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2023. It would provide those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status a six-year renewable contingent non-immigrant legal status and would allow them to apply for a green card after five years, providing a path to citizenship. It would modify legal immigration by ending the diversity visa program and reallocating those visas to other classifications. The bill would require that undocumented immigrants who are charged with a misdemeanor offense for improper entry into the United States be detained with their minor children." The vote was on passage. The House rejected the bill by a vote of 121 to 301. \[House Vote 297, [6/27/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll297.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/27/18](http://cq.com/vote/2018/H/297?0); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 6136](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6136/all-actions)\]

Acceding to Congressional Quarterly, "Passage of the bill that would authorize \$24.8 billion for fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022 for various border security activities, including \$9.3 billion for a border wall and other physical barriers and would provide individuals registered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program with a three-year, renewable contingent non-immigrant legal status but with no special path to citizenship. It would modify legal immigration by ending the diversity visa program and restricting most family-based immigration to allow only spouses and minor children of legal permanent residents to receive green cards. It would increase enforcement of immigration laws within the United States, including by requiring all employers to verify the immigration status and eligibility of individuals seeking jobs in the United States." The vote was on passage. The House rejected the bill by a vote of 193 to 231. \[House Vote 282, [6/21/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll282.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/21/18](http://cq.com/vote/2018/H/282?0); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4760](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4760/all-actions)\]
