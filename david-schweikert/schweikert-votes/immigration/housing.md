### Prevent Housing Assistance To Undocumented Immigrants

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Prevent Funds From Being Used To Provide Financial Assistance For Housing To Undocumented Immigrants.** In June 2015, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would bar funds from being used to provide non-citizen eligibility for need-based housing. According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have "bar\[red\] funds from being used to provide financial assistance in contravention of section 214 (d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980, regarding non-citizen eligibility for need-based housing." The underlying measure was H.R. 2577, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016. The vote was on the amendment. The House of Representatives adopted the amendment by a vote of 246 to 180. The bill passed the House, but it later was turned into a different appropriations bill. \[House Vote 320, [6/9/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll320.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/9/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/320?0); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Rep. David Price (D-NC): Amendment Restates Existing Law And Was Only Proposed To Feed Into An Anti-Immigration Agenda.** In a floor speech, Rep. Price said, "I rise in opposition to this amendment. Once again, we have an amendment that, on its face, simply restates existing law. In fact, the gentleman offering the amendment has acknowledged that existing law categorically prohibits HUD benefits from going to undocumented persons. What is going on here? What is lurking beneath the surface? I fear something is. An anti-immigrant agenda based on fear and prejudice would appear to be the answer. We are feeding into widely held misconceptions that so many undocumented immigrants are seeking and receiving Federal benefits, that Federal programs, Federal dollars, are being abused and misused." \[Congressional Record, [6/9/15](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/422/text)\]

-   **Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL): Center for Immigration Studies Said That In 2012, At Least 130,000 Non-Citizen Headed Households Live In Public Housing** In a floor speech, Rep. Brooks said, "I ask the House of Representatives to have the courage, to have the backbone, to be financially responsible. The House can do that in part by adopting my amendment that eliminates Federal Government housing subsidies for illegal aliens. How big is this problem? Census Bureau data analyzed by the Center for Immigration Studies in 2012 reflects that at least 130,000 households headed by self-identifying illegal aliens live in public or subsidized housing. That is potentially hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars being illegally taken by illegal aliens with the tacit or open consent or even the encouragement of the United States Government. Think about that for a moment. While American families struggle to make ends meet, while America faces a debilitating and destructive insolvency and bankruptcy, while American families and lawful immigrants are being forced to wait in line for public housing, this administration ignores the law to spend potentially hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars subsidizing illegal aliens, thereby encouraging their illegal conduct." \[Congressional Record, [6/9/15](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/422/text)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Prohibit The Use Of Funds Against Current Law Which Prevents Undocumented Immigrants From Obtaining Housing Assistance.** In June 2015, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would bar funds from being used in violation of HUD regulations relating to restrictions on assistance to non-citizens. According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have "bar\[red\] funds from being used in violation of HUD regulations relating to restrictions on assistance to non-citizens." The underlying measure was H.R. 2577, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016. The vote was on the amendment. The House of Representatives adopted the amendment by a vote of 244 to 181. The bill passed the House, but it later was turned into a different appropriations bill. \[House Vote 319, [6/9/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll319.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/9/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/319?1); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL): "My Amendment Simply Ensures That No Funds Can Be Used To Circumvent Current Law Which Prevents Illegal Immigrants From Obtaining Housing Assistance."** In a floor speech, Rep. Yoho said, "Madam Chair, my amendment simply ensures that no funds can be used to circumvent current law which prevents illegal immigrants from obtaining housing assistance. Spending should be prioritized based on the needs of American taxpaying citizens, not those who are residing in our country illegally. Constituents back in my district and throughout the country work hard every day, and their needs should not play second fiddle to those of immigrants who broke our laws and came into this country illegally. With the continued efforts by some in this country to disregard the rule of law, much to the detriment of taxpaying Americans, I truly believe this amendment is necessary to clarify and reinforce the intent of Congress as it pertains to housing assistance providing via HUD." \[Congressional Record, [6/9/15](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/420/text)\]

-   **Rep. David Price (D-NC): "We Must Not Allow This Appropriations Bill To Become A Platform To Denigrate Immigrants In This Country Or To Score Political Points At Their Expense."** In a floor speech, Rep. Price said, "This amendment feeds into the widely held misperception that many undocumented individuals are, in fact, obtaining Federal benefits despite restrictions\--verification procedures\--specifically designed to prohibit such activity. We must not allow this appropriations bill to become a platform to denigrate immigrants in this country or to score political points at their expense." \[Congressional Record, [6/9/15](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/420/text)\]
