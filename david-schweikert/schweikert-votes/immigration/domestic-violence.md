### The Violence Against Women Act With Provisions Protecting Undocumented Women

**2013: Schweikert Voted Against A Reauthorization Of The Violence Against Women Act That Included Protections For Immigrants, LGBT Populations And Native Americans.** In February 2013, Schweikert voted against the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which, according to Politico, "include\[d\] protections for illegal immigrants, Native Americans and people in same-sex relationships." According to The Washington Post, "First authorized in 1994, the bill provides \$660 million over the next five years for programs that provide legal assistance, transitional housing, counseling and support hotlines to victims of rape and domestic abuse." The House passed the measure, which had already passed the Senate, by a vote of 286 to 138. The president signed the bill into law on March 7, 2013. \[House Vote 55, [2/28/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll055.xml); Politico, [3/7/13](http://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/obama-signs-violence-against-women-act-88582.html); The Washington Post, [3/7/13](http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-07/politics/37533955_1_obama-signs-president-obama-domestic-abuse); Public Law 113-4, [3/7/13](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-113publ4/pdf/PLAW-113publ4.pdf); Congressional Actions, [S. 47](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/47/all-actions)\]

-   **House GOP Permitted Vote On The Senate's VAWA Reauthorization Bill After A Republican Substitute Version Of The Bill Was Rejected; Doing So Allowed Members To Vote For VAWA But Not For The Senate's Version.** According to Politico, "The Violence Against Women Act is finally headed to President Barack Obama's desk for his signature. The House voted Thursday to accept the bipartisan Senate bill, 286-138. Eighty-seven Republicans joined 199 Democrats to support the bill. No Democrats opposed it. After months of delay, GOP leaders allowed the bill to come to the floor only after a Republican substitute version of the legislation --- set up as an amendment to the Senate's bipartisan bill --- failed, 166-257. The House amendment was expected to fail, but allowed members to vote for a version of VAWA while not supporting the Senate bill." \[Politico, [2/28/13](http://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/violence-against-women-act-passes-88238.html)\]

-   **Boehner Broke The "Hastert Rule" By Bringing Senate's Version of VAWA Reauthorization Up For A Vote; 138 House Republicans, A Majority, Voted Against The Measure.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Senate passed the bill Feb. 12, 2013, in a 78-22 vote, with all 22 'no' votes coming from male Republicans. Meanwhile, every female senator voted for the bill. Despite objections from some Republicans about the immigrant and tribal courts provisions, the House passed the Senate version of the legislation on Feb. 28, 2013, by 286-138. All of the 138 'no' votes were from Republicans, meaning that Speaker John A. Boehner, R-Ohio, had to break the so-called 'Hastert rule' by relying on Democratic votes to pass the measure." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/6/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/billwatch-4228376)\]

-   **The Bill Expanded Protections For Immigrant Victims Of Domestic Violence By Expanding The Qualifications For U Visas.** According to Metro Latino USA, "This Tuesday the Senate overwhelmingly passed S. 47, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. The bill expands protections for immigrant women by broadening the qualifications for a U Visa, a visa for immigrant survivors of crimes who assist law enforcement. However, unlike a similar reauthorization bill in 2012, the 2013 version does not increase the number of U Visas available each year." \[Metro Latino USA, 2/13/13\]

-   **The 2013 VAWA Reauthorization Did Not Include The Provision From The 2012 Version That Would Have Expanded The Number Of U Visas For Immigrant Victims Of Domestic Violence.** According to Huffington Post, "This year's Senate VAWA bill is similar to last year's, except that it leaves out a piece that would expand the number of U visas for immigrant victims of violence. Leahy has pledged to attach that piece to immigration reform legislation." \[Huffington Post, [2/12/13](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/12/vawa-vote_n_2669720.html)\]

-   **Human Rights Watch Found That Immigrant Women Were At Higher Risk For Domestic Abuse.** According to CNN, "On undocumented immigrants, Human Rights Watch has found that immigrant farm workers are especially at risk for domestic abuse and argued provisions in the Senate bill 'would go some way toward fixing the problem.'" \[CNN, [2/28/13](http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/28/politics/violence-against-women)\]

-   **Senators Dropped The Provision For Increased Numbers Of U Visas From The 2013 Bill To Lessen Opposition And Because Of A Procedural Requirement That Revenue-Generating Bills Originate In The House.** According to Washington Post, "At issue last year were expanded protections for immigrant, LGBT and Native American victims that Democrats favored. A House version without those new provisions passed but did not get the support of the Senate or White House. While the new bill keeps those protections, it removes a provision that would increase 'U visas,' making legal and work status available to immigrant victims. That change was described as procedural since only the House can originate bills that raise revenue, and it was also seen as a way to remove opposition to the reauthorization." \[Washington Post, [2/5/13](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2013/02/05/how-will-the-violence-against-women-act-fare-in-congress/)\]
