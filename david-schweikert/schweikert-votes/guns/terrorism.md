### Prohibiting Suspected Terrorists From Buying Guns

**2016: Schweikert Effectively Voted To Block A Vote On A Bill That Would Prohibited Those On The FBI's Terrorist No-Fly List From Passing A Background Check.** In July 2016, Schweikert effectively voted to block legislation that, according to a floor speech by Rep. Michael Thompson (D-CA), "says that if you are on the FBI's terrorist no-fly list then you don't get to walk into a gun store, pass a background check, and leave with a gun or guns of your choosing." The vote was on a motion to table an appeal of the ruling of the chair sustaining a point of order against a motion to recommit. The overall motion to recommit would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "report\[ed\] the bill back to the House with an amendment that would replace the measure with the text of a bill related to background checks for firearm purchases and transfers." The House agreed to the motion to table, effectively killing a vote on the motion to recommit by a vote of 240 to 182. \[House Vote 375, [7/6/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll375.xml); Congressional Record, [7/6/16](https://www.congress.gov/crec/2016/07/06/CREC-2016-07-06-pt1-PgH4449.pdf); Congressional Quarterly, [7/6/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/h/375?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4361](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4361/all-actions)\]
