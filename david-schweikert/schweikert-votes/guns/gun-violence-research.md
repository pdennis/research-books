# Gun Violence Research

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2020 Minibus Appropriations Bill, Which Provided \$25 Million for Gun Violence Research.** In December 2019, Schweikert voted against the FY 2020 minibus spending bill According to The Hill, "federal agencies will receive \$25 million from Congress to study gun violence \[...\] The deal includes \$12.5 million each for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Institutes of Health to study gun violence and ways to prevent it." The vote was a motion to concur in the Senate amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 297-120. The Senate later passed the bill and the President signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 689, [12/17/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll689.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/17/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/689?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R.1865](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1865/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+1865%22%5D%7d&s=4&r=1)\]

-   **The FY 2020 Minibus Was The First Time In Over 20 Years That Congress Had Appropriated Money For Gun Violence Research.** According to The Hill, "It's the first time in more than 20 years that Congress has appropriated money for gun violence research \[...\] Congress stopped funding gun violence research in 1996 after an amendment passed blocking agencies from using federal funds to advocate for gun control \[...\] While Democrats had tried for years to end the amendment, they shifted their strategy this year, pushing for \$50 million in funding while leaving the amendment in place in an attempt to allay concerns that the money could be used inappropriately." \[The Hill, [12/16/19](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/474740-25m-set-aside-for-gun-violence-research-in-spending-agreement-in-win-for)\]
