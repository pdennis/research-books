# Bureau Of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms And Explosives

### Funding

**2017: Schweikert Voted For Cutting ATF Funding By \$65 Million.** In September 2017, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "decrease\[d\] funding for the Department of Justice's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives by \$64.7 million, and would \[sic\] and transfer\[ed\] the savings to the department's spending reduction account." The underlying legislation was a legislative vehicle for an FY 2018 Omnibus appropriations bill. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 98 to 313. The House later passed the overall bill. The Senate took no substantive action on the overall legislation. \[House Vote 494, [9/13/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll494.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/13/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/494?0); Congressional Actions, [H.
