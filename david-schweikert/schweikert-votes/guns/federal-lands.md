### Prohibit The Army Secretary From Enforcing Firearm Regulations On Federally Managed Water Infrastructure

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Prohibit The Army Secretary From Barring Individuals From Carrying Firearms At Water Resource Development Projects.** In February 2016, Schweikert voted for a bill which expanded hunting and fishing on federal lands which also prohibited someone from being blocked from carrying a firearm at a water resource development project. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "prohibit\[ed\] the Army secretary from issuing or enforcing regulations that prohibit individuals from carrying firearms at water resources development projects." The underlying bill would have, according to The Hill, "expand\[ed\] public access to recreational shooting and hunting on federal lands." The bill did this by, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[ing\] public lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service to be considered open for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting unless the managing agency closes the land to such activities." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 242 to 161. The Senate took no substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 101, [2/26/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll101.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/26/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/101?18); The Hill, [2/26/16](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/270934-house-passes-sportsmens-bill); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2406](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2406/all-actions)\]
