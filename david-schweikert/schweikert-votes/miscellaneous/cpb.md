# Corporation For Public Broadcasting

### Elimination

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating Funding For The Corporation For Public Broadcasting.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted for a budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555, [10/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll555.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/5/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/555?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating Funding For The Corporation For Public Broadcasting.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Eliminate Funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) A free society should not have government-supported media outlets, especially ones that so often convey political news and opinion. There is no shortage of media outlets and news services available to consumers. Even Sesame Street is now on HBO. Eliminating all taxpayer funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) beginning in FY 2018 would save \$485 million per year." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed 10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Eliminate The Corporation For Public Broadcasting As Part Of The FY 2016 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted for eliminating the CPB. According to the Republican Study Committee, the budget proposed to "Eliminate Funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB)\[.\] A free society should not have government-supported media outlets, especially ones that so often convey political news and opinion. There is no shortage of media outlets and news services. Eliminating all taxpayer funding for the CPB beginning in FY 2016 would save \$445 million per year." The underlying budget resolution would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] for \$2.804 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2016, not including off-budget accounts. The substitute would call for reducing spending by \$7.1 trillion over 10 years compared to the Congressional Budget Office baseline." The vote was on the substitute amendment to a Budget Resolution. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 132 to 294. \[House Vote 138, [3/25/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll138.xml); Republican Study Committee, [FY 2016 Budget](http://rsc.flores.house.gov/files/Initiatives/rsc-budget.pdf); Congressional Quarterly, [3/25/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/138?23); Congress.gov, [H.

**2013: Schweikert Voted To Eliminate Funding For The Corporation For Public Broadcasting.** In March 2013, Schweikert voted to support eliminating funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, as part of the Republican Study Committee's proposed budget resolution covering fiscal years 2014 to 2023. According to the Republican Study Committee, the budget would "Eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting." The vote was on an amendment to the House budget resolution replacing the entire budget with the RSC's proposed budget; the amendment failed by a vote of 104 to 132 with 171 Democrats voting present. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Repeating a strategy from last year, 171 Democrats voted "present" to push Republicans to vote against the RSC plan to make sure it did not have enough support to replace the Ryan plan." \[House Vote 86, [3/21/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll086.xml); Republican Study Committee, [3/18/13](http://rsc.scalise.house.gov/uploadedfiles/back_to_basics-rsc_fy2014_budget.pdf#10); Congressional Quarterly, [3/25/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/weeklyreport-4245452); Congressional Actions, [H.
