# National Endowment For The Arts

### Elimination

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating The National Endowment For The Arts.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted for a budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555, [10/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll555.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/5/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/555?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating The National Endowment For The Arts.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities The federal government should not be in the business of funding the arts. The Constitution is clear about the federal government's proper role 'to promote the progress of Science and useful Arts' as the protection of private property rights: 'securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries'. Support for the arts can easily and more properly be found from non-governmental sources. Eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts would save taxpayers \$148 million per year and eliminating the National Endowment for the Humanities would save an additional \$148 million per year. The president's Budget Blueprint would eliminate these inappropriate agencies." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed 10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]
