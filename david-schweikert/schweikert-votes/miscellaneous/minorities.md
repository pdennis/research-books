### Rep. Steve King (R-IA)

**2019: Schweikert Voted To Express The Sense Of Congress That White Nationalism And White Supremacy Are Hateful Expressions.** In January 2019, Schweikert voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "express the sense of Congress rejecting white nationalism and white supremacy as hateful expressions of intolerance that contradict the values of the House of Representatives." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the resolution. The House adopted the resolution by a vote of 424 to 1. \[House Vote 32, [1/15/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll032.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/15/19](http://cq.com/vote/2019/H/32?17); Congressional Actions, [H. Res. 41](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/41/all-actions)\]

-   **Rep. Steve King (R-IA) Made Additional Racists Comments That Led To Him Being Removed From His Committee Assignments.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "On January 10, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, was quoted in the New York Times as asking, 'White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization --- how did that language become offensive?'' Although King claims his quote was mischaracterized and that he was only referring to his support for Western civilization, his history of making controversial statements on race led Republican leaders on January 14 to strip him of his committee assignments. King called the decision to remove him 'a political decision that ignores the truth.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/14/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5444333?13)\]
