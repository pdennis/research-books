### Corporation For Public Broadcasting

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2020 Minibus Appropriations, Which Increased Funding For The Corporation For Public Broadcasting Despite Trump's Efforts To Eliminate Federal Funding.** In December 2019, Schweikert voted against the FY 2020 minibus spending bill, which represented 8 of the 12 appropriations bills. According to Government Executive, "For the last decade, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has seen its funding kept flat or reduced. That is set to change in fiscal 2020, with lawmakers allocating \$465 million, a \$20 million increase. Trump has repeatedly sought to eliminate federal funding for CPB." The vote was a motion to concur in the Senate amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 297-120. The Senate later passed the bill and the President signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 689, [12/17/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll689.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/17/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/689?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R.1865](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1865/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+1865%22%5D%7d&s=4&r=1)\]
