**2015: Schweikert Voted To Prohibit Any Native American Tribal Nation From Operating A Gambling Establishment In The Phoenix Metropolitan Area Through 2026.** In November 2015, Schweikert voted for prohibiting Native American tribes from operating a bingo or Las-Vegas like gaming in the Phoenix area through January 1, 2027. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have, "prohibit\[ed\] any tribal nation from operating bingo or Las Vegas-style gaming in the Phoenix metropolitan area through Jan. 1, 2027. The measure would \[have\] appl\[ied\] to lands held in trust by the Interior Department after April 9, 2013." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill, requiring a two-thirds majority (273 for this vote). The House rejected the motion by a vote of 263 to 146. \[House Vote 626, [11/16/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll626.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/16/15](http://cq.com/vote/2015/h/626?2); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 308](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/308/all-actions)\]

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Reaffirm That The Lands Which The Interior Department Took Into A Trust For The Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians In Michigan And Would Have Effectively Allowed The Tribe's Casino To Continue To Operate By Prohibiting Lawsuits Related To The Trust Land.** In September 2014, Schweikert voted for a bill that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "reaffirm\[ed\] the status of lands taken into trust by the Interior Department for the benefit of the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians in Michigan and prohibit any lawsuits related to the trust land, which would thereby allow the tribe's casino to continue operating." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 359 to 64. The bill was then sent to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 503, [9/16/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll503.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/16/14](http://cq.com/vote/2014/h/503?38); Congressional Actions, [S. 1603](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1603/all-actions)\]
