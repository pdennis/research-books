# D-Day Prayer

### Requiring That The World War II Memorial Include FDR's Prayer On June 6, 1944

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Inscribe FDR's D-Day Prayer At Washington, D.C.'s World War II Memorial; Federal Funding For The Inscription Would Be Banned.** In June 2014, Schweikert voted for an bill that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] the Interior Department to install a plaque or inscription at the World War II memorial in Washington, D.C. with the words that President Franklin D. Roosevelt prayed with the United States on June 6, 1944, the morning of D-Day. It would \[have\] bar\[red\] the use of federal funds for the plaque or inscription, but it would allow the Interior department to accept and expend private contributions for its installation." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion, passing the bill, by a vote of 370 to 12. The bill was the sent to the president as the Senate had already agreed to the bill. The president signed the bill into law later in June. \[House Vote 339, [6/23/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll339.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/23/14](http://cq.com/vote/2014/H/339?1); Congressional Actions, [S. 1044](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1044/all-actions)\]
