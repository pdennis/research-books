# Republican Study Committee Budget

### FY 2014

**2013: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2014 Republican Study Committee Budget, Which Would Have Capped FY 2014 Discretionary Spending at Below FY2008 Levels.** In March 2013, Schweikert voted for the Republican Study Committee's proposed budget resolution covering fiscal years 2014 to 2023. According to the Republican Study Committee, "In FY 2014, the RSC budget proposes that non-emergency discretionary spending be capped \$950 billion, bringing agency funding to slightly below FY 2008 levels." The vote was on an amendment to the House budget resolution replacing the entire budget with the RSC's proposed budget; the amendment failed by a vote of 104 to 132 with 171 Democrats voting present. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Repeating a strategy from last year, 171 Democrats voted "present" to push Republicans to vote against the RSC plan to make sure it did not have enough support to replace the Ryan plan." \[House Vote 86, [3/21/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll086.xml); Republican Study Committee, [3/18/13](http://rsc.scalise.house.gov/uploadedfiles/back_to_basics-rsc_fy2014_budget.pdf#9); Congressional Quarterly, [3/25/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/weeklyreport-4245452); Congressional Actions, [H.

Res. 25](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/25/all-actions)\]

-   **The Republican Study Committee's Budget Cut Discretionary Authority To \$950 Billion, \$16 Billion Less Than The Ryan Budget.** According to the Republican Study Committee, the budget would "Set discretionary spending at \$950 billion in FY 2014 (rolling spending back below FY2008 levels)." According to Congressional Quarterly, "The \[Ryan\] budget resolution would cap non-emergency discretionary spending for fiscal 2014 at \$966." \[Republican Study Committee, [3/18/13](http://rsc.scalise.house.gov/uploadedfiles/back_to_basics-rsc_fy2014_budget.pdf); Congressional Quarterly, 8/29/13\]

-   **The Budget Capped Discretionary Spending At Current Year Levels Until FY2017.** According to the Republican Study Committee, "Until the budget is balanced in 2017, the RSC budget caps total discretionary spending at current year levels. After the budget is balanced, total discretionary spending is allowed to grow with inflation." \[Republican Study Committee, [3/18/13](http://rsc.scalise.house.gov/uploadedfiles/back_to_basics-rsc_fy2014_budget.pdf)\]

-   **The Budget Increased FY 2014 Budget Authority For Discretionary Defense Spending To Pre-Sequester Levels.** According to the Republican Study Committee, the budget would "Ensure our nation's security by funding defense at the same level as the House Republican budget, growing from \$552 billion in FY2014 to \$678 billion in FY2023." According to Congressional Quarterly, "The \[FY2014 to 2023 budget resolution authored by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan\] would limit defense discretionary spending to \$552 billion in fiscal 2014, essentially wiping out the sequester's effect on the Pentagon and transferring those cuts to the domestic side of the ledger." \[Republican Study Committee, [3/18/13](http://rsc.scalise.house.gov/uploadedfiles/back_to_basics-rsc_fy2014_budget.pdf#18); Congressional Quarterly, [3/25/13](http://www.cq.com/doc/weeklyreport-4245452)\]

-   **The Budget Increased Cut FY 2014 Budget Authority For Discretionary Non-Defense Spending To \$398 Billion In FY2014 And \$392 Billion In FY2023.** According to the Republican Study Committee, the budget would "Reduce non-defense discretionary spending from \$398 billion in 2014 to \$392 billion in 2023." \[Republican Study Committee, [3/18/13](http://rsc.scalise.house.gov/uploadedfiles/back_to_basics-rsc_fy2014_budget.pdf#8)\]

### FY 2015

**2014: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2015 Republican Study Committee Budget, Which Called For Reducing Spending To 18.1 Percent Of GDP, In Part By Freezing Discretionary Spending At Pre-FY 2008 Levels For Four Years.** In April 2014, Schweikert voted for the Republican Study Committee's proposed budget resolution for fiscal years 2015 to 2024. According to the Republican Study Committee, "Our proposal balances in four years, bringing spending down to an average of 18.1 percent of GDP while limiting average revenue to 18.1 percent of GDP, close to the historical average. \[...\] Specifically, this proposal sets the following common-sense policies: \[...\] Freeze discretionary spending at \$950 billion, the pre-2008 spending levels, starting in FY2015 until the federal budget is balanced." The House considered the RSC budget as a substitute amendment to House Republicans' FY 2015 budget resolution; the amendment was rejected by a vote of 133 to 291. \[House Vote 175, [4/10/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll175.xml); Republican Study Committee, [4/7/14](http://rsc.woodall.house.gov/uploadedfiles/the_budget.pdf); Congressional Actions, [H.

Res. 96](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/96/all-actions)\]

### FY 2016

**2015: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2016 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted for the FY 2016 RSS Budget Resolution. According to Congressional Quarterly, the budget would have "balance\[d\] the budget by FY 2021, while limiting revenues and spending to 18.2% of GDP. The substitute reduces spending by \$7.1 trillion over 10 years compared to the CBO baseline. The proposal caps discretionary spending at \$975 billion in FY 2016, freezes it for two years, and then allows it to grow with inflation. It sets discretionary defense spending at \$570 billion (\$47 more than the current baseline), non-defense discretionary spending at \$405 billion (\$88 less than the current baseline) and allows for \$58 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) spending (the House Republican budget allows for \$94 billion in OCO spending). After FY 2019, OCO spending is incorporated into (non-emergency) discretionary defense spending and therefore subject to the cap." The vote was on the substitute amendment to a Budget Resolution. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 132 to 294. \[House Vote 138, [3/25/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll138.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/25/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4648418?29&search=BkF9JoQu); Congressional Quarterly, [3/25/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/138?23); Congress.gov, [H. Amdt. 83](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/83); Congressional Actions, [H. Con.
