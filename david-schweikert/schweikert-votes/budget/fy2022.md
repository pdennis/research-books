That bit of good news for Democrats from the Joint Committee on Taxation, the official scorekeeper for tax legislation, is tempered by the fact that a good chunk of households earning between \$200,000 and \$500,000 would see a tax increase and fall into a category President Joe Biden and Democrats pledged to protect." \[Congressional Quarterly, [8/9/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7548522?8)\]
