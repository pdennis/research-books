### Congressional Black Caucus Substitute

**2014: Schweikert Voted Against The Congressional Black Caucus Substitute To The FY 2015 Budger.** In April 2014, Schweikert voted against , according to Congressional Quarterly, the "substitute amendment that would provide for \$3.443 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2015, not including off-budget accounts. It would call for an additional \$500 billion over the first three years for infrastructure and jobs programs, including \$230 billion for infrastructure repairs; \$100 billion for a national direct job creation program; \$50 billion for school modernization; \$50 billion to fund teacher, law enforcement and first responder jobs; \$50 billion to rebuild neighborhoods; \$13 billion for job training and \$7 billion for summer jobs. It also would call for \$388 billion increase in funding for anti-poverty programs such as the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program and extending unemployment insurance. It also would recommend raising the federal minimum wage from \$7.25 to \$10.10 per hour and assume repeal of the automatic spending cuts under the sequester. To pay for the spending increases, it would recommend a number of revenue increases including lowering tax deductions and eliminating tax breaks for corporations and wealthy Americans and a number of policy changes such as adding a public option to health insurance exchanges, passing comprehensive immigration overhaul and ending spending from the Defense Department\'s Overseas Contingency Operations account." The vote was on the substitute amendment.
