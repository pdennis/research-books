-   **The Package Included FY 2021 Appropriations For Defense, Commerce-Justice-Science, Energy-Water, Financial Services, Labor-HHS-Education, And Transportation-HUD.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The spending package includes the underlying Defense bill, Commerce-Justice Science, Energy-Water, Financial Services, Labor-HHS-Education, and Transportation-HUD bills.

-   **The House Voted On Nearly 340 Amendments, Most Of Them Bundled Together In An "En Bloc" Package That Prevented Lawmakers From Recording Individual Votes.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Lawmakers voted on nearly 340 amendments Thursday in about three hours, mostly bundled together in giant 'en bloc' packages that deprived lawmakers of the opportunity to vote on them individually. A handful of standalone amendments were allowed, however, such as the lone vote held over to Friday: an effort by Rick W. Allen, R-Ga., to cut the \$209.2 billion Labor-HHS-Education division of the package by 5 percent. That amendment was rejected, 123-292. House members voted separately on an amendment by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to block the military from recruiting using e-sports platforms like Twitch, which was defeated." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/31/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5973019?17)\]

-   **Included In The En Bloc Amendments Was A Provision To Effectively End Trump's Transgender Military Ban.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House adopted by voice vote an amendment to the fiscal 2021 Defense appropriations bill Thursday that would effectively bring an end to the Trump administration's severe restrictions on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. military. The amendment was tucked into a massive en bloc package of amendments that were attached to the six-bill spending package that includes defense funding \[...\] the amendment would block the use of funds to implement policy issued in April 2019 that would bar transgender people from joining the military and even keep some transgender people who are already serving from staying in." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/30/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5971667?15)\]

-   **Another Provision In The En Bloc Amendments Prohibited Funds From Being Used Towards The Administration's "Zero-Tolerance Police" In Regards To Persecuting Criminal Immigration Offenses.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Also included in the first en bloc package are a number of other politically contentious amendments \[...\] One such amendment by Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, would prohibit the use of funds provided by the defense bill to implement an April 2018 Justice Department memorandum regarding a 'zero-tolerance policy' in the prosecution of criminal immigration offenses along the southwest U.S. border." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/30/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5971667?15)\]

-   **Democrats Pushed Through Additional Amendments To Block The DOJ From Interfering With State Marijuana Laws And From Gutting The ACA In Court.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "They also voted on an amendment from Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., to block the administration from intervening with state and tribal cannabis legalization efforts, and one from Lauren Underwood, D-Ill., to prevent the White House from trying to gut the 2010 health care law in court. Both amendments were adopted." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/31/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5973019?17)\]

-   **Another Amendment Prohibited Funds To BE Used For Buying Chemical Weapons For Domestic Riot Control.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Another, sponsored by Rep. Alma Adams, D-N.C., would prohibit the bill's funds from being used for the acquisition of chemical weapons for domestic riot control. The language comes after an at times violent response by federal and local enforcement to the nationwide protests that emerged following the police killing of George Floyd." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/30/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5971667?15)\]

-   **Republicans Tried To Cut A \$15 Million Pilot Program Providing Grants To Nonprofit Organizations Helping Asylum Seekers At The Mexico Border.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Before final passage, the House rejected a motion to recommit from Republicans, a procedural maneuver that would have amended the bill, that would have eliminated \$15 million for a pilot program to provide grants to nonprofit organizations providing legal representation for asylum seekers at the Mexico border. Republicans wanted to move that money to the Byrne grants program, which provides funding for local, state and tribal police departments \[...\] the grant program would help reduce the backlog of claims that has led to crowded conditions at immigration detention facilities." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/31/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5973019?17)\]

-   **The White House Issued A Veto Threat For The Six-Bill Package, Citing Issues Ranging From Use Of Military Force Authorizations To Face Mask Requirements.** According to Congressional Quarterly, the White House issued a veto threat and "took issue with everything from repeal of Bush-era authorizations for the use of military force to a mandate that airline, rail, and transit passengers wear face masks \[...\] the vote margin wasn't large enough to override a potential veto by President Donald Trump. The final spending bills will have to be negotiated with the White House and GOP-controlled Senate, most likely after November elections." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/31/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5973019?17)\]

The package includes \$27.5 billion in emergency spending that Republicans and the White House contend busts the budget caps deal reached last summer and contains numerous policy riders they labeled 'poison pills.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/24/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5966059?9)\]

Prevent the administration from shuttering Peace Corps activities in China. Block food stamps restrictions for able-bodied adults with children. Require the National Park Service to take down plaques, statues and other items commemorating the Confederacy, and rename military bases named for Confederate soldiers. Block the White House from shifting funds from military construction projects to President Donald Trump\'s prized border wall project." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/24/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5966059?9)\]

-   **Republicans Attempted To Shift \$102.5 Million From A Fund That Helped Developing Nations Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions Towards A New "Countering Chinese Influence Fund."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The GOP motion to recommit, a procedural move that would have had the same effect as an amendment, would have shifted \$102.5 million from the foreign aid account that funds economic support initiatives to the account that funds anti-poverty and democracy-building activities. Republicans said the intent was to take the money out of \$500 million set aside for 'a dedicated international' fund to help developing nations reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as the United Nations\' Green Climate Fund. Instead, the \$102.5 million would be shifted to a newly established 'Countering Chinese Influence Fund,' which was funded at 'not less than' \$300 million in fiscal 2020 " \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/24/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5966059?9)\]

Democrats argued not implementing stricter soot standards is a disservice to Americans and would disproportionately impact communities of color." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/24/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5966059?9)\]
