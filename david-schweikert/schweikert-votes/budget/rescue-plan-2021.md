# American Rescue Plan Of 2021

### Pay-As-You-Go Cuts

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Preventing Sequestration Cuts By Exempting The Budgetary Effects Of The Coronavirus Relief Reconciliation Package From Pay-As-You-Go Requirements.** In March 2021, Schweikert voted against a bill which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "exempt the budgetary effects of the fiscal 2021 budget reconciliation bill (HR 1319 / PL 117-2) comprising a \$1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package from statutory pay-as-you-go requirements, preventing a number of automatic spending cuts to mandatory programs subject to sequestration." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 246-175, sent to the Senate and President and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 96, [3/19/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll096.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/19/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/96?11); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1868](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1868/actions)\]

-   **H.R. 1868 Would Approximately Waive \$381 Billion In Pay-As-You-Go Cuts Over A Five Year Span.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill (HR 1868) would waive the estimated \$381 billion in so-called pay-as-you-go cuts per year over the next five years, a routine move that both parties typically use for expensive legislative priorities." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/19/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6168713?1)\]
