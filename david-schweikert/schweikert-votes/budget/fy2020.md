-   **The FY 2020 Minibus Provided \$1.375 Billion For A Border Wall, Over \$3 Billion Less Than What Trump Requested.** According to Washington Post, "At the crux of a new deal, the White House will get \$1.375 billion in Homeland Security funds for the wall ― significantly less than the \$5 billion Trump sought ― and no money to backfill the \$3.6 billion in military construction funds the administration moved this year for the project. Democrats, in exchange, abandoned language to lower limits on the amount the military can shift between accounts, from \$9.5 billion to \$1.5 billion." \[Washington Post, [12/19/19](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/12/19/pentagon-finally-gets-its-2020-budget-from-congress/)\]

The Senate later passed the bill and the President signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 689, [12/17/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll689.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/17/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/689?8); Congressional Actions, [H.R.1865](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1865/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+1865%22%5D%7d&s=4&r=1)\]

-   **Politico: Repealing The Cadillac Tax "All But Guts The Funding Provisions" For The ACA.** According to Politico, "Congress preserved a moratorium on the 'Cadillac' tax until 2022 \[...\] The move all but guts the funding provisions for the Affordable Care Act, with the Cadillac tax repeal alone projected to cost nearly \$200 billion." \[Politico, [12/16/19](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/16/congress-repeal-major-health-care-taxes-spending-deal-086138)\]

-   **The FY 2020 Minibus Raised The Age Of Sale For Tobacoo To 21, Which Will Be Implemented Over The Three Years.** According to Reuters, the bill "\[raised\] the U.S. tobacco purchasing age to 21 \[...\] The crackdown on youth smoking, by changing the minimum age for cigarette and other tobacco purchases to 21 from the current 18, would give the U.S. food and Drug Administration six months to develop regulations. The agency would then have three years to work with states on implementing the change." \[Reuters, [12/16/19](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-budget-congress/us-spending-deal-would-raise-tobacco-age-deny-some-trump-border-wall-money-idUSKBN1YK1X8)\]

-   **The Bill Would Serve As A Stopgap Measure To Fund The Government Until The 12 Annual Spending Bills Are Passed.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The temporary funding bill is designed to give appropriators more time to decide how to divvy up \$1.37 trillion in discretionary spending among the 12 annual spending bills needed for the fiscal year that is already more than seven weeks old. That task has been stymied mostly over funding for a wall along the U.S. southern border." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/21/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/btnews-5774320?16&search=KNWJ74jg)\]

-   **The Stopgap Bill Increased Funding For The 2020 Census.** According to Congressional Quarterly, the continuing resolution included "A provision allowing the Census Bureau to spend at a \$7.3 billion annualized rate in order to ensure adequate funding for the 2020 decennial count. That includes \$90 million for special mobile questionnaire assistance centers to replace brick-and-mortar locations, an effort that has run into skepticism from some lawmakers as well as the bureau\'s external advisory board." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/19/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5771448?4)\]

-   **The Stopgap Bill Provided Funding To Extend Numerous Programs Until A Complete Budget Could Be Passed.** According to Congressional Quarterly, the continuing resolution included "Provisions extending numerous expiring health care programs that were temporarily renewed in the most recent stopgap law, such as funding for community health centers and teaching hospitals, as well other miscellaneous programs ranging from the higher education reauthorization law to the Export-Import Bank." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/19/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5771448?4)\]

-   **The Stopgap Bill Ensured A 3.1% Pay Raise For U.S. Troops To Take Effect Jan. 1."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The stopgap bill \[...\] also would specifically ensure a 3.1% pay increase for U.S. troops that's supposed to take effect Jan. 1." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/19/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5772644?5)\]

**2020: Schweikert Voted Against A Continuing Appropriations Bill To Fund The Government Through November 21, 2020.** In September 2019, Schweikert voted against a continuing appropriations bill, which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide funding for federal government operations and services through Nov. 21, 2019, at fiscal 2019 levels."

-   **The Bill Would Give Lawmakers More Time To Agree On FY 2020 Spending Bills.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Senate on Thursday cleared legislation to fund federal agencies through Nov. 21, giving lawmakers and the White House more time to reach agreement on the annual appropriations process." \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/26/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-5734030?40&search=fMpLs4vG)\]

-   **The Stopgap Bill Does Not Address Partisan Fighting Over Immigration And Abortion Policies, Including Funding For The Border Wall.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "the short-term funding, which Trump is expected to sign, does nothing to resolve the partisan fights over funding levels, immigration and abortion policies that have stalled spending bills for months. And the increasingly bitter deadlock over funding for a wall along the southern border still threatens to blow up the appropriations process, as it did last year. \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/27/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-5734115?15)\]

-   **The Bill Was Delayed Several Days To Do Disagreements Over Payouts For Farmers Affected By Presidennt Trump's Trade War With China.** Last-minute disagreements on the temporary spending bill largely related to certain agriculture related payouts for tariff-affected farmers and ranchers had delayed work on the bill for several days. But lawmakers ultimately agreed on billions of dollars more to support agricultural losses that were incurred as a result of President Donald Trump's trade war with China and other countries. \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/19/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5728186?17)\]

The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 224-196.

-   **The Bill Blocked The Implementation Of The SEC's Regulation Best Interest, Which Customer Advocates Have Rebuked.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure included amendments offered by House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., regarding Securities and Exchange Commission policies. One Waters' amendment would keep the SEC from implementing its new Regulation Best Interest, which sets a code of conduct for investment advisers' and broker-dealers' communications with customers. Consumer advocates have decried Reg BI, saying it does more harm than good by setting a behavior standard based on disclosing conflicts of interests to clients rather than forcing advisers to act in the clients' best interests, as fiduciaries." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/26/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5581320?41)\]

**2020: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2020 Minibus Spending Bill That Represented 4 Of The 12 Appropriations Bills, Which, Amongst Other Provisions, Blocked A Question On Citizenship In The 2020 Census.** In June 2019, Schweikert voted against the FY 2020 minibus appropriations bill, which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide \$321.9 billion in discretionary spending for five of the 12 fiscal 2020 appropriations bills, including \$73.9 billion for the Commerce and Justice departments and science and related agencies, \$24.3 billion for the Agriculture Department and related agencies, \$39.5 billion for the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and related agencies, \$108.4 billion for the Veterans Affairs Department, military construction, and related agencies, and \$75.8 billion for the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development departments and related agencies.

-   **Democrats Blocked A Republican Amendment In The FY 2020 Minibus That Would Have Thwarted The Implementation Of The Clean Power Plan.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "the House rejected a Republican amendment that would have prohibited the EPA from enforcing the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, which aimed to cut carbon emissions. But the EPA last week finalized a more lenient replacement, which they\'ve dubbed the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which sets no limits on power plant emissions and seeks to prop up the struggling coal industry." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/25/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5579315?1)\]

-   **The FY 2020 Minibus Included Amendments To Provide Additional Funding For Preventing Homelessness.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House adopted three amendments that would boost funds to prevent homelessness \[...\] one \[...\] would move \$1 million from the HUD executive office budget to pay for transitional housing.

-   **The FY 2020 Blocked Pentagon Funding For A Wall On The Southern Border.** According to Defense News, "the White House has threatened that President Donald Trump would veto the massive bill.

That deal, which provided an extra \$324 billion over two years, means that policymakers will have erased nearly all of the additional automatic cuts to agency budgets that took effect in early 2013, according to a CQ Roll Call analysis." \[Congressional Quarterly, [8/5/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/btnews-5614630?7)\]

-   **The Budget Bill Could Add \$1.7 Trillion To The Deficit In The Next Decade.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The new budget deal could add another \$1.7 trillion to deficits in the coming decade, since lawmakers are unlikely to return to lower spending limits, according to an estimate from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an independent watchdog. That projection comes despite a warning from the Congressional Budget Office that the U.S. was already headed for record debt, which "poses substantial risks for the nation and presents policymakers with significant challenges\[...\]in what amounts to a silver lining, the CQ Roll Call analysis also found that deficits are much lower since 2011 than the law had projected at the time, despite the lifting of spending caps. The law was projected to cut \$2.1 trillion from deficits over 10 years." \[Congressional Quarterly, [8/5/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/btnews-5614630?7)\]

-   **The Bill Increased The Defense Cap For FY 2020 By \$90 Billion.** According to CSIS, "The deal increases the defense cap for FY 2020 by approximately \$90 billion above the previous cap of \$576 billion and raises the FY 2021 budget cap of \$590 billion by approximately \$81 billion. BBA 2019 also specifies the funding levels for the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account for FY 2020 and FY 2021. The original purpose of OCO was to fund the incremental costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan; however, due to its exemption from the budget caps under the BCA, the account has been used as a loophole to supplement funding for normal base budget defense activities and, to a lesser extent, nondefense State Department activities. The bill provides \$71.5 billion in OCO for FY 2020 and \$69 billion for FY 2021, bringing total national defense discretionary spending (050) to \$738 billion and \$740.5 billion, respectively." \[CSIS, [8/5/19](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-does-bipartisan-budget-act-2019-mean-defense)\]

-   **The Bill's Republican Proponents Pointed To The Increase In Defense Spending.** According to Politico, "The bill's proponents on the Republican side have been touting the increase in defense spending as worth the compromise with Democrats over domestic spending." \[Politico, [8/1/19](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/01/budget-deal-senate-vote-1444084)\]
