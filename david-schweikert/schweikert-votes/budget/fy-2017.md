According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "provide\[d\] funding for federal government operations through April 28, 2017, at an annualized discretionary rate of \$1.07 trillion. The measure also would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$170 million in response to the lead-contaminated drinking water system in Flint, Mich., including \$100 million in capitalization grants for EPA's Drinking Water State Revolving Fund that the city could use to repair its drinking water infrastructure. It also would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$872 million for medical research and anti-opioid addiction grants and would \[have\] transfer\[ed\] a net \$45 million to support extending health benefits for retired coal miners for four months. It would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$10.1 billion in additional Overseas Contingency Operations funds for the Defense Department and certain other security-related accounts.

According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "provide\[d\] \$1.16 trillion in discretionary appropriations through Sept. 30, 2017 for federal departments and agencies covered by the remaining 11 fiscal 2017 spending bills. \[...\] The measure would also \[have\] provide\[d\] \$608 million for health benefits for retired coal miners, \$296 million for Medicaid payments to Puerto Rico, and \$341 million to replace 40 miles of existing fencing along the southwestern border, though the designs of the fencing must have been 'previously deployed'." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendments. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 309 to 118. The Senate later also agreed to the legislation, sending the bill to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 249, [5/3/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll249.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/4/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/S/121?0); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 244](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/244/all-actions)\]

-   **Funding For The Federal Government Would Have Expired On May 5.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "With the April 28 expiration of government funding approaching, Congress late last week enacted a one-week extension of the CR through Friday, May 5, to give negotiators time to work out remaining issues and for Congress to consider the omnibus measure." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/2/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5094280?4)\]

-   **The Legislation Did Not Include '160 Poison Pill Riders.'** According to Roll Call, "Appearing with Schumer on Monday afternoon, Leahy said the way Democrats 'were able to knock out 160 poison pill riders --- 160 --- in \[the GOP's\] proposal demonstrates that, at least among the grown-ups in both parties, in both bodies, they wanted to get down to doing it the way we are supposed to.'" \[Roll Call, [5/2/17](http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/democrats-take-omnibus-victory-lap)\]

-   **Legislation Did Not Include A Dollar For Dollar Increase In Defense And Non-Defense Spending.** According to The Hill, "Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is touting this week's budget deal for breaking the rule that Democrats enforced under President Obama: Every dollar in increased defense spending had to be matched by a dollar increase for nondefense discretionary programs. 'Under the Obama rules, if you wanted to help the military, if you wanted a pay raise for the soldiers, if you wanted to buy new airplanes and new ships and more munitions, a dollar for that, you had to have a dollar domestic spending. We just broke that parity,' Ryan said at a press conference Tuesday morning. 'That's the biggest victory we could have had --- \$25 billion year over year for our military, to begin to rebuild our military, without that kind of corresponding increase in domestic discretionary spending. That, to me, is very important,' he added." \[The Hill, [5/2/17](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/331540-ryan-touts-spending-deal-for-breaking-obama-rules-for-defense)\]

### September Continuing Resolution

**2016: Schweikert Voted Against A Continuing Resolution Funding The Government Through December 9, 2016, But Without Aid For Flint, Michigan.** In September 2016, Schweikert voted against a ten week continuing resolution. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation was a "continuing resolution \[...\] that keeps the government running through Dec. 9." In addition, according to Congressional Quarterly, "Democrats and Republicans appear to be locked in a staring contest over the lack of government assistance for Flint, Mich., in a stopgap spending bill, with aides on both sides suggesting they're waiting for the other side to blink. Democrats roundly criticized a GOP written continuing resolution filed Thursday by Senate Republicans, but the measure actually met many of the spending and policy demands Democrats had made throughout weeks of negotiations --- except for a Flint response. Their central objection to the stopgap is the inclusion of flood relief for Louisiana and likely other states without also providing aid for Flint to address major problems caused by lead contamination in the city water supply." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment. The House agreed to the motion, effectively passing the bill by a vote of 342 to 85. The Senate had already passed the legislation. The president then signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 573, [9/28/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll573.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/23/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4963616?21); Congressional Quarterly, [9/26/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4963653?26); Congressional Quarterly, [9/22/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4962089?22); Congressional Actions, [S. Amdt. 5082](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/senate-amendment/5082/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5325](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5325/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Was Originally Blocked, Primarily By Senate Democrats Due, To Flint Aid Omission; Deal With Minority Leader Pelosi And Speaker Ryan Over Flint Aid In A Water Bill Sealed The CR's Passage.** According to the Washington Post, "The Senate cemented an agreement Wednesday to avoid an Oct. 1 government shutdown after House Republicans allowed a vote on federal aid to address the water crisis in Flint, Mich., removing a major obstacle in negotiations. \[...\] Democrats made clear earlier this week they would not support the spending bill unless Republicans moved to guarantee Flint aid, while GOP leaders countered the Senate had approved Flint aid earlier this month in a separate water projects bill. The impasse was broken late Tuesday after House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) struck a deal allowing a vote to attach \$170 million in Flint relief to the House version of the water bill. That bill is expected to pass late Wednesday; the stopgap spending measure is expected to pass shortly afterward." \[Washington Post, [9/28/16](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/09/28/house-leaders-reach-deal-on-flint-aid-potentially-averting-shutdown/)\]
