### Executive Order Inflation Estimates

**2023: Schweikert Voted To Require The Biden Administration To Report On The Estimated Inflationary Impact Of Any Executive Order Projected To Have An Annual Gross Budgetary Or Economic Effect Of At Least \$1 Million.** In March 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Reduce Exacerbated Inflation Negatively Impacting the Nation Act, which would "require the White House, acting through the Office of Management and Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers, to prepare and consider a statement on the estimated inflationary impact of any executive order projected to have an annual gross budgetary or economic effect of at least \$1 million. The bill would direct each executive agency to provide assistance and information as needed in preparing inflation statements. It would require the OMB and CEA, within 180 days of enactment and annually thereafter, to submit a report to Congress containing each inflation statement prepared during the year. The bill\'s requirements would not apply to executive orders that provide emergency relief at the request of a state or local government or that are necessary for national security or implementing international treaty obligations." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 272 to 148, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 131, [3/1/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll131.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/1/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/131?34); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 347](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/347/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Was Designed To Critique Biden Administration Policies That Republicans Claim Have Spurred Inflation And Required The Administration To Evaluate Inflationary Impact Of Major Executive Orders.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House passed a Republican-drafted messaging bill Wednesday designed to express concern about Biden administration policies that backers said have spurred inflation, with support from both sides of the aisle. The bill (HR 347), sponsored by Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York, would require the administration to assess the inflationary impact of major executive orders. No Democrats co-sponsored the measure, but it ultimately passed on a 272-148 vote with 59 Democrats crossing the aisle to support the bill." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/1/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7674749?37)\]

-   **The Bill Would Require An Evaluation On Whether Executive Orders Who Have Significant Impacts On Inflation Or Quantifiable Impact On The Consumer Price Index.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The legislation would direct the Office of Management and Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers to assess whether those orders would have 'no significant impact' on inflation or a 'quantifiable impact on the consumer price index' or a 'significant impact' of which the extent can't be immediately determined." \[Congressional Quarterly, [3/1/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7674749?37)\]
