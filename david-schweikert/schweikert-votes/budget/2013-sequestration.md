# 2013 Sequestration

### FY 2014 Paul Ryan Budget

**2013: Schweikert Voted For Sparing Defense Department From Sequester-Imposed FY 2014 Cuts, Offset By Further, Equal Cuts In Non-Defense Discretionary Spending As Part Of The FY 2014 Ryan Budget.** In March 2013, Schweikert voted for transferring the cost of sequester cuts to the military to other discretionary spending, as part of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's (R-WI) proposed budget resolution covering fiscal years 2014 to 2023. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The resolution would limit defense discretionary spending to \$552 billion in fiscal 2014, essentially wiping out the sequester's effect on the Pentagon and transferring those cuts to the domestic side of the ledger." The resolution passed the House by a vote of 221 to 207, but died in the Senate. \[House Vote 88, [3/21/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll088.xml); Congressional Quarterly, 8/29/13; Congressional Actions, [H. Con. Res. 25](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/25/all-actions)\]
