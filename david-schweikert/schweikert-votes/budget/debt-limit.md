# Debt Limit

### Increase

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Increasing The Federal Debt Limit By \$2.5 Trillion.** In December 2021, Schweikert voted against the resolution which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "increase the statutory limit on federal debt by \$2.5 trillion." The vote was on passage. The House passed the joint resolution by a vote of 221-209, sent to the President, and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 449, [12/15/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll449.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/15/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/449?16); Congressional Actions, [S.J.Res. 33](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/33/actions)\]

-   **According To Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Congress Will Not Have To Raise The Debt Limit Again Until 2023.** According to CBS News, "The resolution introduced in the Senate on Tuesday to raise the debt limit by \$2.5 trillion passed along party lines, 50 to 49. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer said this would mean Congress won't have to fight about raising the debt limit again until 2023 --- beyond the midterm elections." \[CBS News, [12/15/21](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/debt-ceiling-limit-raise-senate-house-december-2021/)\]

-   **The House Voted To Raise The Debt Limit Close To The Deadline Before The U.S. Government Would Not Be Able To Pay Its Bills And Cause An Economic Catastrophe.** According to CBS News, "The vote to raise the debt ceiling comes just one day before the U.S. could stop being able to pay its bills. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she was confident the Treasury could pay the bills through December 15, but there are scenarios where the government would not be able to pay some bills after that point. If the government were to default, she has said it would be catastrophic for the economy and would 'eviscerate' the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic." \[CBS News, [12/15/21](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/debt-ceiling-limit-raise-senate-house-december-2021/)\]

-   **Congress Expedited The Joint Resolution Through A "Temporary One-Time Process" That Allowed The Limit Increase By A Specific Amount And With A Simple Majority.** According to CNN, "Congress passed legislation last week to create a fast-track process to allow Democrats to raise the debt limit in the Senate without help from Republicans. \[...\] The newly created and temporary one-time process that lawmakers approved allowed Senate Democrats to take up and pass a bill to increase the debt limit by a specific dollar amount and a simple majority vote." \[CNN, [12/15/21](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/14/politics/senate-votes-debt-limit-congress-deadline/index.html)\]

-   **The Limit Increase Would Be Sufficient To Ensure Congress Does Not Need To Raise It Again Until After The 2022 Elections.** According to CNN, "It had been expected that Democrats would raise the limit by an amount sufficient to ensure that the issue will not need to be addressed again until after the 2022 midterm elections." \[CNN, [12/15/21](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/14/politics/senate-votes-debt-limit-congress-deadline/index.html)\]

-   **Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen Warned That An Economic Recession Would Be Triggered If The U.S. Would Not Be Able To Pay Its Debts And Bills.** According to CNBC, "Yellen estimated the U.S. would run out of ways to pay its debt on Dec. 15. If Congress does not raise the debt ceiling before the Treasury misses a payment, the country would default for the first time. The Treasury secretary said she expects the U.S. would slip into a recession if Washington failed to make its debt payments." \[CNBC, [12/14/21](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/debt-ceiling-democrats-to-vote-to-avoid-default-on-us-debt.html)\]

-   **Increasing The Debt Limit Would Not Authorize New Spending, But It Would Increase The Borrowing Limit And Permit The Treasury Department To Pay The U.S.'s Bills.** According to CNBC, "Raising the debt limit does not authorize new government spending. Instead, it's akin to an increase in a consumer's credit card borrowing limit and allows the Treasury Department to continue to pay off the nation's bills." \[CNBC, [12/14/21](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/debt-ceiling-democrats-to-vote-to-avoid-default-on-us-debt.html)\]

-   **Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen Noted That Congress Would Have Had To Increase Or Suspend The Debt Limit Even If No Legislation Would Have Passed In 2021.** According to CNBC, "Yellen often notes that Republicans and Democrats would have had to raise or suspend the debt limit even if Congress had passed zero legislation in 2021." \[CNBC, [12/14/21](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/debt-ceiling-democrats-to-vote-to-avoid-default-on-us-debt.html)\]

-   **Republicans Opposed Helping Democrats Address The Debt Limit Because Of The Reconciliation Process Democrats Used For Legislation In 2021, Including The \$1.75 Trillion Social Safety Net And Climate Package.** According to CNBC, "Democrats and Republicans typically vote together to raise or suspend the debt ceiling. This time, however, the GOP has contended Democrats should increase the borrowing limit on their own as they try to pass a \$1.75 trillion social safety net and climate package despite Republican opposition." \[CNBC, [12/14/21](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/debt-ceiling-democrats-to-vote-to-avoid-default-on-us-debt.html)\]

-   **The One-Time Exception To Expedite The Debt Limit Increase Allowed Democrats To Pass The Resolution On Their Own, And Republicans Wanted To Withhold Their Support So They Could Hold The Vote Against Democrats In The Midterm Elections.** According to Vox, "it enabled Democrats to approve the debt limit resolution on their own, with no Republican support. Republicans wanted to withhold their votes in hopes of weaponizing Democrats' vote to raise the debt ceiling in future campaigns." \[Vox, [12/14/21](https://www.vox.com/2021/12/14/22834318/debt-ceiling-vote-filibuster)\]

-   **The One-Time Exception Process To Expedite The Debt Limit Increase Raised Questions On Whether Democrats Would Consider Using The Process For Top Priority Legislation That Republicans Vehemently Oppose, Like Voting Rights, Police Reform And Raising The Minimum Wage.** According to Vox, "The debt ceiling vote has opened the door to questions of whether Democrats would consider filibuster exceptions for other bills, like voting rights protections. Activists, and some Democratic lawmakers, have called for this in recent months amid failures to advance voting rights protections, police reform, and a \$15 minimum wage due to GOP opposition in the Senate. But a filibuster exemption for policy changes is likely to be difficult to secure." \[Vox, [12/14/21](https://www.vox.com/2021/12/14/22834318/debt-ceiling-vote-filibuster)\]

-   **The Joint Resolution Increased The Debt Limit To Almost \$31 Trillion.** According to Politico, "The House passed a measure late Tuesday night to raise the debt limit to nearly \$31 trillion, sending the legislation to President Joe Biden in time to prevent an economically devastating default." \[Politico, [12/14/21](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/14/democrats-raise-debt-ceiling-524204)\]

-   **Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Blamed Democrats For Raising The Debt Limit And Said It Would "Just Be The Beginning" If They Continue To Pass Spending Packages.** According to Politico, "'Washington Democrats' printing, borrowing and spending addiction is directly hurting American families,' McConnell said on the floor Tuesday. 'If they jam through another reckless taxing-and-spending spree, this massive debt increase will just be the beginning.' The Kentucky Republican pinned responsibility for raising the country's borrowing limit on his counterparts across the aisle." \[Politico, [12/14/21](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/14/democrats-raise-debt-ceiling-524204)\]

**2021: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Increasing The Debt Limit.** In December 2021, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the "adoption of the rule (H Res 852) that would provide for House floor consideration of the resolution to increase the debt limit (S J Res 33). The rule would provide for up to one hour of debate on the bill." The vote was on the adoption of the rule. The House adopted the rule by a vote of 220-212. \[House Vote 446, [12/14/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll446.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/14/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/446?4); Congressional Actions, [S.J.Res. 33](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/33/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 852](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/852/actions)\]

**2021: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Increasing The Debt Limit.** In December 2021, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the "motion to order the previous question (thus ending debate and possibility of amendment) on the rule (H Res 852) that would provide for House floor consideration of the resolution to increase the debt limit (S J Res 33). The rule would provide for up to one hour of debate on the bill." The vote was on a motion to order the previous question. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 220-212. \[House Vote 445, [12/14/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll445.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/14/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/445?3); Congressional Actions, [S.J.Res. 33](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/33/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 852](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/852/actions)\]

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Advancing Senate Consideration Of A Joint Resolution That Would Increase The Debt Limit.** In December 2021, Schweikert voted against the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "establish procedures to expedite Senate consideration of a joint resolution to increase the debt limit by a specific dollar amount. Specifically, it would provide for a non-debatable motion to proceed to the joint resolution and, if the motion is agreed to, up to 10 hours of debate on the measure with no amendments or other motions in order, immediately followed by a vote on passage. Such procedures would be valid for consideration of one joint resolution by Jan. 16, 2022." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 222-212, sent to the Senate and President, and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 404, [12/7/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll404.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/7/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/404?2); Congressional Actions, [S. 610](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/610/actions)\]

-   **Legislators Paired The Bill With A "One-Time Change In The Senate Rules" To Permit A Debt Limit Increase Without Needing Republican Votes To Overcome A Filibuster.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "It's an age-old Washington trick for must-pass legislation that requires bipartisan support: Pair the thing the minority hates with something they support and hope they feel the good outweighs the bad. In this week's case the pairing (S 610) was a one-time change in the Senate rules that would allow Democrats to increase the debt ceiling without needing GOP votes to overcome a filibuster and provisions to stave off scheduled cuts to Medicare providers, lab services and physician reimbursements." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/10/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6414191?1)\]

-   **Republicans Who Opposed The Bill Did Not Want To Be Perceived As "Facilitating A Debt Limit Increase" After They Pledged To Not Raise The Limit When Democrats Could Have Used The Budget Reconciliation Process.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Republicans who voted against the bill did not want to be seen as facilitating a debt limit increase, especially after they vowed not to help Democrats raise the borrowing limit since the majority could do it on their own through the budget reconciliation process." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/10/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6414191?1)\]

-   **By Expediting The Consideration Of The Debt Limit Increase, The Senate Would Be Effectively Ending Weeks Of Debate On How To Raise The Debt Limit.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Passage of the fast-track process legislation (S 610) effectively ends weeks of partisan brinkmanship over how to raise the statutory debt limit. Without congressional relief, the government may be unable to meet all its financial obligations after Dec. 15, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen has warned." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/10/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-6412596?1)\]

-   **According To Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, The Government Would Be Unable To Pay For Its Expenses After December 15, 2021 Without Congressional Action.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Without congressional relief, the government may be unable to meet all its financial obligations after Dec. 15, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen has warned." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/10/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-6412596?1)\]

-   **Republican Leadership Considered The Expedited Debt Limit Increase A Victory Because It Would Lead To Democrats Raising The Ceiling On Their Own, In Which They Would Need To Raise The Limit By A Certain Amount Instead Of Suspending It For A Period Of Time.** According to The Hill, "GOP leadership views the deal as a win because it sets up a vote where Democrats will raise the debt ceiling on their own, includes a fast-track process and requires that Democrats raise the debt limit to a specific number rather than suspending it to a date." \[The Hill, [12/9/21](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/585122-gop-senators-help-advance-mcconnell-debt-deal)\]

-   **Republicans Will Not Need To Vote On The Actual Debt Limit Increase, But Democrats Would Still Be Able To Attribute The Passage To Bipartisanship And Without Risking The Fate Of The Debt Limit To A GOP Filibuster.** According to The Washington Post, "Both sides consequently embraced the new arrangement as a political victory. Republicans won't have to vote again on an actual, numerical increase to the debt ceiling, and Democrats can say they did so after some measure of bipartisanship and without risk of GOP obstruction. The fast-track procedure guarantees a vote on the increase set at a simple majority, with no opportunity for a filibuster." \[The Washington Post, [12/9/21](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/12/09/senate-debt-ceiling-vote/)\]

**2021: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Expediting Senate Consideration Of Increasing The Debt Limit.** In December 2021, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the "adoption of the rule (H Res 838) that would provide for floor consideration of a legislative vehicle for the fiscal 2022 defense authorization bill (S 1605), a legislative vehicle for a bill (S 610) to prevent sequestration cuts to Medicare and expedite Senate consideration of a debt limit increase \[...\] The rule would provide for up to one hour of general debate on each bill." The vote was on the adoption of the rule. The House adopted the rule of 219-213. \[House Vote 403, [12/7/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll403.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/7/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/403?6); Congressional Actions, [S. 610](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/610); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 838](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/838/actions)\]

**2021: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Raising The Debt Limit By \$480 Billion.** In October 2021, according to Congressional Quarterly, when considering the adoption of a resolution, Schweikert effectively voted against the "automatic agreement to a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the bill (S 1301) that would increase the statutory limit on federal debt by \$480 billion." The vote was on the adoption of a resolution and a motion to concur. The House adopted the resolution, thus concurring with the Senate, by a vote of 219-206, and sent S. 1301 to the President and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 315, [10/12/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll315.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/12/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/315?33); Congressional Actions, [S. 1301](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1301/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 716](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/716/actions)\]

-   **By Increasing The Debt Limit \$480 Billion, The Government Would Be Able To Pay All Its Bills Through December 3, 2021, But Without A Debt Limit Increase, The Treasury Could Run Out Of Money.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The vote to increase the statutory debt limit by \$480 billion would allow the government to pay all its bills through Dec. 3, lawmakers have said. Without any action by Congress, the Treasury would run out of enough cash to meet its obligations beginning Monday, Secretary Janet L. Yellen has warned." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/12/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-6363205?6)\]

-   **The Passage Of The Increase Only Spared A Couple Days Before The October 18, 2021 Deadline, In Which No Action Would Have Left The National Government Unable To Pay For Social Security Benefits, To Provide Tax Support To Families With Kids, Or To Offer Support To Troops And Veterans.** According to The Washington Post, "Once adopted, it would head off a financial crisis with only days to spare ahead of the original Oct. 18 deadline. Failing to raise the debt ceiling by that date would have left the U.S. government unable to fulfill its financial obligations --- including paying Social Security benefits to seniors, providing tax aid to families with children, or offering pay and other assistance to troops and veterans." \[The Washington Post, [10/7/21](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/10/07/senate-deal-debt-ceiling/)\]

-   **By Increasing The Debt Ceiling Temporarily, Congress Would Be Undergoing Another Deadline To Increase The Debt Limit By December 3, On Which Funding Would Expire For Key Federal Agencies And Programs.** According to The Washington Post, "But the short-term deal also threatens to defer a bigger, more vicious battle between Democrats and Republicans until the final days of the year. The debt-ceiling increase covers federal borrowing only until about Dec. 3, the same day that funding for key federal agencies and programs is set to expire. That means Congress faces yet another deadline to stave off default and prevent a government shutdown, two urgent tasks that carry significant political and economic consequences in the case of failure." \[The Washington Post, [10/7/21](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/10/07/senate-deal-debt-ceiling/)\]

-   **McConnell And Republicans Continued To Push For Democrats To Address The Debt Limit Through The Debt Reconciliation Process Since They Are Using The Process For Their Build Back Better Plan, Which Would Include Initiatives For Climate Change, Paid Family Leave, And Education.** According to Roll Call, "McConnell remains adamant that Democrats must address the debt limit through the budget reconciliation process they are using to advance much of their domestic agenda, including climate change, paid family leave and education initiatives." \[Roll Call, [10/7/21](https://www.rollcall.com/2021/10/07/short-term-debt-limit-vote-teed-up-for-thursday-night/)\]

-   **By Adopting A Rule For Floor Consideration That Automatically Adopted The Debt Limit Increase, The House Sent The Legislation To President Biden's Desk, Which Would Increase The Treasury's Borrowing Limit To \$28.9 Trillion.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "On a strictly party-line vote of 219-206, House Democrats adopted a rule for floor debate (H Res 716) on unrelated legislation that \"deemed\" the Senate-passed debt limit bill (S 1301) as having cleared that chamber. That maneuver sent the bill, which would increase the Treasury Department's borrowing authority by \$480 billion to nearly \$28.9 trillion, to President Joe Biden for his signature, which is expected this week." \[Congressional Quarterly, [10/13/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-6363328?59)\]

-   **The Bipartisan Package Coupled The Debt Limit Relief With Discretionary Spending Caps.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "On a bipartisan 314-117 vote, the House endorsed legislation negotiated by Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and President Joe Biden that would couple debt limit relief with caps on discretionary spending that Republicans said would serve as a down payment on deficit reduction efforts." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7757767?2)\]

-   **Far-Right Republicans Opposed The Package Because It Included A Fraction Of The Deficit Reduction Proposed By The GOP Debt Limit Package.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Hard-line conservatives opposed the bill because it contains just a fraction of the deficit reduction that would have been required under the earlier House GOP debt limit bill." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7757767?2)\]

-   **Left-Leaning Democrats Opposed The Package Due To Work Requirement Expansions For Welfare Programs And Changes To The Permitting Process For Federal Projects.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Left-leaning House Democrats opposed the bill over its expansion of work requirements for welfare programs and modifications made to the environmental review process for federal projects, among other complaints." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7757767?2)\]

-   **The Package Suspended The Limit Past The November 2024 Elections Until January 1, 2025.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill would suspend the debt limit until Jan. 1, 2025, pushing it past the November 2024 elections." \[Congressional Quarterly, [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7757767?2)\]

The vote was on the adoption of the rule.

-   **The Congressional Budget Office Projected That Without Suspending the Debt Limit The Treasury Department Will Likely Run Out Of Money In Attempt To Stay Under The Debt Ceiling By Late October Or Early November.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday the Treasury Department would likely exhaust its available cash and other maneuvers to remain under the statutory debt ceiling by the end of October or early November.

-   **Senate Republicans Have Insisted That Democrats Use The Reconciliation Process To Suspend the Debt Limit Without GOP Support, But Some Democrats Worry There Would Not Be Enough Time Before The Treasury Department Runs Out Of Money And May Be Limited To Raising The Debt Limit To A Certain Amount Instead Of Suspending It To A Later Date.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Senate Republicans have been insisting that Democrats use the filibuster-proof reconciliation process to raise the borrowing ceiling without Republican help, since Democrats are trying to pass trillions of dollars in additional spending that Republicans oppose using the same partisan process \[...\] Some Democrats including McGovern said there isn\'t enough time to raise the debt limit through reconciliation before the Treasury is estimated to run out of borrowing room around Oct. 18. They also cited parliamentary obstacles related to the rules of the Senate but have not been specific about what they are. Another problem for Democrats in using reconciliation is that they might be limited to raising the debt limit to a certain dollar amount through reconciliation, rather than being able to suspend it until a later date as has been the practice since 2013." \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/29/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6353680?15)\]

If Treasury prioritizes payments to bondholders, as has been discussed in past debt limit episodes, that means all other government obligations are at risk --- from Social Security checks to veterans benefits." \[Congressional Quarterly, [9/29/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6353680?15)\]
