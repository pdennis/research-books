# Trade Promotion Authority

### Grant The President Trade Promotion Authority

**2015: Schweikert Voted To Grant President Obama 'Fast-Track' Authority For Trade Bills Submitted To Congress, Including Trans-Pacific Partnership And The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.** In June 2015, Schweikert voted for granting the president 'fast track' authority for trade bills. The legislation would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "grant\[ed\] Trade Promotion Authority, under which implementing legislation for trade agreements negotiated by the administration would be considered by Congress under expedited procedures and could not be amended." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill with an amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 218 to 208. The bill then went to the Senate, which passed the legislation, which was then later signed by the president. \[House Vote 374, [6/18/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll374.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/18/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/374?5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2146](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2146/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Authorized Trade Promotion Authority, Which Governed Congressional Rules For Future Passage Of Trade Bills Where The Bills Are Considered Under An Expedited Process And Cannot Be Amended.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure authorizes special 'trade promotion authority' (TPA, formerly known as 'fast track' procedures) for congressional consideration of legislation to implement U.S. trade agreements, under which such agreements are considered under an expedited process and are subject to simple up-or-down votes so they cannot be amended." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/17/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4708343/2?11&search=yEVaJa1B)\]

-   **Trade Agreements Would Receive Expedited Authority For Those Entered Before July 1, 2018; Authority Could Be Expended Through July 1, 2021.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Under the measure, this expedited authority would apply to U.S. trade agreements that are entered into before July 1, 2018 --- although this authority could be extended by the president to cover trade agreements entered into before July 1, 2021 (unless Congress passes a resolution disapproving such an extension)." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/17/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4708343/2?11&search=yEVaJa1B)\]

-   **Legislation Also Laid Out Trade Negotiating Objectives.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill lays out nearly 150 general and specific negotiating objectives for the administration to pursue in any trade agreement, including rules for intellectual property rights, agricultural trade, labor standards, environmental protections, protections for U.S. investment and human rights." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/17/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4708343/2?11&search=yEVaJa1B)\]

-   **Fast Track' Legislation Creates A New Office Within The United States Trade Representative Office Called The Chief Transparency Officer.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill creates a Chief Transparency Officer within the office of the United States Trade Representative with responsibility for consulting with Congress regarding transparency policy, coordinating transparency in trade negotiations, engaging and assisting the public, and advising on transparency policy." \[Congressional Quarterly, [6/17/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4708343/2?11&search=yEVaJa1B)\]

-   **Presidents Have Had Fast Trade Power For Decades; Had Expired.** According to NPR, "With TPA, the president has the ability to complete trade deals and put them on a so-called 'fast track' through Congress. That means lawmakers can vote only yes or no on a trade agreement, using a simple majority vote with no amendments. Presidents have had this power for decades, but the authority had expired. Obama wanted it renewed so that he can complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal involving the U.S. and 11 other Pacific Rim nations." \[NPR, [6/24/15](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/24/417199659/senate-passes-fast-track-trade-legislation-60-38)\]

-   **'Fast Track' Trade Votes Had "Stumbled Twice Before."** According to The Hill, "Fast-track stumbled twice before its final approval, and the struggles to move it through the House and Senate likely made the victory on Wednesday even sweeter." \[The Hill, [6/24/15](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/246035-senate-approves-fast-track-sending-trade-bill-to-white-house)\]

-   **U.S. Trade Representative: TPA Supports US Job Growth Via Export Or Products Abroad.** According to the U.S. Trade Representative, "TPA Supports U.S. Job Growth. Every \$1 billion in exports of U.S. goods and services supports more than 5,000 U.S. jobs. In 2012, exports of U.S. goods and services supported an estimated 9.8 million American jobs, including 25 percent of all manufacturing jobs. \[...\] TPA Helps Export More 'Made In America' Products Abroad. We know that exports support American jobs. And we know that U.S. trade agreements sustain those job-supporting exports: our agreements with just 20 partners support 46 percent of our country's goods exports overall. In fact, exports accounted for a third of U.S. growth since 2009." \[U.S. Trade Representative, [Accessed 8/19/15](https://ustr.gov/trade-topics/trade-promotion-authority)\]

-   **President Obama And House And Senate Republicans Were In Favor 'Fast Track' Authority.** According to MSNBC, "Support for granting the president 'fast track' authority created an unlikely alliance between the White House, Senate Republicans and even some Hollywood executives eager to strengthen copyright protections." \[MSNBC, [6/24/15](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/senate-approves-fast-track-trade-authority-win-obama)\]

-   **Labor Unions And Liberal Democrats Opposed To 'Fast Track' Authority.** According to The Hill, "Labor unions and liberal Democrats had fought hard against the authority and are likely to now turn their attention toward stopping the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade deal Obama is negotiating with 11 other Pacific Rim nations. \[The Hill, [6/24/15](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/246035-senate-approves-fast-track-sending-trade-bill-to-white-house.)\]

-   **Trans-Pacific Partnership Involves Twelve Nations, Would Reduce Tariffs And Would Represent 40 Percent Of World Trade.** According to the BBC, "The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is one of the most ambitious free trade agreements ever attempted. \[...\] There are 12 countries involved: the US, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Peru. The pact is aimed at deepening economic ties between these nations, slashing tariffs and fostering trade to boost growth. Member countries are also hoping to foster a closer relationship on economic policies and regulation. An agreement could create a new single market like that in Europe. \[...\] The 12 countries have a collective population of about 800 million - almost double that of the European Union's single market. The 12-nation would-be bloc is already responsible for 40% of world trade." \[BBC, [4/29/15](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32498715)\]

-   **Critics Of The Trans-Pacific Partnership Argue That It Is To Keep China At Bay, Would Intensify Labor Competition Between Labor Forces And That It Is Being Negotiated In Secret.** According to the BBC, "What do critics say? They argue it is a not-so-secret gambit to keep China at bay. Others claim it will pave the way for companies to sue governments that change policy on, say, health and education to favour state-provided services. The TPP would also intensify competition between countries' labour forces. But the biggest criticism has been of what the campaigners allege to be secretive negotiations in which governments are seeking to bring in sweeping changes that voters have no knowledge of. Defenders say the reason the negotiations have not been made public is because there is no formal agreement on them as yet." \[BBC, [4/29/15](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32498715)\]

-   **Congressional Support For 'Fast Track' Assists Administrations Efforts For The Transatlantic Trade And Investment Partnership.** According to the New York Times, "With congressional support for 'fast track' authority, the president can press for final agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a legacy-defining accord linking 40 percent of the world's economy --- from Canada and Chile to Japan and Australia --- in a web of rules governing Pacific commerce. His administration can also bear down on a second agreement with Europe --- known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership --- knowing that lawmakers will be able to vote for or against those agreements but will not be able to amend or filibuster them." \[New York Times, [6/23/15](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/24/us/politics/senate-vote-on-trade-bill.html)\]

-   **The Transatlantic Trade And Investment Partnership Aims To Boost The Economies Of The European Union And The United States By Removing Or Reducing Barriers To Trade And Foreign Investment; Bigger Gains Would Come From Regulatory Cooperation.** According to the BBC, "The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or it will be if the negotiations are completed. The aim is to boost the economies of the EU and the US by removing or reducing barriers to trade and foreign investment. \[...\] How would TTIP work? By eliminating almost all tariffs (taxes applied only to imported goods) on trade between the US and the EU. But the tariffs imposed by the US and EU are already relatively low for the most part, although there are some exceptions in, for example, farm produce and textiles. The bigger gains envisaged would come from reducing what are called non-tariff barriers. In particular the two sides think they can promote trade through what they call regulatory co-operation. This is about costs to business. Complying with regulations involves a cost. A firm that wants to export may incur further costs meeting the regulatory requirements of the country it\'s selling into." \[BBC, [5/13/15](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32691589)\]

-   **"Many Democrats Fear That A Pacific Rim Trade Deal Will Cost Jobs For U.S. Factory Workers."** According to NPR, "Many Democrats fear that a Pacific Rim trade deal will cost jobs for U.S. factory workers. They tried to stop TPA and hope to ultimately derail TPP. Some Republicans objected to enhancing Obama\'s authority to deal with foreign countries." \[NPR, [6/24/15](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/24/417199659/senate-passes-fast-track-trade-legislation-60-38)\]

-   **AFL-CIO: "It Is Becoming Clear That The \[Trans-Pacific Partnership\] Will Not Create Jobs, Protect The Environment And Ensure Safe Imports.** According to the AFL-CIO, "The AFL-CIO provided the Obama administration with ideas to improve U.S. trade positions so that they work for the 99%, not just the 1%. Unfortunately, it is becoming clear the TPP will not create jobs, protect the environment and ensure safe imports. Rather, it appears modeled after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a free trade agreement where the largest global corporations benefit and working families are left behind." \[AFL-CIO, [Accessed 8/24/15](http://www.aflcio.org/Issues/Trade/Trans-Pacific-Partnership-Free-Trade-Agreement-TPP)\]

**2015: Schweikert Effectively Voted For Granting President Obama 'Fast-Track' Authority For Trade Bills Submitted To Congress, Including Trans-Pacific Partnership And The Transatlantic Trade And Investment Partnership.** In June 2015, Schweikert voted for a resolution setting a House rule that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "ma\[d\]e in order a motion to concur in the Senate amendment, with an amendment, to the bill (HR 2146) that would \[have\] grant\[ed\] Trade Promotion Authority, under which implementing legislation for trade agreements negotiated by the administration would be considered by congress under expedited procedures and could not be amended." The vote was on the resolution. The House agreed to the resolution by a vote of 244 to 181. The House later agreed to the amendment, thereby passing the bill. The bill then went to the Senate, which passed the legislation, which was then later signed by the president. \[House Vote 373, [6/18/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll373.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/18/15](http://cq.com/vote/2015/H/373?0); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2146](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2146/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H. Res. 321](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-resolution/321/all-actions)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted For A Motion To Concur On The Senate Amendment That Provided Trade Promotion Authority For Trade Agreements Negotiated By The Administration.** In June 2015, Schweikert voted for a motion to concur on the Senate amendments that provided trade promotion authority for trade agreements negotiated by the Administration and entered into before July 2018. According to Congressional Quarterly, the motion was to concur "in the Senate amendment to the bill that would provide Trade Promotion Authority for trade agreements negotiated by the administration, under which they would be considered by Congress under expedited procedures without amendment, and would extend Trade Adjustment Assistance programs to help displaced U.S. workers. The portion of the Senate amendment covered by the division would authorize special 'trade promotion authority' for congressional consideration of legislation to implement U.S. trade agreements, under which such agreements would be considered in Congress under an expedited process and would be subject to simple up-or-down votes so they could not be amended. The expedited authority would apply to trade agreements entered into before July 1, 2018, although the bill would allow for extensions." The vote was on concurring in portion of Senate Amendment preceding Title II and the House agreed to the motion 219 to 211. The underlying bill was HR 1314, the Trade Act of 2015. HR 1314 passed the House on 4/13/15 by a voice vote. The bill passed the Senate on 5/22/15 by a 62 to 37 vote. The legislation later became law, but as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015; H.R. 2146 later became law and granted the president 'fast track' authority. \[House Vote 362, [6/12/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll362.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/12/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/h/362?4); Congress.gov, [H.R. 2146](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2146); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1314](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1314/actions)\]

-   **'Fast Track' Authority Lasts Until 2018, But Can Be Extended Until 2021.** According to The Hill, "Fast-track, or trade promotion authority, will allow the White House to send trade deals to Congress for up-or-down votes. The Senate will not be able to filibuster them, and lawmakers will not have the power to amend them. The expedited process, which lasts until 2018 and can be extended until 2021." \[The Hill, [6/24/15](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/246035-senate-approves-fast-track-sending-trade-bill-to-white-house)\]

-   **'Fast Track' Legislation Includes Parameters For Trade Deals To Follow That Are More Comprehensive Than In Prior 'Fast Track.'** According to Lexology, "The legislation mandates overall trade negotiating objectives, enumerates principal trade negotiating objectives, and outlines trade capacity building priorities. Among the former are market access and economic growth, labor and environmental standards, improved transparency, human rights, and consumer interests. Specific objectives include: liberalization of trade in goods and services; market access for US agricultural exports; fair treatment for domestic investment; protection for intellectual property rights, including on the Internet; protection for digital trade and cross-border data flows; improved regulatory practices and compatibility, and reduction on non-tariff trade barriers; eliminate trade distortions by state-owned enterprises; dismantle localization barriers to trade; implementation of core labor standards and environmental laws; deter currency manipulation; deter corruption; promote domestic trade remedies; and revise global standards reopening regarding border adjustable taxes. These objectives are more comprehensive than those included in prior fast track authorizing language, and have been updated to address new trade issues." \[Lexology, [6/24/15](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=7c9407f3-b470-4519-9cfb-ee34ac66db9a)\]

-   **Trade Adjustment Assistance Was A Program That Helped Workers Who Lose Their Jobs Due To Foreign Trade.** According to the Department of Labor, "The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) Program is a federal program that provides a path for employment growth and opportunity through aid to US workers who have lost their jobs as a result of foreign trade. The TAA program seeks to provide these trade-affected workers with opportunities to obtain the skills, resources, and support they need to become reemployed." \[Department of Labor, [Viewed 10/22/15](http://www.doleta.gov/tradeact/factsheet.cfm)\]

**2015: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against 'Fast Track' Trade Promotion Authority By Voting Against Trade Adjustment Assistance.** In June 2015, Schweikert voted against reauthorizing trade adjustment assistance through June 2021. According to Congressional Quarterly, the vote would have, "reauthorize\[d\], through June 30, 2021, trade adjustment assistance programs and alternative trade adjustment assistance for workers laid off because of the impact of foreign competition. Offsets would \[have\] include\[d\] an extension of certain customs fees and prevention of certain taxpayers with high levels of foreign income from receiving the refundable portion of the child tax credit." The underlying legislation was on a bill that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] Trade Promotion Authority for trade agreements negotiated by the administration, under which they would be considered by Congress under expedited procedures without amendment, and would \[have\] extend\[ed\] Trade Adjustment Assistance programs to help displaced U.S. workers." The vote was division II on a motion to concur with the Senate amendment. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 126 to 302. \[House Vote 361, [6/12/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll361.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [6/12/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/H/361?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1314](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1314/all-actions)\]

-   **In Order To Send Overall Trade Bill To President Obama, Who Lobbied Personally For The Bill, Portion Of The Bill Was Required To Pass.** According to Bloomberg, "Democrats handed President Barack Obama an embarrassing defeat on his trade agenda, blocking final passage of fast-track negotiating authority just hours after he made a rare visit to Capitol Hill to seek their support. In a 126-302 vote Friday, Democrats helped reject a displaced workers' aid program they usually support that was needed to proceed to a final vote on fast-track authority. The House then quickly voted for the fast-track measure, 219-211, though it won't go to Obama's desk unless the worker aid bill also passes. The House plans to vote again on the aid measure Tuesday. Passage would send the trade package to Obama." \[Bloomberg, [6/12/15](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-12/obama-s-fast-track-trade-bill-vote-scuttled-by-house-democrats)\]

Obama is seeking to complete a 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership." \[Bloomberg, [6/12/15](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-12/obama-s-fast-track-trade-bill-vote-scuttled-by-house-democrats)\]
