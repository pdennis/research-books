Hatcher III, Congress has named an Oxnard federal building in his honor. President Joe Biden signed a bill Tuesday designating the U.S. Postal Service facility at 1961 N. C St. as the John R. Hatcher III Post Office Building. U.S. Rep. Julia Brownley, D-Westlake Village, introduced the bill last year to honor Hatcher, who led the Ventura County NAACP for nearly four decades and rose to national prominence within the organization." \[Ventura County Star, [12/29/22](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2022/12/29/oxnard-post-office-renamed-for-john-hatcher-local-civil-rights-leader/69764720007/)\]

He also helped establish the Ventura County African-American Chamber of Commerce and the Tri-County Sentry newspaper." \[Ventura County Star, [12/29/22](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2022/12/29/oxnard-post-office-renamed-for-john-hatcher-local-civil-rights-leader/69764720007/)\]

### Lynn C. Woolsey Post Office Building

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Naming A Postal Office In Petaluma, California After Former Congresswoman Lynn C. Woolsey.** In May 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against a bill that would "designate the postal facility located at 120 4th Street in Petaluma, Calif., as the 'Lynn C. Woolsey Post Office Building.'" The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 230-190, thus the bill was sent to the President. \[House Vote 212, [5/18/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll212.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/18/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/212?15); Congressional Actions, [S. 2938](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2938/actions)\]

**2022: Schweikert Voted To Name A Postal Office In Petaluma, California After Former Congresswoman Lynn C. Woolsey.** In February 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for a bill that would "designate the postal facility located at 120 4th Street in Petaluma, Calif., as the 'Lynn C. Woolsey Post Office Building.'" The vote was on passage. The House lacked a 2/3 majority and rejected the bill by a vote of 245-167. \[House Vote 45, [2/9/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll045.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/9/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/45?6); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2842](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2842/actions)\]

-   **Republicans Prevented The Passage Of A Bill That Would Name A Californian Post Office After Former Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey, Who Served In The House From 1993 To 2013 And Co-Chaired The Congressional Progressive Caucus.** According to The Hill, "The House on Wednesday failed to pass a bill that would name a California post office after one of its own former members after most Republicans prevented it from advancing under a fast-track process. The bill's failure is yet another example of the ever more partisan environment in the House, given that bills to name post offices typically pass handily, either by voice vote or nearly unanimously. The legislation would rename a post office in Petaluma, Calif., after former Rep. Lynn Woolsey (D-Calif.), who served in the House for two decades from 1993 to 2013 and was a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus." \[The Hill, [2/9/22](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/593543-house-fails-to-pass-bill-naming-post-office-after-former-progressive-rep/)\]

-   **Congressman Matt Rosendale (R) Led Efforts To Oppose The Bill By Citing Woolsey's Vote Against Certifying The 2004 President Election Results In Ohio And Her Use Of Congressional Stationery To Seek A Lenient Sentence For A Convicted Rapist Who Was The Son Of One Of Her Employees.** According to The Hill, "Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) spearheaded the GOP opposition to the bill after taking objection to two particular events in Woolsey's record. The first was that Woolsey was one of 31 Democrats who voted against certifying the 2004 presidential election results in Ohio, which former President George W. Bush won by 118,457 votes. A recount of Ohio's election results found that Bush won the state by about 300 fewer votes than initially recorded. Republicans have pointed to Democrats' past objections to GOP presidential victories as justification for their own challenges to states that President Biden won in 2020 leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by a mob of former President Trump's supporters. The second was that Woolsey sought a lenient sentence --- using congressional stationery --- for a convicted rapist who was the son of one of her staffers. Woolsey later apologized for 'making a horrible situation worse.'" \[The Hill, [2/9/22](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/593543-house-fails-to-pass-bill-naming-post-office-after-former-progressive-rep/)\]

-   **Congressman Jared Huffman (D) Praised Woolsey As A "One-Of-A-Kind, Barrier-Breaking Trailblazer And A Lifelong Aviate For Women And Working Families."** According to The Hill, "Huffman called his predecessor a 'one-of-a-kind, barrier-breaking trailblazer and a lifelong advocate for women and working families' during his House floor remarks. He cited Woolsey's background as a single mother who turned to public assistance to support her three children and her advocacy in opposition to the Iraq War. 'Her work in Congress was all about fighting for children and families, and nothing made her prouder than her own children and family,' Huffman said." \[The Hill, [2/9/22](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/593543-house-fails-to-pass-bill-naming-post-office-after-former-progressive-rep/)\]
