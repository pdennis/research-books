### Wandering Individuals Alerts

**2016: Schweikert Voted For Reauthorizing The Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert Program And Expanding It To Include Children With Developmental Disabilities.** In December 2016, Schweikert voted for legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "reauthorize\[d\] the Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert Program and would expand the program to include certain children with developmental disabilities. The measure would also provide grants to state and local agencies and non-profit organizations to provide training related to preventing individuals from wandering and to implement alert systems and locative tracking technology programs to find individuals who have wandered. The measure would authorize the appropriation of \$2 million annually for fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2021." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill by a vote of 346 to 66. The bill died in the Senate. \[House Vote 619, [12/8/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll619.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/8/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/619?0); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4919](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4919/all-actions)\]
