# Higher Education Tax Credits

### American Opportunity Tax Credit

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The House GOP's 2017 Tax Reform Plan Which Significantly Cut Taxes For The Rich And Corporations And Consolidated Various Education Tax Credits.** In November 2017, Schweikert voted for reconciliation legislation which significantly altered the federal tax code. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill substantially restructures the U.S. tax code to simplify the code and reduce taxes on individuals, corporations and small businesses. For individuals, it consolidates the current seven tax brackets down to four and eliminates or restricts many tax credits and deductions, including by eliminating the deduction for state and local income taxes and limiting the deduction for property taxes to \$10,000 and the interest deduction for a home mortgage to the first \$500,000 worth of a loan. \[...\] On the business side, it reduces the corporate tax from 35% to 20% and establishes a 'territorial' tax system that would exempt most income derived overseas from U.S. corporate taxation. It allows businesses to immediately expense 100% of the cost of assets acquired and placed into service, and for small businesses it raises the Section 179 expensing limit to \$5 million for five years. It also establishes a 25% rate for a portion of pass-through business income that would otherwise have to be paid at the ordinary individual tax level, and for small businesses where an individual would receive less than \$150,000 in pass-through income it taxes the first \$75,000 of that income at a 9% rate." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 227 to 205. President Trump later signed an amended version of the bill into law. \[House Vote 637, [11/16/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll637.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/15/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5217156?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Modified Numerous Education Tax Credits By Folding Them All Into A Reformed American Opportunity Tax Credit.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "It consolidates certain education tax credits, folding the Hope Scholarship Credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit into the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), which would be modified to be available for a fifth year of post-secondary education at half the rate as the first four years, with up to \$500 of the credit being refundable. The AOTC would continue to provide a 100% tax credit for the first \$2,000 of certain higher education expenses, such as tuition, fees, and course materials, and a 25% tax credit for the next \$2,000 of such expenses." \[Congressional Quarterly, [11/15/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5217156?4)\]

**2015: Schweikert Voted For Extending Permanently The American Opportunity Tax Credit And The Expanded Child Tax Credit And The Earned Income Tax Credit As Part Of A Larger Tax Extender Passage.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted to extend permanently three individual income-tax provisions that were expanded in the 2009 stimulus. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "made permanent \[...\] the \[...\] expanded versions of the child tax credit, Earned Income Tax Credit and American Opportunity Tax Credit." The underlying measure would "retroactively \[renew\] for the current 2015 tax year most of the expired provisions and further extends them for varying periods, including by making more than a dozen permanent and extending most others for two years (2015 and 2016)." The vote was on concurring in the Senate amendment to the bill with an amendment. The House passed the amendment by a vote of 318 to 109. The legislation was later combined with an Omnibus appropriations bill. The Senate passed the larger measure and the president signed it. \[House Vote 703, [12/17/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll703.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/16/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4808184?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2029](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029/all-actions)\]

-   **The American Opportunity Tax Credit Up To \$2,500 For Tuition And Related Expenses.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure makes permanent a provision from the stimulus law that created a credit for 100% of the first \$2,000 in qualifying tuition and related expenses and 25% for the second \$2,000 in such expenses, for a maximum credit of \$2,500. As much as 40% of the credit is refundable. \[...\] This provision is estimated to cost \$79.9 billion over 10 years, \$43.7 billion of which would be spending outlays." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/16/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4808184?7)\]
