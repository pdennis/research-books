# Active Financing Exemption

**2015: Schweikert Voted For Extending Permanently The Active Financing Exemption As Part Of A Larger Tax Extender Passage.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted to extend permanently the active financing exemption. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "The measure makes permanent the ability of financial services companies and manufacturers with financing arms to defer taxes on income earned overseas from active financing operations. The exemption for this type of foreign income is credited with keeping U.S. manufacturing, financial services and insurance companies competitive with their foreign counterparts. JCT estimates that this provision would cost \$78 billion over 10 years." The underlying measure would "retroactively \[renew\] for the current 2015 tax year most of the expired provisions and further extends them for varying periods, including by making more than a dozen permanent and extending most others for two years (2015 and 2016)." The vote was on concurring in the Senate amendment to the bill with an amendment. The House passed the amendment by a vote of 318 to 109. The legislation was later combined with an Omnibus appropriations bill. The Senate passed the larger measure and the president signed it. \[House Vote 703, [12/17/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll703.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/16/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4808184?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2029](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029/all-actions)\]
