**2015: Schweikert Voted For Modifying Real Estate Investment Funds, Including Doubling The Maximum Stock Ownership Exempted From The Foreign Investment In Real Property Tax Act As Part Of A Larger Tax Extender Passage.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted for modifying real estate investment funds. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation "include\[d\] a range of provisions addressing real estate investment trusts (REITs), including doubling the maximum stock ownership exempted from the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act and restrictions on tax-free spinoffs involving REITs. JCT estimates that these REIT provisions would cost a net \$1 billion over 10 years." The underlying measure would "retroactively \[renew\] for the current 2015 tax year most of the expired provisions and further extends them for varying periods, including by making more than a dozen permanent and extending most others for two years (2015 and 2016)." The vote was on concurring in the Senate amendment to the bill with an amendment. The House passed the amendment by a vote of 318 to 109. The legislation was later combined with an Omnibus appropriations bill. The Senate passed the larger measure and the president signed it. \[House Vote 703, [12/17/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll703.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/16/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4808184?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2029](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029/all-actions)\]
