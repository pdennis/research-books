# Tax Brackets

### Consolidation

**2014: Schweikert Voted To Consolidate The Seven Individual Income Tax Brackets Into Two.** In April 2014, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the "concurrent resolution that would provide for \$2.842 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2015, not including off-budget accounts. \[...\] It would assume the enactment of legislation to consolidate the current seven individual tax brackets into two, allowing for the reduction of the top individual rate from 39.6 percent to 25 percent and the corporate rate from 35 percent to 25 percent and call for repeal of the alternative minimum tax." The House adopted the budget resolution by a vote of 219 to 205, but the Senate did not. \[House Vote 177, [4/10/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll177.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/10/14](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2014/H/177?13); Congressional Actions, [H.
