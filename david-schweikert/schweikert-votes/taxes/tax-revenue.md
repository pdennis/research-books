# Tax Revenue

### Increase

**2014: Schweikert Voted Against The Congressional Progressive Caucus Substitute To The FY 2015 Budget, Which Increased Tax Revenue.** In April 2014, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the "Grijalva, D-Ariz., substitute amendment that would provide for \$3.248 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2015, not including off-budget accounts. \[...\] It would call for changes to the tax code to generate additional revenue, including the addition of five higher marginal tax rates for individual incomes in the tax code, capping the value of itemized deductions, repealing the step-up for capital gains at death and the elimination of the home deduction credit for vacation homes and yachts." The substitute was rejected by a vote of 89 to 327. \[House Vote 173, [4/9/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll173.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/9/14](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2014/H/173?12); Congressional Actions, [H.Con.Res. 96](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-resolution/544/all-actions)\]

**2013: Schweikert Voted Against The Congressional Progressive Caucus Substitute To The FY 2014 Budget, Which Would Increase Taxes On High-Income Individuals And Corporations.** In March 2013, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the "Grijalva, D-Ariz., substitute amendment that would provide \$3.802 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2014, not including off-budget accounts. The plan would assume repeal of the automatic spending cuts under the sequester. It would assume \$2.1 trillion in new spending through fiscal 2015 through enactment of several job-related measures. It also would assume enactment of policies to increase taxes for corporations and high-income individuals to raise \$5.7 trillion in revenues." The House rejected the substitute by a vote of 84 to 327. \[House Vote 85, [3/20/13](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll085.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/20/13](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2013/H/85?0); Congressional Actions, [H.Con.Res. 25](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/25/all-actions)\]
