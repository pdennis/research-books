### Elimination

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating And Replacing The IRS.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted for a budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555, [10/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll555.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/5/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/555?2); Congressional Actions, [H.

Res. 71](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/71/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Called For Eliminating The IRS And Replacing It With Something Else.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "This budget takes the bold step of calling for the complete elimination of the IRS. Tax collection and enforcement activities would be moved to new, smaller, and more accountable departments at the Treasury focused on service for the taxpayers, including a family and individual unit, a business unit, and an independent dispute resolution unit. Applicants to the new department would need to undergo a rigorous evaluation of their work performance before being hired to positions of trust, and would be subject to discipline and termination if they failed to honor that trust. This fresh start is necessary to reassure Americans that the agency with access to every paycheck is trustworthy and honest." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed 10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]

### Funding

**2017: Schweikert Voted To Cut The IRS's Operations Budget By \$165,300.** In September 2017, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "decrease\[d\] funding for Internal Revenue Service operations support by \$165,300, and would transfer the savings to the spending reduction account." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 omnibus. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 186 to 223. \[House Vote 519, [9/14/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll519.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/14/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/519?0); Congressional Actions, [H.

### Koskinen Impeachment

**2016: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against Killing A Resolution Impeaching IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.** In December 2016, Schweikert voted against a motion that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "refer\[ed\] the resolution to the House Judiciary Committee. The resolution would \[have\] impeach\[ed\] IRS Commissioner John Koskinen for high crimes and misdemeanors and would \[have\] provide\[d\] that the resolution's four articles of impeachment be exhibited to the Senate." According to Congressional Quarterly, the motion "effectively kills the matter for now." The vote was on the motion, the House adopted the motion by a vote of 342 to 72. \[House Vote 608, [12/6/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll608.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/6/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/608?66); Congressional Quarterly, [12/6/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4999538?26); Congressional Actions, [H. Res. 828](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-resolution/828/all-actions)\]

-   **Some Republicans Claimed That Koskinen Destroyed Documents, Failed To Comply With A Congressioanl Subpoena And Committed Perjury Related To An Investigation Over The IRS Targeting Conservative Groups.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The targeting of conservative groups occurred before Koskinen took office in 2013 and the official in charge of the tax-exempt unit, Lois Lerner, was forced to resign. Jordan's privileged resolution alleges Koskinen destroyed evidence related to the IRS' handling of applications from groups seeking tax-exempt status, failed to comply with a congressional subpoena to turn over evidence, and made false statements to Congress under oath." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/6/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4999538?26)\]

-   **No Formal Impeachment Hearings Were Held Prior To The Votes.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Our founders provided the Congress with impeachment authority to be used only in the most serious of circumstances. Introducing an impeachment resolution with no formal impeachment hearings in the closing hours of the Congress is not a serious proposal and should be opposed,' Reginald J. Brown said in a written statement." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/6/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4999538?26)\]

**2016: Schweikert Voted Against Tabling A Resolution Impeaching IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.** In December 2016, Schweikert voted against a motion that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "table\[d\] (kill\[ed\]) the resolution that would impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen for high crimes and misdemeanors and would provide that the resolution's four articles of impeachment be exhibited to the Senate." The vote was on the motion, the House rejected the motion by a vote of 180 to 235. The House later adopted a resolution effectively killing the resolution of impeachment by sending the resolution to the House Judiciary committee. \[House Vote 607, [12/6/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll607.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/6/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/607?66); Congressional Quarterly, [12/6/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4999538?26); Congressional Actions, [H.

### Setting The Salary Of The IRS Commissioner At \$0

**2016: Schweikert Voted To Set The Salary Of The IRS Commissioner At \$0 Dollars From The Underlying Bill's Enactment Date Through The End Of President Obama's Presidency.** In July 2016, Schweikert voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] funds from being used to pay the salary of the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service from the date of enactment until Jan. 20 2017, at a rate greater than a pro-rated annual rate of \$0." The underlying legislation was an FY 2017 financial services and general government appropriations bill. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 197 to 224. \[House Vote 378, [7/7/16](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll378.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/7/16](http://cq.com/vote/2016/H/378?17); Congressional Actions, [H. Amdt. 1243](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house-amendment/1243/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5485](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5485/all-actions)\]

-   **John Koskinen, The IRS Commissioner, Was Accused Of Providing False Testimony By Congressional Republicans Involving Testimony Regarding The IRS's Alleged Targeting Of Conservative Tax-Exempt Organizations.** According to the New York Times, "When the House Judiciary Committee convenes on Tuesday to consider the alleged misdeeds of the Internal Revenue Service commissioner, John Koskinen, it will contemplate action that has not been taken in more than 140 years, and that in some respects has never been pursued: the impeachment of an agency head of Mr. Koskinen's rank. \[...\] Mr. Koskinen was not even in government when the I.R.S. admitted to singling out the tax-exemption applications of Tea Party groups for scrutiny. Organizations on the I.R.S.'s "lookout lists" went beyond conservative groups to include groups like Palestinian rights activists and open-software developers, but the scrutiny of hundreds of Tea Party applicants infuriated congressional Republicans. \[...\]But amid the mishandling of email messages sought as evidence by House investigators, that fury turned on him. Mr. Koskinen will not appear at the Tuesday hearing, the I.R.S. said on Monday, because he just returned from a multinational tax conference in China and had little time to prepare given the committee's recent invitation. 'He provided, I think, a whole series of false testimony,' said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who is one of the leaders of the push for impeachment. 'You can't be under a duly issued subpoena and mislead Congress, and when you provide false testimony there has to be a consequence.'" \[New York Times, [5/23/16](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/us/politics/house-set-to-begin-irs-commissioners-impeachment-hearing.html)\]

### Staff Reduction

**2015: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2016 Budget Resolution Which Called For Reducing The IRS's Staff.** In March 2015, Schweikert voted against the FY 2016 budget resolution which called for reducing the staff of the IRS. According to Congressional Quarterly, the resolution suggests eliminating the "Election Assistance Commission, further reductions in IRS staffing (on the basis that tax reform will significantly simplify the tax code) and the promotion of electronic copies of government documents to further reduce printing costs." The vote was on the budget resolution. The House passed the resolution 228 to 199. The budget resolution died in the Senate, but a similar concurrent resolution did pass both Houses. \[House Vote 142, [3/25/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll142.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/23/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4648745?4); Congressional Actions, [S.
