### Funding

**2023: Schweikert Voted To Rescind \$71 Billion In IRS Funding Provided By The Inflation Reduction Act For Tax Enforcement And Operations.** In January 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted for the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act, which would "rescind unobligated balances from \$71 billion appropriated to the IRS in the fiscal 2022 budget reconciliation bill (PL 117-169) for tax enforcement and operations support, as well as \$726 million for a task force to design a free direct e-file system for tax returns; the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration; Office of Tax Policy functions related to promulgating tax regulations; the U.S. Tax Court; and Treasury Department oversight and support of the IRS. It would not rescind any funding from the \$3.1 billion provided by the reconciliation bill for taxpayer services or the \$4.7 billion for business systems modernization." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 221 to 210, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 25, [1/9/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll025.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/9/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/25?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 23](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/23/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Would Rescind Most Of The \$80 Billion Appropriation For The IRS Over A Decade.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Adrian Smith is kicking off this week as sponsor of the first bill (HR 23) scheduled for a vote in the House this Congress, a measure to rescind most of Democrats' nearly \$80 billion in new funding for the IRS over a decade." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/9/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-7637030?6)\]

-   **The Bill Would Have Rescinded \$71.5 Billion In Funding For The IRS, Which Was Part Of 2022's Climate, Tax And Health Care Reconciliation Bill And Was Meant For Tax Code Enforcement And Crack Down On Tax Evaders.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The new Republican-controlled House passed a bill to claw back \$71.5 billion in funding for the IRS that was part of Democrats' climate, tax and health care reconciliation law last year. The party-line 221-210 vote was the first legislative act of the new Congress, showing Republicans' interest in proving their opposition to Democrats' effort to boost tax code enforcement and crack down on tax avoidance." \[Congressional Quarterly, [1/9/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7637310?8)\]

**2023: Schweikert Effectively Voted For Family And Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act, Which Would Rescind IRS Funding Provided By The Inflation Reduction Act.** In January 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against the "motion to recommit the bill that would rescind IRS funding appropriated by the fiscal 2022 budget reconciliation bill (PL 117-169) to the House Ways and Means Committee." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 208-221, thus the House voted on passage subsequently. \[House Vote 24, [1/9/23](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll024.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [1/9/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/24?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 23](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/23/all-actions)\]

The vote was on a motion to concur. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote 220-207, thus the bill was sent to President Biden for final signage.

-   **To Offset Costs Of The Spending Included In The Inflation Reduction Act, The Bill Provided Almost \$80 Billion To The Internal Revenue Service For Tax Enforcement And Combat Tax Evasion.** According to The Washington Post, "To pay for the spending, Democrats included a new tax on a set of large companies that currently pay nothing to the U.S. government, and added about \$80 billion for the IRS to pursue those who dodge what they owe." \[The Washington Post, [8/7/22](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/08/07/senate-inflation-reduction-act-climate/)\]
