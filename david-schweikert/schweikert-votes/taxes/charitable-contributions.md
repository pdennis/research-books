# Charitable Contributions

### Make Certain Charitable Tax Incentives Permanent

**2015: Schweikert Voted For Extending Permanently State And Local Sales Tax Deduction As Part Of A Larger Tax Extender Passage.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted to extend permanently the state and local sales tax deduction. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "ma\[de\] permanent a number of tax provisions intended to provide incentives for charitable giving, including those related to contributions from certain retirement accounts, food contributions, conservation property and the treatment of certain controlling exempt organizations. JCT estimates that these charitable provisions would cost up to \$12.3 billion over 10 years." The vote was on concurring in the Senate amendment to the bill with an amendment. The House passed the amendment by a vote of 318 to 109. The legislation was later combined with an Omnibus appropriations bill. The Senate passed the larger measure and the president signed it. \[House Vote 703, [12/17/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll703.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/16/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4808184?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2029](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029/all-actions)\]

### Permanent Extension

**2014: Schweikert Voted For Making Permanent A Number Of Tax Provisions Related To Charitable Giving Without Offsets.** In December 2014, Schweikert voted for making permanent a number of tax provisions related to charitable giving with no offsets. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "ma\[d\]e permanent a number of tax provisions intended to promote charitable giving, including those related to food contributions, conservation property and contributions from certain retirement accounts." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill, requiring a two-thirds majority, or 284 in this case. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 275 to 149. \[House Vote 562, [12/11/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll562.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/11/14](http://cq.com/vote/2014/H/562?6); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5806](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/5806/all-actions)\]

-   **The Administration Threated To Veto Because The Bill Lacked Offsets.** According to a Statement of Administration Policy, "However, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5806, which would permanently extend three current provisions that offer enhanced tax breaks for certain donations. As the Administration stated when strongly opposing similar legislation this past July, if this same, unprecedented approach of making certain traditional tax extenders permanent without offsets were followed for the other traditional tax extenders, it would add \$500 billion or more to deficits over the next ten years, wiping out most of the deficit reduction achieved through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. \[...\] If the President were presented with H.R. 5806, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \[Statement of Administration Policy, [12/10/14](http://www.cq.com/pdf/4585119.pdf)\]
