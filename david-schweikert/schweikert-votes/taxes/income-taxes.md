### Charitable Giving

**2015: Schweikert Voted For Making Permanent A Number Of Tax Provisions Related To Charitable Giving.** In February 2015, Schweikert voted for making permanent a number of tax provisions related to charitable giving. According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill would have "ma\[de\] permanent a number of tax provisions intended to provide incentives for charitable giving --- including those related to food contributions, conservation property, contributions from certain retirement accounts and the treatment of private foundations. \[...\] In total, the \[...\] measure could reduce revenues by as much as \$14.3 billion over 10 years. The measure includes no offsets." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 279 to 137. The bill was then used for a time as a vehicle for a different measure. \[House Vote 80, [2/12/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll080.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/6/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4619982/8?126&search=W9arq4jV); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 644](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/644)\]

-   **Tax Extenders Are A Series Of Tax Provisions That Congress Periodically Extends, But Only For A Year Or Two.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Congress has repeatedly had to address the renewal of the so-called 'extenders': non-permanent tax provisions such as the research and development tax credit for businesses that usually are renewed for only a year or two at a time. Lawmakers in both parties have expressed an interest in permanently addressing the extenders through a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code, under which individual extender tax policies would be re-evaluated and modified, eliminated or made permanent." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/6/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4619982/9?17&search=nS8jCJbn)\]

-   **The Administration Threated To Veto Because The Bill Lacked Offsets.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House's action Friday follows approval of package (HR 644) of tax credits for charitable giving Thursday. The White House has threatened a veto of the measure, as it has for other permanent tax extenders, because there are no offsets. In its position statement on the bill, the administration said House Republicans are attempting to add to the deficit to continue tax breaks for businesses, after insisting on offsetting the cost of Democratic measures, such as an extension of unemployment benefits." \[Congressional Quarterly, [2/13/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4624923?130&search=2TWgeZ4F)\]
