**2015: Schweikert Voted Against Modifying IRS Auditing Rules For Partnerships As Part Of The Bipartisan Budget Act Of 2015.** In October 2015, Schweikert voted against modifying IRS auditing rules for partnerships. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure modifies current IRS auditing rules to enhance the auditing of partnerships for tax compliance. Partnerships are generally defined as unincorporated organizations in which partners come together to conduct an active trade or business, and they include hedge funds and private equity firms. CBO estimates that these provisions would increase revenues by \$11.2 billion over the 10-year period." The measure was part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which also "would suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2017 and increase\[d\] the discretionary spending cap for fiscal 2016 by \$50 billion and for fiscal 2017 by \$30 billion, with the increases split equally between defense and non-defense spending" among other provisions." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment with an amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 266 to 167. The Senate later passed the bill and the president later signed it into law. \[House Vote 579, [10/30/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll579.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/30/15](http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/S/292?3); Congressional Quarterly, [10/27/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4780157?6); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1314](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1314/all-actions)\]
