# Tax Penalties

### Foreign-Tied Political Donors

**2024: Schweikert Voted To Impose Tax Penalties On Tax-Exempt Organizations That Donate To Political Committees If They Had Received A Contribution From A Foreign National In The Last Eight Years.** In September 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would impose penalties on certain tax exempt organizations that make contributions to U.S. political committees after receiving a gift or contribution from a foreign national within the previous eight years. Under the measure, the penalty for such actions would be 200 percent of the value of the offending contribution. Upon the organization's third such contribution, it would lose its tax-exempt status. The provisions would apply to tax exempt 501(c) organizations with assets of \$500,000 or more that have gross receipts of \$200,000 or more during the year, beginning with donations made starting Jan. 1, 2025." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 181. \[House Vote 418, [9/17/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll418.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/17/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/418?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 8314](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8314/all-actions)\]

### Terrorism-Supporting Groups

**2024: Schweikert Voted To End Tax-Exempt Status For Organizations That Supported Terrorist Organizations Within Three Years.** In November 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would provide federal tax relief for individuals held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad as well as their spouses and dependants. The bill would direct the Treasury Department to suspend tax collection, penalties and interest payments for such individuals identified by the secretary of State and attorney general. It would direct the department to establish a process for such individuals to apply for a refund for interest payments or tax penalties imposed during their imprisonment. The application process would be open to individuals wrongfully detained between Jan. 1, 2021, and the date of the bill's enactment. It also would end the tax-exempt status of groups that support, or have supported, terrorist organizations over the past three years but allows such entities to demonstrate they are not providing such support. It would further require the Treasury Department to rescind a designation if it was made erroneously or if the organization certifies it never received notice of the department's intent to revoke its tax-exempt status. The IRS Independent Office of Appeals would be granted authority under the bill to dispute the designation of organizations while federal district courts would have jurisdiction to review the final designation of an organization. The bill's provisions would take effect for the tax years ending after its enactment." The House passed the bill by a vote of 219 to 184. \[House Vote 477, [11/21/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll477.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/21/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/477?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 9495](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9495/all-actions)\]
