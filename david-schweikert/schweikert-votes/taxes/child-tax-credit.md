# Child Tax Credit

### Expanded Child Tax Credit

**2015: Schweikert Voted For Extending Permanently The American Opportunity Tax Credit And The Expanded Child Tax Credit And The Earned Income Tax Credit As Part Of A Larger Tax Extender Passage.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted to extend permanently three individual income-tax provisions that were expanded in the 2009 stimulus. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "made permanent \[...\] the \[...\] expanded versions of the child tax credit, Earned Income Tax Credit and American Opportunity Tax Credit." The underlying measure would "retroactively \[renew\] for the current 2015 tax year most of the expired provisions and further extends them for varying periods, including by making more than a dozen permanent and extending most others for two years (2015 and 2016)." The vote was on concurring in the Senate amendment to the bill with an amendment. The House passed the amendment by a vote of 318 to 109. The legislation was later combined with an Omnibus appropriations bill. The Senate passed the larger measure and the president signed it. \[House Vote 703, [12/17/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll703.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/16/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4808184?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2029](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Made Permanent The Reduced Floor For Claiming The Credit; Cost Nearly \$90 Billion Over Ten Years.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure permanently extends changes to the \$1,000 child tax credit made by the stimulus law that reduced from \$10,000 to \$3,000 (not indexed for inflation) the 'floor' for claiming the credit: i.e., the point at which adjusted gross income must exceed an inflation-adjusted threshold in order for a taxpayer to receive the refundable credit (worth up to 15% of income in excess of the threshold). This is also known as the earned income formula. Making the provision permanent is estimated to cost \$87.8 billion over 10 years, all of which would be spending outlays." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/16/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4808184?7)\]

### Expansion

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The House GOP's 2017 Tax Reform Plan Which Significantly Cut Taxes For The Rich And Corporations And Slightly Expanded The Child Tax Credit.** In November 2017, Schweikert voted for reconciliation legislation which significantly altered the federal tax code. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill substantially restructures the U.S. tax code to simplify the code and reduce taxes on individuals, corporations and small businesses. For individuals, it consolidates the current seven tax brackets down to four and eliminates or restricts many tax credits and deductions, including by eliminating the deduction for state and local income taxes and limiting the deduction for property taxes to \$10,000 and the interest deduction for a home mortgage to the first \$500,000 worth of a loan. \[...\] On the business side, it reduces the corporate tax from 35% to 20% and establishes a 'territorial' tax system that would exempt most income derived overseas from U.S. corporate taxation. It allows businesses to immediately expense 100% of the cost of assets acquired and placed into service, and for small businesses it raises the Section 179 expensing limit to \$5 million for five years. It also establishes a 25% rate for a portion of pass-through business income that would otherwise have to be paid at the ordinary individual tax level, and for small businesses where an individual would receive less than \$150,000 in pass-through income it taxes the first \$75,000 of that income at a 9% rate." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 227 to 205. President Trump later signed an amended version of the bill into law. \[House Vote 637, [11/16/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll637.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/15/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5217156?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation In Part Replaces The Personal Exemption By Creating A \$300 Credit For Parents And Non-Children Dependents -- But For Only Five Years - And Increases The Child Tax Credit By \$600.** According to Vox, "The child tax credit, currently \$1,000, will grow to \$1,600, and a new \$300 credit for parents and other non-child dependents in the house (the \$300 credit expires after five years, presumably to save money)." \[Vox, [11/16/17](https://www.vox.com/2017/11/2/16596896/house-republican-tax-reform-cuts-trump-ryan-explained)\]

**2017: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2018 Congressional Progressive Caucus's Budget Resolution, Which Among Other Things, Increased Taxes On The Rich And Corporations And Called Expanding The Child Tax Credit And The EITC.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted against an FY 2018 CPC budget resolution. According to Congressional Quarterly, the resolution would "provide for \$3.8 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018, not including off-budget accounts. It would raise overall spending by \$3.5 trillion over 10 years and would increase revenues by \$8.2 trillion over the same period through policies that would increase taxes for corporations and high-income individuals. It would repeal the Budget Control Act sequester and caps on discretionary spending, would modify the tax code by adding five higher marginal tax rates, would create a public insurance option to be sold within the current health insurance exchanges and would call for implementation of comprehensive immigration overhaul." In addition, according to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, "Expands the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Care Credit." The amendment was a substitute amendment for the GOP's FY 2018 budget resolution in part designed to start the process for tax reform. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 108 to 314. \[House Vote 553, [10/4/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll553.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/4/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/553?1); Congressional Progressive Caucus, [Accessed 10/12/17](https://cpc-grijalva.house.gov/the-peoples-budget-a-roadmap-for-the-resistance-fy-2018); Congressional Actions, [H.

### Extension

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Authorizing \$5 Billion To Extend The Child Tax Credit Through 2022.** In November 2021, Schweikert voted against the Build Back Better act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "extend through 2022 the expanded child tax credit provided by prior coronavirus relief law (PL 117-2) and provide \$5 billion to administer the credit." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 220-213. \[House Vote 385, [11/19/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll385.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/19/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/385?16); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5376](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/actions)\]

The vote was on concurring in the Senate amendment to the bill. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote of 220-211 and sent to the President and ultimately the bill became law. \[House Vote 72, [3/10/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll072.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/10/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/72?24); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1319](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/actions)\]

Biden and his congressional Democratic allies have estimated the changes could cut child poverty by up to half." \[The Washington Post, [3/10/21](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/03/10/house-stimulus-biden-covid-relief-checks/)\]

Families eligible for the full credit will get payments of up to \$300 per child per month from July through the end of the year." \[NPR, [3/11/21](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/03/09/974841565/heres-whats-in-the-american-rescue-plan-as-it-heads-toward-final-passage)\]

**2014: Schweikert Voted For Legislation That Permanently Extended Part Of The Child Tax Credit, While Not Offsetting The Costs While Failing To Extend A Provision Helping Low-Income Families.** In July 2014, Schweikert voted for a bill that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "ma\[d\]e permanent a modified child tax credit that would eliminate the credit's 'marriage penalty' by increasing the income threshold to \$150,000 for joint returns. It also would index for inflation both the \$1,000 tax credit and its income phaseout thresholds." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 237 to 173. The bill died in the Senate. \[House Vote 451, [7/25/14](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll451.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [7/25/14](http://cq.com/vote/2014/H/451?0); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 4935](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4935/all-actions)\]

They also argue that it is unfair to allow the expansions of the refundable portion that benefit low-income families to expire in 2017 while expanding and making permanent provisions that benefit more upper-middle-income families." \[Congressional Quarterly, [7/21/14](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4519031/28)\]
