# Earned Income Tax Credit

**2015: Schweikert Voted For Extending Permanently The American Opportunity Tax Credit And The Expanded Child Tax Credit And The Earned Income Tax Credit As Part Of A Larger Tax Extender Passage.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted to extend permanently three individual income-tax provisions that were expanded in the 2009 stimulus. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "made permanent \[...\] the \[...\] expanded versions of the child tax credit, Earned Income Tax Credit and American Opportunity Tax Credit. \[...\] The earned income tax credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit designed to ease the tax burden on certain low-income workers and is phased out as income exceeds certain levels." The underlying measure would "retroactively \[renew\] for the current 2015 tax year most of the expired provisions and further extends them for varying periods, including by making more than a dozen permanent and extending most others for two years (2015 and 2016)." The vote was on concurring in the Senate amendment to the bill with an amendment. The House passed the amendment by a vote of 318 to 109. The legislation was later combined with an Omnibus appropriations bill. The Senate passed the larger measure and the president signed it. \[House Vote 703, [12/17/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll703.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/16/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4808184?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2029](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029/all-actions)\]

-   **Legislation Reduced The 'Marriage Penalty" And Increased The EITC Credit Percentage For Families With Three Or More Child.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure permanently extends certain adjustments to the EITC included in the stimulus law that increased the beginning point of the phase-out range for all married couples by \$5,000 (indexed for inflation), thus reducing the so-called 'marriage penalty.' This provision is estimated to cost \$11.2 billion over 10 years, \$9.3 billion of which would be spending outlays. It also makes permanent stimulus law provisions that increased the EITC credit percentage to 45% for families with three or more children. This provision is estimated to cost \$19.2 billion over 10 years, \$18.3 billion of which would be spending outlays." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/16/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4808184?7)\]

### Expansion

**2017: Schweikert Voted Against The FY 2018 Congressional Progressive Caucus's Budget Resolution, Which Among Other Things, Increased Taxes On The Rich And Corporations And Called Expanding The Child Tax Credit And The EITC.** In October 2017, Schweikert voted against an FY 2018 CPC budget resolution. According to Congressional Quarterly, the resolution would "provide for \$3.8 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018, not including off-budget accounts. It would raise overall spending by \$3.5 trillion over 10 years and would increase revenues by \$8.2 trillion over the same period through policies that would increase taxes for corporations and high-income individuals. It would repeal the Budget Control Act sequester and caps on discretionary spending, would modify the tax code by adding five higher marginal tax rates, would create a public insurance option to be sold within the current health insurance exchanges and would call for implementation of comprehensive immigration overhaul." In addition, according to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, "Expands the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Care Credit." The amendment was a substitute amendment for the GOP's FY 2018 budget resolution in part designed to start the process for tax reform. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 108 to 314. \[House Vote 553, [10/4/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll553.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [10/4/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/553?1); Congressional Progressive Caucus, [Accessed 10/12/17](https://cpc-grijalva.house.gov/the-peoples-budget-a-roadmap-for-the-resistance-fy-2018); Congressional Actions, [H.

### Extension

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against The American Rescue Plan Act Of 2021, Which Expanded The Maximum Earned Income Tax Credit For Adults Without Kids.** In March 2021, Schweikert voted against concurring in the Senate amendment to the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "expand eligibility and increase the maximum earned income tax credit for childless adults and increase the child tax credit to \$3,000 per child." The vote was on concurring in the Senate amendment to the bill. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote of 220-211 and sent to the President and ultimately the bill became law. \[House Vote 72, [3/10/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll072.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/10/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/72?24); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1319](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/actions)\]
