# Corporate Tax Credits

### Bonuses For Domestic Material Use

**2022: Schweikert Voted Against Establishing Bonus Corporate Tax Credits For Using Domestic Materials In Their Facilities.** In August 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Schweikert voted against concurring in the Senate amendment to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which "For most of its corporate tax credits, it would add prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements and establish bonus credits for using domestic materials in facility construction." The vote was on a motion to concur. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote 220-207, thus the bill was sent to President Biden for final signage. President Biden signed the bill and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 420, [8/12/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll420.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [8/12/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/420?6); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5376](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/actions)\]
