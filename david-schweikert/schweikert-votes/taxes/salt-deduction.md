# State And Local Tax Deduction

### Cap

**2021: Schweikert Voted Against Increasing The Annual Cap On The Deduction For State And Local Taxes From \$10,000 To \$80,000 For Tax Years 2021 Through 2030.** In November 2021, Schweikert voted against the Build Back Better act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "temporarily increase from \$10,000 to \$80,000 the annual cap on the deduction for state and local taxes for tax years 2021 through 2030." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 220-213. \[House Vote 385, [11/19/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll385.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/19/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/385?16); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5376](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/actions)\]

**2021: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against A Manager's Amendment To The Build Back Better Act, Which Would Increase The Raised Annual Cap To \$80,000 On State And Local Tax Deductions For 2021 Through 2030 And Reinstate The Cap To \$10,000 In 2031.** In November 2021, Schweikert voted against the adoption of the rule which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for automatic adoption of a Yarmuth, D-Ky., manager\'s amendment to HR 5376 that would increase from \$72,500 to \$80,000 the raised annual cap on the deduction for state and local taxes for tax years 2021 through 2030, but reinstate the original cap of \$10,000 in 2031." The vote was on the adoption of the rule. The House adopted the rule by a vote of 221-213, thus the manager's amendment was automatically adopted. \[House Vote 372, [11/6/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll372.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/6/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/372?3); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5376](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 774](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/774/actions)\]

-   **Before The Amendment, The Legislation Increased The Cap On The Deduction Of State And Local Taxes To \$72,500 From \$10,000 And Extended The Higher Cap Through 2031.** According to CBS News, "The latest version also increases the cap on the deduction of state and local taxes (known as SALT) from \$10,000 to \$72,500 (or \$36,250 in the case of an estate, trust or married individual filing a separate return), and extends the higher cap through 2031, instead of 2025." \[CBS News, [11/6/21](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/infrastructure-bill-build-back-better-house-vote-biden-remarks-2021-11-06/)\]

**2021: Schweikert Effectively Voted Against A Manager's Amendment To The Build Back Better Act, Which Would Increase The Raised Annual Cap To \$80,000 On State And Local Tax Deductions For 2021 Through 2030 And Reinstate The Cap To \$10,000 In 2031.** In November 2021, Schweikert voted against the motion to order the previous question on the rule which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for automatic adoption of a Yarmuth, D-Ky., manager\'s amendment to HR 5376 that would increase from \$72,500 to \$80,000 the raised annual cap on the deduction for state and local taxes for tax years 2021 through 2030, but reinstate the original cap of \$10,000 in 2031." The vote was on a motion to order the previous question. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 221-213. \[House Vote 371, [11/6/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll371.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [11/6/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/371?5); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 5376](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/actions); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 774](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/774/actions)\]

### Increase

**2024: Schweikert Effectively Voted To Increase The State And Local Tax Deduction.** In February 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "adoption of the rule (H Res 994) that would provide for floor consideration of the SALT Marriage Penalty Elimination Act (HR 7160) and the resolution (H Res 987) denouncing the Biden administration\'s energy policies. The rule would provide for up to one hour of debate on each bill." The vote was on the rule. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 195 to 225. \[House Vote 48, [2/14/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll048.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [2/14/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/48?4); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 994](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/994/all-actions); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 7160](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7160/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Would Have Doubled The State And Local Tax Deduction For Households Earning Under \$500,000.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House rejected a rule that would provide for floor consideration of a bill to double the cap on state and local tax deductions for married couples earning up to \$500,000, striking a blow to legislation championed by blue-state Republicans." \[Congressional Quarterly, 2/14/24\]

### Repeal

**2017: Schweikert Voted For The Final Version Of Trump's Tax Reform Plan, Which Substantially Cut Taxes For Rich Americans And Corporations, And Significantly Lowered The State And Local Tax Deduction.** In December 2017, Schweikert voted for the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, also known as Trump's tax reform bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "This Conference Summary deals with the conference report on HR 1, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the House will consider Tuesday. The agreement significantly cuts corporate and individual taxes and seeks to simply the tax code, although most individual tax provisions would expire after 2025. It reduces the corporate tax from 35% to 21% and reduces taxation of so-called 'pass-through' businesses where profits are taxed at the individual rate. For corporate taxes it also establishes a 'territorial' tax system that exempts most overseas income from U.S. taxation. Most individual tax rate rates would be reduced, including by dropping the top rate from 39.6% to 37%, and it eliminates personal exemptions but nearly doubles the standard deduction so fewer taxpayers will itemize deductions." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 227 to 203. The Senate later passed a slightly modified version of the bill, which the House later agreed to. President Trump later signed an amended version of the bill into law. \[House Vote 692, [12/19/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll692.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/18/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5236225?0); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions)\]

-   **Bill Capped The State And Local Tax Deduction At \$10,000, For Individuals Or Married Couple.** "You can deduct just \$10,000 in state, local and property taxes: One of the most controversial parts of the GOP tax plan is the push to greatly scale back how much state and local taxes Americans can deduct on their federal income taxes. Under current law, the state and local deduction (SALT) is unlimited. In the final GOP plan, people can deduct up to \$10,000 (married couples are also limited to just \$10,000). \[...\] The move is widely viewed as a hit to blue states such as New York, Connecticut and California, and there are concerns it could cause property values to fall in high-tax cities and leave less money for public schools and road repairs." \[Washington Post, [12/15/17](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/15/the-final-gop-tax-bill-is-complete-heres-what-is-in-it/?utm_term=.6baabd4ead20)\]

-   **The State And Local Tax Deduction Is Effectively A Subsidy For Local Services.** According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, "Second, the SALT deduction helps state and local governments fund public services that provide widely shared benefits. That's because, with this deduction, higher-income filers are more willing to support state and local taxes. Repealing the deduction would almost certainly make it harder for states and localities --- many of which already face serious budget strains --- to raise sufficient revenues in the coming years to invest in high-quality education, infrastructure, and other priorities crucial to the nation's long-term economic prospects. State borrowing costs could also rise as bond rating agencies react to the reduced capacity of states to raise adequate revenue, making needed infrastructure projects more expensive. States and localities could also respond by raising taxes or fees that fall less heavily on the higher-income residents most affected by the deduction's loss. That would push more costs to middle- and low-income people, and make state and local tax systems even more regressive overall than they already are." \[Center on Budget Policy Priorities, [10/24/17](https://www.cbpp.org/blog/repeal-of-state-and-local-deduction-is-a-poor-trade-for-tax-cuts-for-wealthy)\]

**2017: Schweikert Effectively Voted To Repeal The State And Local Tax Deduction For Income Taxes.** In December 2017, Schweikert voted against a motion that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "instruct\[ed\] conferees to disagree with the Senate amendment that would repeal the individual health insurance mandate, and to recede from the section House bill that would eliminate the deduction for state and local income taxes through 2025." The vote was on a motion to instruct the conference committee on the tax reform bill. The House rejected to the motion by a vote of 186 to 233. \[House Vote 654, [12/4/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll654.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/4/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/654?0); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions)\]

### Restoration

**2019: Schweikert Voted Against Restoring The State And Local Tax Deductions, Lifting A \$10,000 Limit Put In Place By The Trump Tax Reform Bill.** In December 2019, Schweikert voted against a bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would reduce or eliminate the existing \$10,000 cap on federal tax deductions for state and local taxes, which was established under the 2017 tax law, for tax years 2019 through 2021. Specifically, it would double the cap to \$20,000 for married couples filing a joint tax return for tax year 2019, and it would eliminate the cap for tax years 2020 and 2021. As amended, the bill would retain the cap for taxpayers whose adjusted gross incomes exceed \$100 million in a taxable year. As an offset, the bill would increase the top individual income tax rate from 37% to 39.6% and it would reduce the corresponding income thresholds at which the top tax bracket applies." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 218-206. \[House Vote 700, [12/19/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll700.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/19/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/700?6); Congressional Actions, [H.R.5377](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/5377/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+5377%22%5D%7d&s=2&r=1)\]

-   **Restoring The SALT Deductions Was A Top Democratic Priority, Though The Move Was Largely Symbolic.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "House Democrats dealt a symbolic blow to Republicans\' tax code overhaul Thursday on the two-year anniversary of that law\'s passage \[...\] \[the bill\] would make good on a top Democratic tax priority: lifting a \$10,000 limit on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/19/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5799212?14)\]

-   **The Bill Allowed Taxpayers To Write Off The Full Cost Of SALT And Doubled The SALT Deduction Limit For Married Couples.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill would generally give taxpayers a two-year reprieve on the deduction limit Republicans imposed as part of their 2017 tax code overhaul. Taxpayers would be able to write off the full cost of state and local taxes when they file 2020 and 2021 federal returns. The measure would also double the SALT deduction limit for married couples on 2019 returns." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/19/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5799212?14)\]

-   **Joint Committee On Taxation: The Bill Would Provide \$61 Billion In Tax Cuts, With 59% Of The Total Benefit Going To Households That Earn More Than \$500,000.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, in 2021 the total tax cut under the combined effect of removing the SALT cap and raising the top rate would be \$61 billion. Of that figure, about 59 percent of the total benefit would flow to households earning more than \$500,000, who would get an average tax cut of about \$18,000. For millionaire households, the average tax cut jumps to nearly \$32,000." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/19/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5799212?14)\]

-   **Congressional Quarterly: The Bill Disproportionately Benefited High-Tax States, Which Democrats Believed Would "Even The Score" After the GOP Tax Bill Imposed The SALT Cap "To Punish Blue States."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The benefit is unevenly distributed among the states, however. According to a study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, just three states --- New York, New Jersey and California --- would see nearly 59 percent of the benefit. Those three states have 21 percent of the U.S. population, according to census data \[...\] Democrats said the bill would simply even the score with the 2017 tax law, which cut taxes for households in lower-tax states while raising them on their own constituents. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters earlier that Republicans imposed the SALT cap in order 'to punish blue states.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/19/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5799212?14)\]

-   **The Bill Increased The Top Marginal Tax Rate From 37 Percent To 36.9 Percent To Make Up For Lost Revenue.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "To make up for the bill's estimated \$184.5 billion drain in federal revenues over the coming decade, the measure would increase the top marginal tax rate for individuals from 37 percent to 39.6 percent --- the same level that existed before the GOP tax overhaul. That rate would effectively become permanent, while the SALT cap would return in 2022 under the bill." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/20/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-5799152?26)\]

-   **Republicans Included A Provision That Prevented Households Earning More Than \$100,000 Million From Claiming Unlimited Deductions.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "in a rare procedural victory, House Republicans won approval of an amendment that would prevent households earning more than \$100 million from claiming unlimited deductions. Democratic managers of the bill initially resisted the move, but then agreed to accept it. \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/20/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-5799152?26)\]

-   **The White House Threatened To Veto The Bill If It Passed The Senate.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The White House issued a veto threat this week, saying in a statement that the bill 'would force all Federal taxpayers to subsidize a tax break for the wealthy.' The Statement of Administration Policy also said the increase in the top marginal rate would 'stifle economic growth by placing an undue burden on thousands of small businesses.'" \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/19/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5799212?14)\]

-   **Center For American Progress Opposed The Bill, Stating That It Would "Overwhelmingly Benefit The Wealthy" And "Waste The Opportunity To Invest In Other, More Progressive Priorities.** According to the Center for American Progress, "While \[the\] Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was fundamentally misguided and needs to be overhauled, fully repealing the SALT deduction limit would cost hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue and overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy, not the middle class \[...\] H.R. 5377 offsets the substantial revenue loss from repealing the SALT cap for 2020 and 2021 by restoring the pre-TCJA top individual tax rate of 39.6 percent and lowering the income thresholds above which the top rate applies. Yet dedicating that revenue to repealing the SALT cap would waste the opportunity to invest it in other, more progressive priorities." \[Center for American progress, [12/10/19](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2019/12/10/478598/repealing-salt-cap-not-top-priority-reforming-2017-tax-law/)\]

-   **Center On Budget And Policy Priorities Also Opposed The Bill, As It Would Benefit The Wealthy And Ultimately Would Not Address The "Two Central Flaws" Of The 2017 Tax Overhaul.** According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, "By itself, repealing the SALT cap would overwhelmingly benefit high-income households, since most low- and middle-income taxpayers don't face the SALT cap. In addition, paying for repeal by raising the top rate would use up a source of progressive revenue that would no longer be available to fund other, more critical priorities. As a result, the Ways and Means bill would not address two central flaws of the 2017 tax law overall: its steep cost and its heavy tilt toward wealthy individuals and profitable corporations. \[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, [12/10/19](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/repealing-salt-cap-would-be-regressive-and-proposed-offset-would-use-up-needed)\]

**2019: Schweikert Effectively Voted For An Amendment That Provided An Exception To The Bill's Elimination Of The \$10K Cap On Federal Tax Deductions For State And Local Taxes, So The Cap Would Only Apply To Incomes Over \$100 Million.** In December 2019, Schweikert voted for a motion to recommit the SALT restoration tax bill to the House Ways and Means Committee that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "report it back immediately with an amendment that would make an exception to the bill\'s elimination of the \$10,000 cap on federal tax deductions for state and local taxes, such that the cap would still apply for taxpayers whose adjusted gross incomes exceed \$100 million in a taxable year. It would double to \$1,000 the tax deductions established by the bill for professional development costs for teachers and first responders." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 388-36. \[House Vote 699, [12/19/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll699.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/19/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/699?27); Congressional Actions, [H.R.5377](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/5377/all-actions?q=%7b%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+5377%22%5D%7d&s=2&r=1)\]

-   **Congressional Quarterly: The Motion Was "Intended To Put Democrats On The Spot" But Was Ultimately Adopted As An Amendment to The Bill.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans sought to turn the tables with a procedural motion intended to put Democrats on the spot. The motion to recommit, from Tom Rice of South Carolina, would prohibit householders with adjusted gross income above \$100 million from benefiting, putting the \$7 billion in savings into doubling the new deductions for teachers and first responders. House Ways and Means Select Revenue Subcommittee Chairman Mike Thompson, D-Calif., accepted the language, however. Rice insisted on a roll call vote on his motion anyway, which was adopted 388-36. Rice's proposal was then adopted as an amendment to the underlying bill." \[Congressional Quarterly, [12/19/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5799212?14)\]
