# Work Opportunity Tax Credit

### Extending The Modified Work Opportunity Tax Credit

**2015: Schweikert Voted For Extending For Five Years A Modified Work Opportunity Tax Credit As Part Of A Larger Tax Extender Passage.** In December 2015, Schweikert voted to extend for five years the work opportunity tax credit. According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "extend\[ed\] for five years (including 2015) \[... \] \[the\] Modified Work Opportunity Tax Credit\[.\] \[...\] \[T\]he credit for wages paid to members of targeted groups, such as food stamp recipients or individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income benefits and, beginning in 2016, modifies the credit to include certain recipients of long-term unemployment insurance (those who have been unemployed 27 weeks or more) in the groups for which employers could receive the tax credit and increases the credit for the long-term unemployed to 40% of the first \$6,000 in wages (estimated \$9 billion cost over 10 years)." The underlying measure would "retroactively \[renew\] for the current 2015 tax year most of the expired provisions and further extends them for varying periods, including by making more than a dozen permanent and extending most others for two years (2015 and 2016)." The vote was on concurring in the Senate amendment to the bill with an amendment. The House passed the amendment by a vote of 318 to 109. The legislation was later combined with an Omnibus appropriations bill. The Senate passed the larger measure and the president signed it. \[House Vote 703, [12/17/15](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll703.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [12/16/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4808184?7); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 2029](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029/all-actions)\]
