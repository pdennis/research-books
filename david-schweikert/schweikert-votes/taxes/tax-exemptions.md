**2024: Schweikert Voted To Suspend The Tax-Exempt Status Of Entities That Provide Support To Terrorist Organizations.** In April 2024, Schweikert voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would expand the authority of the Treasury Department to suspend the tax-exempt status of entities that provide material support to listed terrorist organizations. It would require the Treasury Department to send a written notice to an organization before designating it as a terrorist-supporting organization. It would require the department, after the close of a 90-day period beginning on the date such notice was sent, to designate such organization as a terrorist-supporting organization if the organization has not demonstrated that it did not provide support to a terrorist organization or has certified it will not provide further support and has made reasonable efforts to have such support returned. It also would establish administrative review procedures for an organization to challenge its designation as a terrorist-supporting organization with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals, which may be appealed in a U.S. district court." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 382 to 11. \[House Vote 121, [4/15/24](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2024/roll121.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/15/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/121?32); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 6408](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6408/all-actions)\]
