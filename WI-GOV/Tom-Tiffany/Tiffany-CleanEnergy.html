<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In 2025, Tiffany <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml">voted</a> to <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-passes-senate-megabill-trump-ira-tax-credit/752276/">repeal</a> clean energy tax credits and make them harder to access, threatening clean energy jobs in Wisconsin. Tiffany co-sponsored legislation to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, which would <a href="https://wisconsinindependent.com/politics/republicans-health-care-costs-inflation-reduction-act-repeal-tom-tiffany/">cut clean energy investments</a>. Since the beginning of the Trump administration, clean energy projects that were projected to create hundreds of jobs in Wisconsin were <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2025/08/05/trump-admin-cancels-75-million-in-climate-grants-to-wisconsin-data-shows/#:~:text=Through%20executive%20orders%20and%20the,policy%20group%20Atlas%20Public%20Policy.">cancelled</a>.</p>
<p>Tiffany had a long anti-environmental record. He had described the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as <a href="https://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/tom-tiffany-has-been-a-lightning-rod-on-environmental-issues-b99547320z1-320987941.html/">“radical,”&nbsp;</a> earned a spot on the Wisconsin League of Conservation Voters’ <a href="https://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/tom-tiffany-has-been-a-lightning-rod-on-environmental-issues-b99547320z1-320987941.html/">“dishonor roll,”&nbsp;</a>and worked to <a href="https://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/tom-tiffany-has-been-a-lightning-rod-on-environmental-issues-b99547320z1-320987941.html/">weaken environmental protections</a> and strip local communities of their authority.</p>
<h2>Tiffany Voted Against Protecting Wisconsin’s Clean Energy Jobs</h2>
<h3>Tiffany Voted To Cut Clean Energy Tax Credits That Supported Wisconsin Jobs And Co-Sponsored Legislation To Repeal The Inflation Reduction act</h3>
<h4>Tiffany Voted For The “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Which Cut Inflation Reduction Act Clean Energy Tax Credits And Made It Harder For Projects To Qualify For Clean Energy Tax Credits</h4>
<p><strong>July 2025: Tiffany Voted For The Senate FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill, The “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Which Extended $4 Trillion In Expiring Tax Cuts, Added New Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025, Tom Tiffany voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, the “motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the Wisconsin and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214. The bill was ultimately signed into law.

  <li><strong>The Republican Reconciliation Bill Restricted The Ability Of Projects To Qualify For Certain Clean Energy Tax Credits And Repealed Electric Vehicle Tax Credits. </strong>According to Utility Dive, "The bill restricts the ability of projects to qualify for the tech-neutral clean electricity 45Y production tax credit and 48E investment tax credit, shortens the timeline for those credits, and ends the 25D residential solar credit after this year. The 25E, 30D, 30C and 45W electric vehicle credits will terminate after Sept. 30. While clean energy advocates and congressional Democrats maintain that the final version of the bill goes too far in slashing IRA credits, some Republicans wanted to see more significant cuts."

  <li><strong>The Final Republican Reconciliation Bill Allowed Projects To Avoid A Requirement That They Be In Service By 2027 To Qualify For Certain Credits If They Began Construction Within A Year Of The Bill Being Signed.&nbsp;</strong>According to Utility Dive, "Before the House Freedom Caucus reached an agreement with House leadership to vote in favor of the bill, the caucus circulated a memo that criticized the Senate’s version of the bill for offering an exemption from the House’s onerous requirement that clean energy projects be placed in service by 2027 to qualify for the 45Y and 48E credits. The Senate version allows projects to avoid this requirement if they begin construction within a year after the bill is signed into law."

<h4>Tiffany Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Slashed Medicaid And SNAP And Cut Federal Support For Clean Energy Projects</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Tiffany Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Included $3.8 Trillion In Tax Cuts Offset By $1.5 Trillion In Spending Reductions To Programs Like Medicaid And The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</strong> In May 2025, Tom Tiffany voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would provide for approximately $3.8 trillion in net tax cuts and $321 billion in military, border enforcement and judiciary spending, offset by $1.5 trillion in spending reductions, as instructed in the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). It would raise the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion and provide for increased spending on defense and border security, spending cuts on social safety net programs, such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It also includes a mix of tax breaks for businesses and individuals; tax increases on universities and foundations; and a phase-down of clean energy tax credits. […] It would reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by requiring States to shoulder more of the cost, expand work requirements for SNAP, extend programs authorized under the 2018 farm bill, and prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Program. As amended, it would cap Wisconsin and local tax deductions at $40,000 for households with incomes below $500,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 215 to 214.

  <li><strong>The House Republican Budget Bill Included Cuts To Federal Tax Credits For Wind, Solar, Storage, And Other Clean Energy Projects.</strong> According to Utility Dive, "House Republicans on Thursday morning narrowly passed a sweeping budget bill that guts federal support for wind, solar, storage and other clean energy industries. The bill terminates most technology-neutral clean energy tax credits for projects placed in service after 2028 and those that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill’s passage. It also tightens restrictions on foreign entities’ involvement in projects, creating a ‘truly untenable’ situation for developers, Jefferies analysts said Thursday. Nuclear projects have more time to qualify for the credit."

  <li><strong>One Trade Association CEO Said The Bill Would Weaken Power Systems, Send Shockwaves Through The U.S. Economy, And Kill Tens Of Thousands Of Jobs.</strong> According to Utility Dive, "The House bill ‘abruptly dismantles bipartisan, long-standing tax policy that has catalyzed billions in private investment for affordable, reliable energy while sparking a rebirth of manufacturing across America,’ AEU President and CEO Heather O’Neill said. ‘If enacted as written, this bill will weaken our power system and send shockwaves throughout the U.S. economy by raising electricity prices, killing tens of thousands of jobs and ceding energy dominance to China.’" [Utility Dive,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-gop-budget-worse-than-feared-for-clean-energy-analysts/748862/">5/22/25</a>]<br>&nbsp;</li>

<p><strong>2025: Tiffany Co-Sponsored Legislation To Repeal The Inflation Reduction Act And Eliminate The Health Care And Clean Energy Investments.</strong> According to the Wisconsin Independent, “Wisconsin Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany and 15 other House Republicans have filed a bill to completely repeal the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, President Joe Biden’s health care and clean energy infrastructure law.

  <li><strong>The Inflation Reduction Act Delivered Major Clean Energy Investments And Lowered Drug Costs For Millions Of Seniors.</strong> According to the Wisconsin Independent,&nbsp;“The 2022 law, passed by Democratic majorities in Congress without a single Republican vote in favor, authorized $369 billion in energy and climate change infrastructure investments; capped out-of-pocket prescription drug and insulin costs for millions of older Americans; authorized the Medicare program to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower prices on commonly used drugs; and provided funding to the Internal Revenue Service to modernize its operations and crack down on wealthy tax evaders.” [Wisconsin Independent,&nbsp;<a href="https://wisconsinindependent.com/politics/republicans-health-care-costs-inflation-reduction-act-repeal-tom-tiffany/">1/8/25</a>]</li>

<h3>Since The Start Of 2025, Clean Energy Projects In Wisconsin That Were Supposed To Have Created Hundreds Of Jobs Were Cancelled&nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>2025: Trump’s Tax Bill And Trump Administration Executive Orders Cancelled $75 Million In Climate Grants And Clean Energy Loans Across Wisconsin.</strong> According to the Wisconsin Examiner, “Since taking office in January, Trump and congressional Republicans have attacked federal government efforts to address climate change by slashing programs and withholding money. Many of the projects that have lost money in Wisconsin were aimed at marginalized communities such as Native American tribes and Milwaukee’s Black residents — putting them in Trump’s crosshairs because of his aversion to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. […] Through executive orders and the Republican reconciliation bill signed into law in July, the administration of President Donald Trump has cancelled or proposed the cancellation of about $75 million in grants and loans meant for climate-focused projects in Wisconsin, according to data collected by the environmental policy group Atlas Public Policy.” [Wisconsin Examiner, <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2025/08/05/trump-admin-cancels-75-million-in-climate-grants-to-wisconsin-data-shows/#:~:text=Through%20executive%20orders%20and%20the,policy%20group%20Atlas%20Public%20Policy.">8/5/25</a>]<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tiffany Described The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency As “Radical”</h3>
<p><strong>2015: Tiffany Described The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency As “Radical” And Attacked Its Natural Resources Enforcement.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, “Tiffany has described the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as ‘radical.’ In a March opinion piece in the Wausau Daily Herald, he said the Obama administration has been ‘openly hostile to natural resources utilization,’ citing cases such as the EPA's action against an Alaskan gold and copper mine where fishing interests trumped mineral exploitation.” [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href="https://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/tom-tiffany-has-been-a-lightning-rod-on-environmental-issues-b99547320z1-320987941.html/">8/6/15</a>]<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tiffany’s Legislative Record Made Him One Of The Wisconsin League Of Conservation Voters’ “Dishonor Roll” Lawmakers</h3>
<h4>Tiffany Earned A Spot On The Wisconsin League Of Conservation Voters’ “Dishonor Roll” After Leading Multiple Anti-Environmental Efforts</h4>
<p><strong>2013-2014: Tiffany Earned A Spot On The Wisconsin League Of Conservation Voters’ “Dishonor Roll” After Multiple Anti-Environmental Actions.</strong> According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, “He helped lead a bitter but successful legislative fight in 2013 that eased protections for a proposed $1.5 billion open pit mine in northern Wisconsin that came to symbolize the tug-of-war between economic development and protection of natural resources. In this year's state budget, he helped to take away the powers of counties to pass tougher zoning standards near shorelines. He lobbied Gov. Scott Walker to cut funding for scientific research at the Department of Natural Resources. He pushed to make thousands more acres of state forest eligible for logging. And he supported a failed bid to boost the power of the governor by taking away the policy-setting powers of the state Natural Resources Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;His track record in the 2013-'14 legislative session earned Tiffany and two other legislators membership on the Wisconsin League of Conservation Voters' ‘dishonor roll.’” [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href="https://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/tom-tiffany-has-been-a-lightning-rod-on-environmental-issues-b99547320z1-320987941.html/">8/6/15</a>]</p>
<h5>Tiffany Brushed Off The Wisconsin League Of Conservation Voters And Displayed Their Dishonor Roll Award In His Office</h5>
<p><strong>2015: Tiffany Mocked The Wisconsin League Of Conservation Voters As “Out Of The Mainstream” And Displayed Their Dishonor Roll Award In His Office.</strong> According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, “He dismissed the League as ‘out of the mainstream.’ The award hangs on the wall of his Capitol office.” [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href="https://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/tom-tiffany-has-been-a-lightning-rod-on-environmental-issues-b99547320z1-320987941.html/">8/6/15</a>]<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tiffany Worked To Weaken Environmental Protections And To Reduce Local Control&nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>2015: The Joint Finance Panel Agreed With Tiffany’s Recommendation To Increase State Forest Logging Levels, Which Opened Up Another 37,500 Of Acres For Cutting.</strong> According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, “This year, the Joint Finance panel agreed to Tiffany's recommendation to increase logging on state forests from 67% to 75%. The change could make another 37,500 acres eligible for cutting. Democrats complained about the timing, since the public had no chance to comment.” [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href="https://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/tom-tiffany-has-been-a-lightning-rod-on-environmental-issues-b99547320z1-320987941.html/">8/6/15</a>]</p>
<p><strong>2015: Tiffany Added Legislative Language That Gave The Legislature Final Say Over Operating Rules For A Vilas County Dam Affecting More Than A Dozen Lakes, Instead Of The Department Of Natural Resources.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, “Tiffany added language giving the Legislature — not the DNR — final approval over operating rules for a controversial Vilas County dam that affects water levels on more than a dozen lakes.” [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href="https://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/tom-tiffany-has-been-a-lightning-rod-on-environmental-issues-b99547320z1-320987941.html/">8/6/15</a>]</p>
<p><strong>2015: Tiffany Weakened Local Control Over Shoreline Zoning And Prevented Counties From Enforcing Stronger Protections.</strong> According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, “He was also influential in taking away the ability of counties to pass stricter shoreline zoning laws than those in state law. Dozens of counties have approved more restrictive limits since 1995 as a tool to protect water quality, but Tiffany and others say the changes treated many property owners unfairly.” [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href="https://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/tom-tiffany-has-been-a-lightning-rod-on-environmental-issues-b99547320z1-320987941.html/">8/6/15</a>]</p>
<p><strong>2013: Tiffany Introduced Legislation That Stripped Counties And Local Communities Of Their Ability To Regulate The Sand Mining Industry.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, “In 2013, in addition to the mining bill, Tiffany introduced legislation to limit the powers of counties and local communities to impose restrictions on the sand mining industry. The type of sand found in western Wisconsin is an essential ingredient to extract oil in a process known as hydraulic fracturing. Fracking has spurred a boom in domestic oil production. Environmentalists and citizens have raised worries about the industry's potential to harm air quality and groundwater. The measure failed.” [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href="https://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/tom-tiffany-has-been-a-lightning-rod-on-environmental-issues-b99547320z1-320987941.html/">8/6/15</a>]</p>
