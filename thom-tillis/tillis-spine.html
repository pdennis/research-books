<h4><strong><u>Tillis Wrote A Column In The Washington Post Explaining Why He Would Vote In Favor Of Disapproving Of Trump’s Emergency Declaration, Saying He Couldn’t “Justify Providing The Executive With More Ways To Bypass Congress”</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Tillis Wrote A Column In The Washington Post Explaining Why He Would Vote In Favor Of The Resolution Disapproving Of The President’s National Emergency Declaration, Saying He Couldn’t “Justify Providing The Executive With More Ways To Bypass Congress.” </strong>According to Washington Post op-ed by Senator Thom Tillis, “Although Trump certainly has legitimate grievances over congressional Democrats’ obstruction of border-security funding, his national emergency declaration on Feb. 15 was not the right answer. […] As a U.S. senator, I cannot justify providing the executive with more ways to bypass Congress. As a conservative, I cannot endorse a precedent that I know future left-wing presidents will exploit to advance radical policies that will erode economic and individual freedoms. These are the reasons I would vote in favor of the resolution disapproving of the president’s national-emergency declaration, if and when it comes before the Senate.” [Senator Thom Tillis Op-Ed - Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/25/i-support-trumps-vision-border-security-i-would-vote-against-emergency/?utm_term=.9667aeb69bad"><u>2/25/19</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Tillis: “I Can Understand Why The President Would Assert His Powers With The Emergency Declaration…If I Were The Leader Of The Constitution’s Article II Branch, I Would Probably Declare An Emergency And Use All The Tools At My Disposal As Well.” </strong>According to Washington Post, “From the perspective of the chief executive, I can understand why the president would assert his powers with the emergency declaration to implement his policy agenda. After all, nearly every president in the modern era has similarly pushed the boundaries of presidential power, many with the helping hand of Congress. In fact, if I were the leader of the Constitution’s Article II branch, I would probably declare an emergency and use all the tools at my disposal as well. But I am not. I am a member of the Senate, and I have grave concerns when our institution looks the other way at the expense of weakening Congress’s power.” [Sen.

<p><strong>Tillis Said Of Republicans Criticizing Obama When He Used Executive Action, But Failing To Oppose Trump’s Declaration: “There Is No Intellectual Honesty In Now Turning Around And Arguing That There’s An Imaginary Asterisk Attached To Executive Overreach – That It’s Acceptable For My Party But Not Thy Party.” </strong>According to a Washington Post op-ed by Senator Thom Tillis, “It is my responsibility to be a steward of the Article I branch, to preserve the separation of powers and to curb the kind of executive overreach that Congress has allowed to fester for the better part of the past century. I stood by that principle during the Obama administration, and I stand by it now. Conservatives rightfully cried foul when President Barack Obama used executive action to completely bypass Congress and unilaterally provide deferred action to undocumented adults who had knowingly violated the nation’s immigration laws. Some prominent Republicans went so far as to proclaim that Obama was acting more like an ‘emperor’ or ‘king’ than a president. There is no intellectual honesty in now turning around and arguing that there’s an imaginary asterisk attached to executive overreach — that it’s acceptable for my party but not thy party.” [Senator Thom Tillis Op-Ed - Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/25/i-support-trumps-vision-border-security-i-would-vote-against-emergency/?utm_term=.9667aeb69bad"><u>2/25/19</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Tillis Suggested It Would Be Hypocritical For Republicans To Support The Emergency Declaration After Criticizing President Barack Obama For “Executive Overreach” And Warned Future Democratic Presidents Would Follow Trump’s Precedent. </strong>According to Washington Post, “Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who faces a reelection race next year, suggested it would be hypocritical for Republicans to support the emergency declaration after criticizing President Barack Obama for ‘executive overreach.’ He warned that future Democratic presidents might follow Trump’s precedent. Tillis described a future ‘President Bernie Sanders declaring a national emergency to implement the radical Green New Deal’ or a ‘President Elizabeth Warren declaring a national emergency to shut down banks and take over the nation’s financial institutions.’ ‘I don’t believe in situational principles,’ he said.” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/16/trumps-declaration-national-emergency-faces-political-legal-challenges/?utm_term=.9a63d604d9aa"><u>2/16/19</u></a>]</li>

<h5><i>Tillis Expressed Support For Disapproval Legislation Of Trump’s Border Security National Emergency&nbsp;</i></h5>
<p><strong>Tillis Expressed Support For A Senate Version Of Legislation Disapproving Of President Trump’s Border Security National Emergency. </strong>According to Roll Call, “Sens. Susan Collins and Tom Udall have teamed up on the Senate version of legislation disapproving of President Trump’s border security national emergency. Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico and an appropriator, said the resolution to terminate the national emergency isn’t really even about the proposed border wall itself, saying on the Senate floor this is a matter of ‘standing up for the Constitution.’ […] In addition to Collins and Murkowski, Thom Tillis of North Carolina has expressed support. And more GOP supporters are expected, meaning the joint resolution should easily clear the Senate with a simple majority.” [Roll Call, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190311043824/https:/www.rollcall.com/news/congress/tom-udall-susan-collins-introduce-senate-disapproval-donald-trumps-border-security-emergency"><u>2/28/19</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Tillis Opposed Trump’s Plans To Sign A National Emergency Declaration, Saying “It Doesn’t Matter Who The President Is Or What Party They Belong To: I Strongly Believe In The Separation Of Powers And Curbing The Kind Of Executive Overreach That Congress Has Allowed To Fester For The Better Part Of The Last Century.” </strong>According to FOX 8, “Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) voiced his opposition after President Donald Trump announced his plans to sign a national emergency declaration Friday. President Donald Trump said Friday he will intends to sign a national emergency declaration to free up funds for a border wall and combat illegal immigration at the southern border. ‘It doesn’t matter who the President is or what party they belong to: I strongly believe in the separation of powers and curbing the kind of executive overreach that Congress has allowed to fester for the better part of the last century, including during the Obama Administration,’ Tillis said in a statement.” [FOX 8, <a href="https://myfox8.com/2019/02/15/nc-sen-thom-tillis-comes-out-against-president-trumps-national-emergency-declaration/"><u>2/15/19</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Tillis Defended His Decision To Vote For Disapproval Of Trump’s Emergency Declaration: “It’s Never A Tough Vote For Me When I’m Standing On Principle”</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Tillis Defended His Decision To Vote For Disapproval Of Trump’s Emergency Declaration, Saying He Had Been Consistent On The Issue Of Executive Power Since His 2014 Race When He Complained About Obama Legislating With A “Pen And Phone.” </strong>According to News &amp; Observer, “Tillis defended his decision, saying he has been consistent on the issue of executive power since his 2014 race when he complained about President Barack Obama legislating with a ‘pen and phone.’ Tillis also said he worries about the precedent Trump’s call might set for a future Democratic president. ‘This dates back to the concern that I had when I was campaigning in 2014,’ Tillis told reporters at the Capitol last week. ‘I agree with the need for about $25 billion to go down there. I just don’t think this is the right sustainable path, and I do believe Congress has to play a part in it.’ That nuanced position — one echoed by several prominent Republicans in the Senate, including Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — is up against Trump’s clear directive: Build the wall.” [News &amp; Observer, <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article227121824.html"><u>3/5/19</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Tillis Defended His Disapproval Of Trump’s Emergency Declaration, Saying Some People “Think Any Time You Take Exception To The Position The President May Have Taken, You’re Being Disloyal. I Don’t Believe That” And Noted “It’s Never A Tough Vote For Me When I’m Standing On Principle.” </strong>According to Washington Post, “The Trump administration privately appealed to Republican senators on Tuesday to stand with President Trump on his controversial wall, painting a picture of a U.S.-Mexico border crisis to persuade undecided GOP lawmakers to back his emergency declaration in a highly anticipated vote next week. […] ‘There are some people that think any time you take exception to the position the president may have taken, you’re being disloyal. I don’t believe that,’ Tillis said in an interview Tuesday. ‘I’ve had a great discussion with the White House in the past week or so. They understand that I know there’s a crisis at the border.’ Tillis added: ‘It’s never a tough vote for me when I’m standing on principle.’” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-seeks-gop-support-on-border-wall-as-senators-confront-hard-choices/2019/03/05/2d4e1b4a-3f81-11e9-9361-301ffb5bd5e6_story.html?utm_term=.fbf8caa2189e"><u>3/5/19</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>A Few Weeks After His Washington Post Column And Reports of A Possible Primary Challenge, Tillis Started To Waver And Suggested He Would Change His Mind On Voting For Disapproval</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Tillis Discussed Potential Changes To Legislation Curtailing Presidential Power With The White House, Saying He Discussed How To Balance The President’s “Individual Power” And Congress’ Role.” </strong>According to Politico, “Republican senators queasy about the legality and precedent of Trump’s unilateral move to fund his wall are exploring whether the president will commit to signing a bill amending the National Emergency Act and curtailing presidential power. […] Two GOP senators, Mike Lee of Utah and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, discussed the potential changes to the law with the White House over the weekend. Tillis opposes Trump’s national emergency declaration and Lee is undecided on how he will vote. Roughly a dozen GOP senators are weighing whether to vote against the White House. ‘There’s a lot of different discussions going on and really I thought the White House has been great in speaking with a number of members, me just one of them,’ Tillis said. He said they were discussing how to balance the president’s ‘individual power’ and Congress’ role.” [Politico, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/11/republicans-border-wall-trump-1216812"><u>3/11/19</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Tillis Was Set To Meet With Vice President Mike Pence To Decide The Extent Of The Republican Defections On A Vote To Reject Trump’s Emergency Declaration. </strong>According to Washington Post, “Vice President Pence will meet privately with three Republican senators later Tuesday who could decide the extent of Republican defections on a vote this week to reject President Trump’s national emergency declaration. The meeting, which was not listed on the vice president’s public schedule, will be held with Republican Sens. Thom Tillis (N.C.), Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) and Mike Lee (Utah) at the Capitol, according to two people familiar with it who were not authorized to speak publicly.” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pence-to-meet-with-gop-senators-as-white-house-seeks-to-limit-defections-on-trumps-emergency-declaration/2019/03/12/8f99eebc-44d3-11e9-9726-50f151ab44b9_story.html?utm_term=.a087ab9668d9"><u>3/12/19</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Tillis Had Said His Vote On Trump’s Emergency Declaration Would Depend On The Outcome Of The Talks With The White House On Mike Lee’s Bill Limiting The President’s Emergency Powers. </strong>According to The Hill, “Trump called Lee during a lunchtime meeting of the Senate Republican conference Wednesday to inform him that he would not support his bill to require Congress to vote to approve future national emergency declarations after 30 days. […] Tillis had engaged in the talks with Lee and Pence in hopes of finding a compromise that would allow him to change his mind and vote against the disapproval resolution. Tillis told The Hill Wednesday that his vote would depend on the outcome of the talks with the White House.” [The Hill, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/433931-lee-fifth-gop-senator-to-vote-against-trumps-border-declaration"><u>3/13/19</u></a>]</p>
<h5><i>Tillis Indicated He Could Change His Position On The Trump’s Emergency Declaration If The Trump Administration And Senators Struck A Deal On Limiting Executive Power</i></h5>
<p><strong>After Meeting With Pence, Tillis Indicated He Could Change His Position If The Administration And Senators Struck A Deal On Revising The National Emergencies Act.&nbsp; </strong>According to Washington Post, “The senators who met Tuesday with Pence were Tillis, Alexander, Lee, Rob Portman (Ohio) and Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.). All five of these lawmakers have indicated varying levels of concern with the president’s emergency declaration. […] Key to quelling the GOP revolt is legislation drafted by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) that tries to claw back some emergency powers to Congress and whether the White House endorses some version of it. […]&nbsp; Although four Republican senators have already announced they will vote to nullify the president’s emergency declaration, one of them — Sen. Thom Tillis (N.C.) — publicly indicated Tuesday after a private meeting with Vice President Pence that he could change his position if the administration and senators strike a deal on revising the National Emergencies Act. That would be enough to kill the resolution in the Senate, provided no other GOP senators oppose Trump’s declaration or alter their position.” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pence-to-meet-with-gop-senators-as-white-house-seeks-to-limit-defections-on-trumps-emergency-declaration/2019/03/12/8f99eebc-44d3-11e9-9726-50f151ab44b9_story.html?utm_term=.5015f65a57c7"><u>3/12/19</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>In A Private Luncheon After Meeting With Pence, Tillis Indicated He Was Flippable If The White House Agreed To Some Form Of Sen. Mike Lee’s Legislation, Which Would Give Back Some Emergency Powers To Congress. </strong>According to Washington Post, “Key to quelling the GOP revolt is legislation drafted by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) that tries to claw back some emergency powers to Congress and whether the White House endorses some version of it. […]&nbsp; Tillis — who Republican senators and aides broadly believe is flippable — told reporters after the meeting that the discussions with the administration remain a ‘work in progress.’ Inside a private luncheon with other Republican senators after the Pence gathering, Tillis made the case that if the White House agreed to some form of Lee’s legislation, that would mean a president would be giving up some of his executive powers — a rarity, according to a person briefed on the closed-door discussion.” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pence-to-meet-with-gop-senators-as-white-house-seeks-to-limit-defections-on-trumps-emergency-declaration/2019/03/12/8f99eebc-44d3-11e9-9726-50f151ab44b9_story.html?utm_term=.5015f65a57c7"><u>3/12/19</u></a>]</p>

<p><strong>Tillis Voted To Support Trump’s Emergency Declaration, Announcing His Change Of Heart Minutes Before The Senate Vote: “A Lot Has Changed Over The Last Three Weeks.” </strong>According to Associated Press, “Changing his vote from the public stance he took last month, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis voted Thursday to support President Donald Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to pay for his border wall.

<h3><strong>Tillis Said He Wanted To Protect Healthcare Coverage For People With Pre-Existing, But Supported Legislation That Would Remove Those Protections</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Tillis Believed A Health Care Plan Needed To Addressing Pre-Existing Conditions</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Tillis Believed A Health Care Plan Needed To Address Pre-Existing Conditions And Ensure Young Americans Could Stay On Their Parents’ Insurance. </strong>According to Salisbury Post, “U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., says the final health care plan passed by Congress must address pre-existing conditions and ensure young Americans can stay on their parents’ insurance. Tillis made the statement in a tweet on Friday -- one day after the U.S. House passed the American Health Care Act by a 217-213 count. The health care bill now heads to the Senate, where it’s expected to see a tougher road to passage.” [Salisbury Post, 5/6/17]</p>
<p><strong>Tillis Accused Democrats Of Spreading A “False Narrative” In Saying That Republicans Were Going To Take Away Protections For Pre-Existing Conditions. </strong>According to Washington Post, “Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who himself sponsored a bill that he said would provide these protections in August (more on that bill here, and here, and here), accused Democrats of spreading a ‘false narrative.’ ‘It’s a false narrative for Democrats to come in and say if you elect Republicans we’re going to take that away. We’re doing everything we can, including myself... to make sure we protect preexisting conditions,’ Tillis said in an interview on ‘Fox News Sunday.’ […] However, as my colleague Elise writes, claims from Tillis, the president and many Republicans that they have protected Americans with preexisting medical conditions is a ‘false claim that flies in the face of the reality of the past eight years.’” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2018/11/05/the-health-202-four-of-the-health-care-issues-at-stake-in-the-midterm-elections/5bdf53371b326b39290545bc/"><u>11/5/18</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Tillis Voted Repeatedly To Limit Protections For People With Pre-Existing Conditions</u></strong></h4>
<h5><i>Voted Against Making It Harder To Consider Legislation That Would Limit Insurance Access For People With Pre-Existing Conditions</i></h5>
<p><strong>2017: Tillis Effectively Voted Against Requiring 60 Votes To Consider Legislation That Would Limit Health Insurance Access For Individuals With A Pre-Existing Condition.</strong> In January 2017, Tillis voted against waiving a point of order against an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, “ban[ed] legislation from being considered in the Senate that would limit, reduce, or eliminate access to care for anyone with a pre-existing condition, place a lifetime or annual cap on health insurance coverage for someone with a disability or chronic condition, or that would allow a health plan to discriminate based on health. The ban would be waived by a three-fifths vote of the Senate.” The underlying legislation was an FY 2017 budget resolution designed to being the process of repealing the Affordable Care Act, which could be passed by a majority vote. The vote was on a motion to waive the budget act in relation to the amendment. The vote required a three-fifths vote for approval. The Senate rejected the motion by a vote of 49 to 49.

<p><strong>2017: Tillis Voted For The So Called “Skinny Repeal” Version Of Trumpcare Which Among Other Things, Repealed The Individual Mandate, Repealed The Employer Mandate Through 2024 And Defunded Planned Parenthood For One Year.</strong> In July 2017, Tillis voted for the Health Care Freedom Act, also known as “skinny repeal.” According to Congressional Quarterly, the amendment would have “repeal[ed] the individual mandate, repeal[ed] the employer mandate through 2024, delay[ed] the implementation of the medical device tax through 2020, and block[ed], for one year, federal funding from going to certain medical providers that provide abortions. The amendment would [have] ease[d] the waiver process for states to opt out of the requirement that their health insurance providers include certain benefits on their health care plans. Additionally, the amendment would [have] increase[d] the maximum allowable contribution to health savings accounts and would defund the Prevention and Public Health Fund starting in 2019.” The vote was on the amendment.

  <li><strong>“Skinny Repeal” Would Permit Waivers Allowing States To Change Regulations Of Pre-Existing Conditions Coverage. According to CNN, “Provide greater flexibility to the states through waivers: Obamacare changed the way insurers do business, banning them from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions and requiring them to cover 10 essential health benefits, including maternity and mental health. These regulations pushed up the cost of coverage. The ‘skinny repeal’ bill would give states more flexibility in implementing some of these regulations, including the essential health benefits and the out-of-pocket spending limit. Just what that would mean for consumers is a little unclear. States must make sure their waivers don’t cause people to become uninsured, benefits to be curtailed or coverage to be less affordable. But the waivers last eight years and once granted, the federal government can’t terminate them -- even if they have a negative impact on state residents.” [CNN, </strong><a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/07/27/news/economy/senate-skinny-repeal-health-care/index.html"><strong><u>7/28/17</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
