<h3><strong>Tillis Supported Repealing The Affordable Care Act&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Tillis Opposed The Affordable Care Act&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Tillis Lamented That He Wasn’t Able To Help Repeal Obamacare. </strong>“Tillis said, ‘I mean, just take a look at it. When President Trump came out in 2017, we tried to move quickly on reversing the damage that Obamacare was creating. We came up a vote short.’” [Fox News Sunday, 12/16/24]; 241215_BGO_4292_A</p>
<h4><strong><u>Voted 20 Times To Repeal, In Whole Or In Part, The Affordable Care Act</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2018: Tillis Effectively Voted To Prohibit Washington, D.C. From Enforcing Its Own Individual Mandate Health Insurance Requirements.</strong> In August 2018, Tillis effectively voted for an amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, “prohibit[ed] the District of Columbia from using funds appropriated by the bill to enforce certain health insurance requirements.” The underlying bill was an FY 2019 Appropriations bill for Interior, Environment, Financial Services, Agriculture, Transportation, and HUD. The vote was on a motion to table the amendment. The Senate agreed to the motion, thereby effectively killing the amendment, by a vote of 54 to 44.

<p><strong>2018: Tillis Voted For A February 2018 Two-Year Budget Deal Which, Among Other Things, Increased Spending By $300 Billion, Suspended The Debt Ceiling, Reauthorized Community Health Centers For Two Years And Repealed The Independent Payment Advisory Board.</strong> In February 2018, Tillis voted for a two-year budget deal that re-opened the government after a brief shutdown. According to the New York Times, “With Mr. Trump’s signature, the government will reopen before many Americans were aware it had closed, with a deal that includes about $300 billion in additional funds over two years for military and nonmilitary programs, almost $90 billion in disaster relief in response to last year’s hurricanes and wildfires, and a higher statutory debt ceiling.” In addition, according to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation “would provide funding for federal government operations and services at current levels through March 23, 2018 […] [and] retroactively extends numerous tax breaks that expired at the end of 2016. It also extends the CHIP program for another four years (through FY 2027) and funds community health centers for another two years.” The vote was on a motion concur in the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment with an Amendment. The Senate agreed to the motion by a vote of 71 to 28, essentially passing the bill. The House later passed the legislation. President Trump later signed the bill into law.

  <li><strong>Legislation Repealed IPAB, Which Was Created By The ACA. According to Congressional Quarterly, “The agreement repeals the provisions of the 2010 health care law that created IPAB and it restores previous law to maintain the current Medicare spending review process, under which MedPAC makes non-binding recommendations. CBO estimates that repealing IPAB would increase direct spending by $17.5 billion over 10 years.” [Congressional Quarterly, </strong><a href="http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5262332?3"><strong><u>2/9/18</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>

<p><strong>2017: Tillis Voted For The Final Version Of Trump’s Tax Reform Plan, Which Substantially Cut Taxes For Rich Americans And Corporations, And Repealed The Individual Mandate.</strong> In December 2017, Tillis voted for the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, also known as Trump’s tax reform bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, “This Conference Summary deals with the conference report on HR 1, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the House will consider Tuesday. The agreement significantly cuts corporate and individual taxes and seeks to simply the tax code, although most individual tax provisions would expire after 2025. It reduces the corporate tax from 35% to 21% and reduces taxation of so-called ‘pass-through’ businesses where profits are taxed at the individual rate. For corporate taxes it also establishes a ‘territorial’ tax system that exempts most overseas income from U.S. taxation. Most individual tax rate rates would be reduced, including by dropping the top rate from 39.6% to 37%, and it eliminates personal exemptions but nearly doubles the standard deduction so fewer taxpayers will itemize deductions.” The vote was on a motion to recede from the Senate version of the bill and agree concur with a further amendment, essentially on passage. The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 51 to 48. The House later agreed to the modified version of the bill. President Trump signed the bill into law.

  <li><strong>Bill Would Repeal The Individual Mandate. According to the Congressional Budget Office, “Repealing the Individual Mandate.

  <li><strong>13 Million Fewer Americans Would Have Health Insurance As A Result Of Repealing The Individual Mandate. According to the Congressional Budget Office, “Repealing the Individual Mandate. The bill’s most significant effects on outlays would occur as a result of the elimination, beginning in 2019, of the penalties associated with the individual mandate.

  <li><strong>Premiums Would Increase By About 10 Percent. According to the Congressional Budget Office, “Average premiums in the nongroup market would increase by about 10 percent in most years of the decade (with no changes in the ages of people purchasing insurance accounted for) relative to CBO’s baseline projections. In other words, premiums in both 2019 and 2027 would be about 10 percent higher than is projected in the baseline.” [Congressional Budget Office, </strong><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/reconciliationrecommendationssfc.pdf"><strong><u>11/26/17</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>In 2027, 83 Percent Of The Total Tax Benefit Would Go To The Top One Percent. According to Tax Policy Center, “n 2027, the overall average tax cut would be $160, or 0.2 percent of after-tax income (table 3), largely because almost all individual income tax provisions would sunset after 2025. On average, taxes would be little changed for taxpayers in the bottom 95 percent of the income distribution. Taxpayers in the bottom two quintiles of the income distribution would face an average tax increase of 0.1 percent of after-tax income; taxpayers in the middle income quintile would see no material change on average; and taxpayers in the 95th to 99th income percentiles would receive an average tax cut of 0.2 percent of after-tax income. Taxpayers in the top 1 percent of the income distribution would receive an average tax cut of 0.9 percent of after-tax income, accounting for 83 percent of the total benefit for that year.” [Tax Policy Center, </strong><a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/publication/150816/2001641_distributional_analysis_of_the_conference_agreement_for_the_tax_cuts_and_jobs_act.pdf"><strong><u>12/18/17</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>In 2027, 86 Million Americans Would See A Tax Increase. According to ABC News, “The bill, which carries an estimated $1.5 trillion price tag over 10 years, is not expected to win any Democratic support. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi points to a new analysis from the non-partisan Tax Policy Center that predicts 86 million people would see a tax increase compared to current law by 2027, while 83 percent of the anticipated benefits would be reaped by the wealthiest one percent of taxpayers.” [ABC News, </strong><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-expected-pass-tax-reform-measure/story?id=51870650"><strong><u>12/19/17</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>

According to Congressional Quarterly, “Passage of the bill, as amended, that would revise the federal income tax system by lowering individual and corporate tax rates, repealing various deductions through 2025, specifically by eliminating the deduction for state and local income taxes through 2025, increasing the deduction for pass-through entities and raising the child tax credit through 2025.

  <li><strong>Vox: “‘Skinny” Repeal Isn’t Skinny At All.” According to Vox, “‘Skinny’ repeal isn’t skinny at all. […] Here’s why: Skinny repeal isn’t really that skinny at all.

  <li><strong>The BCRA Would Result In 22 Million Additional Uninsured Americans. According to the Washington Post, “The CBO also says that the most recent version would cause a slightly slower erosion of health coverage — with 15 million fewer Americans predicted to be insured in 2018, compared with current law. That would be 2 million fewer losing insurance next year than under an earlier form of the legislation. As of 2026, however, the predicted 22 million increase in the ranks of the uninsured would be the same as under the bill’s previous version, the CBO says.” [Washington Post, </strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/revised-version-of-withdrawn-health-care-bill-would-still-leave-22-million-more-americans-uninsured-cbo-says/2017/07/20/815a3524-6d6f-11e7-96ab-5f38140b38cc_story.html?utm_term=.5ec712753862"><strong><u>7/20/17</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>BCRA Could Cause Deductibles To Rise To More Than $13,000 Per Year. According to CNBC, “Under the Senate's proposed health plan, the Better Care Reconciliation Act, deductibles will rise to new heights, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Deductibles are the amount you as a consumer must pay each year before your health insurance coverage kicks in for services you receive beyond a certain minimum set of medical services. And they're far more common than they used to be. Nowadays half of Americans have health insurance that comes with a deductible of at least $1,000. That’s steep. But should the Senate repeal the Affordable Care Act and pass its replacement plan, the CBO warns that, by 2026, or only nine years from now, your deductible, if you buy health coverage on the individual insurance plan market, could reach $13,000 a year — or more.” [CNBC, </strong><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/25/cbo-deductibles-under-the-senates-better-care-plan-could-be-13000.html"><strong><u>7/25/17</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The $13,000 Deductible Would Exceed The Incomes Of Some Americans. According to the CBO, “Because a deductible of $13,000 would be a large share of their income, many people with low income would not purchase any plan even if it had very low premiums—on net, after accounting for premium tax credits — CBO and JCT estimate. Under this legislation, in 2026, that deductible would exceed the annual income of $11,400 for someone with income at 75 percent of the FPL. For people whose income was at 175 percent of the FPL ($26,500) and 375 percent of the FPL ($56,800), the deductible would constitute about a half and a quarter of their income, respectively.” [CBO, </strong><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/52941-hr1628bcra.pdf"><strong><u>7/20/17</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>

<p><strong>2017: Tillis Effectively Voted For The GOP FY 2018 Budget Resolution, Which Started The Process Towards Tax Reform And Called For Cutting Medicare By $473 Billion.</strong> In October 2017, Tillis effectively voted for a budget resolution that would have, according to The Hill, “The spending blueprint is key to Republicans’ efforts to pass tax reform because it includes instructions that will allow the plan to avoid a Democratic filibuster. […] The budget, meant to outline spending for the fiscal year, was widely viewed as a mere vehicle for passing tax reform. […] The budget would allow the Senate GOP’s tax plan to add up to $1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade, a proposal that has raised concerns with fiscal hawks in the GOP. Its instructions call for the Senate Finance Committee to report a tax bill by Nov. 13. Still, the document outlines the Senate GOP’s political vision. It maintains spending at 2017 levels for the year, but would then cut nondefense spending in subsequent years, leading to a $106 billion cut in 2027. It would also allow defense levels to continue rising at their current rates, reaching $684 billion at the end of a decade. The resolution also proposes $473 billion in cuts to Medicare’s baseline spending over a decade and about $1 trillion from Medicaid, though those provisions are not enforceable without additional legislation.” The vote was on a motion to invoke cloture on the House GOP budget resolution, setting up a vote on the Senate’s budget resolution. The Senate agreed to the motion by a vote of 50 to 47 The House and the Senate later passed a slightly different version of the budget resolution.
