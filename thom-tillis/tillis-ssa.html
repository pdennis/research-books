<h2><strong>Tillis Was Weak On Defending Social Security&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<h4><strong><u>Tillis Suggested Cutting Entitlement Programs&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Tillis Claimed That Tax Reform Had To Be Funded Through “Opening Up Entitlements” And Bending The Curve On Spending On Entitlements. </strong>“The other thing that we have to do is potentially fund tax reform through opening up entitlements, fixing entitlements, and bending the curve on spending on entitlements. You can’t restructure your way out of an $18 or $19 trillion debt by only dealing with 20 percent of the spending, and we have to have people that are courageous enough to do it.” [Ripon Society, <a href="https://youtu.be/kf6xICEz6mE?si=qcGGBIL-kr-SsdTJ"><u>6/16/16</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Tillis Voted Against A Bill That Restore Social Security Benefits To Public Sectors Employees&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>The “Social Security Fairness Act” Rescinded Statutes That Have Decreased Benefits For Public Sector Employees. </strong>According to the Hill, “Twenty GOP senators voted against legislation approved by the Senate late Friday that would bolster Social Security benefits for more than 2 million American citizens working in a range of occupations. The legislation, dubbed the Social Security Fairness Act, will rescind two statutes that have decreased benefits to an array of individuals working as teachers, firefighters, local and state police and others within the public sector.” [Hill, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5052213-social-security-benefits-bill-repeal/"><u>12/21/24</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Tillis Voted Against The Bill. </strong>According to the Hill, “There are the 20 Senators who voted against the Social Security bill. […] Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.)” [Hill, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5052213-social-security-benefits-bill-repeal/"><u>12/21/24</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] Tillis Claimed That He Told Trump That The “Social Security Fairness Act” Was “An Awful Bill.” </strong>“Oh, the Social Security bill? I told President Trump yesterday, we were on a call together, I said t's an awful bill. Uh, and I voted against it. I spoke against it. I didn't want to be silent. There's no way we should be voting on that. So, if they're one of your listeners, Answer this question for me, why on earth would I vote for a bill that raids the social security trust fund of 200 billion over the next 10 years and brings forward insolvency by 6 months over a 9 year period? Folks, there's a right way to do it and there's a wrong way to do it and that's a wrong way to do it and if people think I'm going to be pressured into a sympathetic vote for bad policy, they don't know Thom Tillis.” [Raeford Brown Show, 12/19/2024]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Tillis Supported Raising The Retirement Age&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] Tillis Supported Raising The Retirement Age. </strong>“TILLIS: How old are you? HOST: 35 Tillis: Alright, you’re 35 so if we are going to do social security and Medicare to make sure it’s there when you get eligible we may have to tell you and your generation that you may have to wait 6 or 8 months longer to get it.” [Tyler Cralle Show, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tylercralle/senator-thom-tillis-12"><u>2/8/18</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Tillis Told Bisignano Not To “Pull Any Punches” On Decisions About Closing Social Security Offices&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Tillis Told Bisignano Not To “Pull Any Punches” On Decisions About Closing Social Security Offices. </strong>According to the New Hampshire Bulletin, “North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis urged Bisignano not to ‘pull any punches’ on decisions about closing field offices. ‘What you’re going to find out is, after you do the analytics, every member of Congress, except for me probably, will like your analytics, except to the extent that it affects one of their offices and their district or state,’ Tillis said.” [New Hampshire Bulletin, <a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2025/03/25/repub/social-security-nominee-vows-service-will-improve-despite-mass-firings-office-closures/"><u>3/25/25</u></a>]</p>
