<p><strong>[VIDEO] Tillis Claimed That Republicans Would Use Reconciliation To Extend Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts. </strong>“You know, if Republicans sweep D.C., then we will use reconciliation to extend most of what was in the Jobs and Tax Cuts Act. We've got to figure out pay fors and all that stuff. But in many respects, we're just trying to make the best of a bad situation. It would be great if we could do true, you know, big our tax reform that involved broadening the base, lowering the rate, getting rid of irrational exemptions, exceptions and exemptions like we did in the state and then have a triggering mechanism that's forward looking.” [Punchbowl News, <a href="https://youtu.be/LFyAolEDTfc?si=cPKn2hivc8PcrQsE"><u>10/16/24</u></a>]; 241016_BF_3376_A</p>

  <li><strong>[AUDIO] Tillis Claimed That Tax Cuts Would Be Paid For By Repealing Provisions From The American Rescue Plan And Inflation Reduction Act. </strong>“And we need to be careful to not increase tax burdens. We need to we need to try and extend. I mean, it's it's got to be tough to pay for a lot of what we put in in place in 2017. So we're going to have to make some tough choices.We say about three or $400 billion, not on what we'd like to do for the guilty tax corrections. That right, Ryan. And we've got a lot of headwinds there. So it's probably going to be something short of that. And are we going to be able to get support if we're in divided government, it's going to take a 60 vote threshold, right? I mean, I for one think there are some tax provisions that we should go ahead and try to do. Let's say we run the table. I still think that we should try and build a case for some of the tax provisions to go to the 60 vote threshold. Why not? So that they could have some permanency and we can set them aside and then only use reconciliation for the things where we disagree. I think that you could if we run the table, we can use the threat of reconciliation to say we can go here or we can go there. Do you want to come to the table and work with us? And we should be thinking that way so that we don't necessarily have to do everything with reconciliation. And when we do reconciliation, we've got to, as I said, we've got to find pay for this. And undoubtedly a lot of those pay fors are going to come from repeal of various provisions and the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. I mean, there's a lot of spending there that doesn't have a nexus with tax relief. And it sounds like those would be some of the buckets we have to go into.” [American investment Council, North Carolina, 10/17/24]; 241017_HMF_2658</li>

<p><strong>[AUDIO] Tillis Supported Reauthorizing Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts. </strong>“Well, Beth, I think we have to go fulfill the promise of reauthorizing the the majority of the tax cuts that we implemented in 2017. I honestly believe that that was a big factor in President Trump's when we could not have the $3 trillion tax increase that Harris was promising. Don't think it was one of our better winning themes, but we've got to go back and fulfill that one.” [Good Morning BT, 11/06/24]; 241106_EGJ_1534</p>

<h5><i>Tillis Joined A Letter Calling For Making Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts Permanent&nbsp;</i></h5>
<p><strong>Tillis Signed The Letter. </strong>According to Politico, “The letter was led by Sen. Steve Daines (Mont.) and also signed by Sens. John Barrasso (Wyo.), James Lankford (Okla.), Thom Tillis (N.C.), Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.), Ron Johnson (Wisc.) and Roger Marshall (Kan.)” [Politico, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/13/congress/senate-republicans-short-term-extension-tax-cuts-00204065"><u>2/13/25</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>The Letter Claimed That The Senators Would Not Support A Tax Package That Only Temporarily Extends The 2017 Tax Cuts. </strong>According to Politico, “‘We will not support a tax package that only provides temporary relief from tax hikes.’ Their demand for permanency actually goes beyond what Republicans did back in 2017 when they made much of their breaks benefiting individual Americans expire after eight years, a move that was designed to contain costs — but that is now forcing this year’s debate over the future of those provisions.” [Politico, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/13/congress/senate-republicans-short-term-extension-tax-cuts-00204065"><u>2/13/25</u></a>]</p>
