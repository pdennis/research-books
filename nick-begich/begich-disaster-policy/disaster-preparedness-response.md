# Disaster Preparedness and Response Strategy

### Summary

-   Publicly rejecting a decade-long timeline for flood protection may raise expectations for swifter results that are difficult to deliver, potentially leading to future political fallout if solutions are delayed ([Juneau Empire](https://www.juneauempire.com/news/begich-supports-trumps-federal-cutbacks-but-i-recognize-the-process-wont-be-perfect/), 2/20/25).

-   Emphasizing the need to cut regulatory "red tape" for faster flood solutions can be controversial, possibly sparking concerns about oversight, safety, and environmental impacts ([Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5X-CM23-RRV8-J12D-00000-00&context=1519360), 2/20/25).

-   Admitting familiarity with longstanding regulatory hurdles but focusing on regulatory relief could be perceived as oversimplifying complex land use and permitting issues ([Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DB2-48R1-F0HF-80K7-00000-00&context=1519360), 11/1/24).

-   Promoting quick fixes through regulatory shortcuts may invite criticism from environmental groups and agencies responsible for public safety or conservation ([Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5X-CM23-RRV8-J12D-00000-00&context=1519360), 2/20/25).

-   Scheduling meetings with citizens and officials to assess local flood proposals indicates engagement but also highlights that concrete solutions remain undecided, potentially exposing gaps in strategy or preparedness ([Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5X-CM23-RRV8-J12D-00000-00&context=1519360), 2/20/25).

### Regulatory and Policy Approaches

#### Call for Regulatory Relief in Emergencies

**February 2025: Begich Called A Decade-Long Timeline For Mendenhall Flood Solution Unacceptable And Supported Cutting Regulations For Quicker Results** According to Juneau Empire, 'Among the things Begich said Thursday he is targeting is a declaration by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers experts that it will take five to ten years to develop a permanent solution to protect Mendenhall Valley homes from annual glacial outburst floods. "No, that is not acceptable," he said of the timeline, adding "I think that we do have an administration that has decided that they're not going to adhere to too much red tape. So in this instance that could be very helpful for moving things quickly."' \[Juneau Empire, [2/20/25](https://www.juneauempire.com/news/begich-supports-trumps-federal-cutbacks-but-i-recognize-the-process-wont-be-perfect/)\]

**2024: Begich Expressed Familiarity With Regulatory Issues Concerning Suicide Basin Flooding** According to Juneau Empire, "Begich, during his campaign visit, said he's familiar with protective measures being discussed such as a levee but notes 'there's a lot of regulatory red tape' in implementing many of the potential long-range measures since the basin is on U.S. Forest Service land." \[Juneau Empire (Alaska), [11/1/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DB2-48R1-F0HF-80K7-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2025: Begich Expressed Openness To Regulatory Relief For Faster Flood Solutions** According to Juneau Empire, "I think that we do have an administration that has decided that they're not going to adhere to too much red tape. So in this instance that could be very helpful for moving things quickly." \[Juneau Empire (Alaska), [2/20/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5X-CM23-RRV8-J12D-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Infrastructure and Resource Allocation

#### Federal Spending for Disaster Readiness

**February 2025: Nick Begich Addressed Alaska's Infrastructure And Air Safety Needs** According to Homer News, 'Begich said it's important to invest in Alaska's infrastructure, such as redundant power conductivity systems and cameras in remote locations. He also said staffing levels need to be appropriate and that they are trained with adequate resources.' \[Homer News (Alaska), [2/19/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5J-2R23-SCRM-848X-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

#### Approach to Flood Solutions and Infrastructure

**2025: Begich Deemed Glacial Flood Protection Timeline Unacceptable In Juneau** According to Juneau Empire, "Among the things Begich said Thursday he is targeting is a declaration by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers experts that it will take five to ten years to develop a permanent solution to protect Mendenhall Valley homes from annual glacial outburst floods. 'No, that is not acceptable,' he said of the timeline." \[Juneau Empire (Alaska), [2/20/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5X-CM23-RRV8-J12D-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Community Engagement and Support

#### Constituent Services During Disasters

**2025: Begich Scheduled Meetings With Citizens And Officials To Assess Local Flood Mitigation Proposals** According to Juneau Empire, "Begich, when asked after his speeches if he was aware of such warnings and the specifics involved in the timeline he calls unacceptable, said his meetings with the citizens' group as well as local leaders will help him determine which solutions 'may or may not be sufficient.'" \[Juneau Empire (Alaska), [2/20/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5X-CM23-RRV8-J12D-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
