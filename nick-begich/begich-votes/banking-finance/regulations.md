### Digital Assets

**2025: Begich Voted To Disapprove An IRS Rule That Established Reporting Requirements For Digital Asset Proceeds.** In March 205, Begich voted for , "the bill that would provide for Congressional disapproval of, and nullify, a December 2024 IRS rule related to gross proceeds reporting by brokers involved in digital asset sales. The rule imposed reporting requirements, beginning in 2027, on non-custodial barkers who participate in the decentralized digital asset market. It also required brokers to file information returns and provide payee statements reporting gross proceeds from certain digital asset sales and transactions." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 292 to 132. \[House Vote 71, [[3/11/25]{.underline}](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll071.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [[3/11/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/71?4); Congressional Actions, [[H.J.
