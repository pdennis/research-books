### Cancellation Of Tariffs

**2025: Begich Voted To Disapprove An IRS Rule That Established Reporting Requirements For Digital Asset Proceeds.** In March 205, Begich voted for , "the bill that would provide for Congressional disapproval of, and nullify, a December 2024 IRS rule related to gross proceeds reporting by brokers involved in digital asset sales. The rule imposed reporting requirements, beginning in 2027, on non-custodial barkers who participate in the decentralized digital asset market. It also required brokers to file information returns and provide payee statements reporting gross proceeds from certain digital asset sales and transactions." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 292 to 132. \[House Vote 71, [[3/11/25]{.underline}](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll071.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [[3/11/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/71?4); Congressional Actions, [[H.J. Res. 25]{.underline}](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-joint-resolution/25/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Effectively Blocked The House From Voting To Reverse Trump's Tariffs On Mexico, Canada, And China For The Next Year.** According to the New York Times, "Republican leaders on Tuesday slipped language into a procedural measure that would prevent any resolution to end the tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China from receiving a vote this year. It passed on party lines as part of a resolution that cleared the way for a vote later Tuesday on a government spending bill needed to prevent a shutdown at the end of the week." \[New York Times, [[3/11/25]{.underline}](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]

-   **The Bill Nullified A Law That Would Allow The House And Senate To End A Disaster Declared By The President.** According to the New York Times, "In this case, Republican leaders did so using a particularly unusual contortion: They essentially declared the rest of the year one long day, nullifying a law that allows the House and Senate to jointly put an end to a disaster declared by the president." \[New York Times, [[3/11/25]{.underline}](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]

-   **Democrats Previously Planned To Force Votes On The Tariffs Under The National Emergencies Act.** According to the New York Times, "House Democrats had planned to force a vote on resolutions to end the tariffs on Mexico and Canada, a move allowed under the National Emergencies Act, which provides a mechanism for Congress to terminate an emergency like the one Mr. Trump declared when he imposed the tariffs on Feb. 1. That would have forced Republicans --- many of whom are opposed to tariffs as a matter of principle --- to go on the record on the issue at a time when Mr. Trump's commitment to tariffs has spooked the financial markets and spiked concerns of reigniting inflation." \[New York Times, [[3/11/25]{.underline}](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]

-   **The National Emergencies Act Required Consideration Of Resolutions Ending A Presidentially Declared Emergency Within Fifteen Calendar Days But Republican Leadership Included A Measure In The Bill Delcaring The Rest Of The Year Did Not Constitute A Calendar Day.** According to the New York Times, "The national emergency law lays out a fast-track process for Congress to consider a resolution ending a presidential emergency, requiring committee consideration within 15 calendar days after one is introduced and a floor vote within three days after that. But the language House Republicans inserted in their measure on Tuesday declared that, 'Each day for the remainder of the 119th Congress shall not constitute a calendar day' for the purposes of the emergency that Mr. Trump declared on Feb. 1." \[New York Times, [[3/11/25]{.underline}](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]
