# Israel-Hamas War

### International Criminal Court

**2025: Begich Voted To Sanction The International Criminal Court For Indicting Israel.** In January 2025, Begich voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would require the president to impose U.S. property blocking and visa sanctions on International Criminal Court officials and others involved with bringing indictments against certain \"protected\" persons, including Israeli and U.S. officials. Under the measure, sanctions could include the denial or revocation of visas to enter the U.S., asset freezes on property in the U.S., and restrictions on transactions in financial, securities and currency markets. Protected individuals would include U.S. persons (explicitly including current or former members of the U.S. military and elected or appointed U.S. officials) unless the U.S. provides formal consent to ICC jurisdiction over genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. Citizens or lawful residents of U.S. allies who have not consented to ICC jurisdiction (such as Israeli officials) also would be considered protected individuals. It also would rescind funds appropriated and made available for the ICC, effective on the date of the bill's enactment. It also would prohibit future appropriations to the ICC." The House passed the bill by a vote of 243 to 140. \[House Vote 7, [[1/9/25]{.underline}](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll007.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [[1/9/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/7?4); Congressional Actions, [[H.R. 23]{.underline}](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/23/all-actions)\]
