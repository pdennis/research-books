### Address Rapid Ohi'a Death

**2025: Begich Voted To Combat The Rapid Ohi'a Death Disease Impacting Ohi'a Trees In Hawaii.** In January 2025, Begich voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would require the Interior Department to partner and collaborate with the Agriculture Department and the state of Hawaii to address and support sustained efforts to combat the \"Rapid Ohi\'a Death\" fungal disease affecting the state's Ohi\'a tree population. The Interior Department also would be required to continue collaborative research on disease vectors and transmission, and to partner with federal, state and local stakeholders to manage certain large animals in ROD control areas. The Agriculture Department would be required to provide financial and staff support to prevent the spread of the disease." The House passed the bill by a vote of 359 to 62. \[House Vote 24, [[1/23/25]{.underline}](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll024.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [[1/23/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/24?4); Congressional Actions, [[H.R. 375]{.underline}](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/375/all-actions)\]
