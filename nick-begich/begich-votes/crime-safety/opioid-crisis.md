# Heroin And Opioid Crisis

### Fentanyl Classification

**2025: Begich Voted To Permanently Classify All Fentanyl-Related Substances As Schedule I Controlled Substances.** In February 2025, Begich voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would permanently classify all fentanyl-related substances as Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act, unless they are specifically exempted or listed in another schedule. It also would establish new expedited registration procedures for the use of controlled substances in research, including Schedule I and II drugs. The measure would define a fentanyl-related substance as one that contains salts, isomers and salts of isomers of fentanyl with a specific chemical designation. It would allow the attorney general to publish a list of fentanyl-related substances, though a drug not included in the list could still be restricted as a Schedule I drug if it meets the bill's chemical definition. The measure also would extend to those drugs the mandatory minimum sentencing requirements under current law for certain illegal substances." The House passed the bill by a vote of 312 to 108. \[House Vote 33, [[2/6/25]{.underline}](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll033.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [[2/6/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/33?4); Congressional Actions, [[H.R. 27]{.underline}](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/27/all-actions)\]

-   **Some Democrats Opposed The Bill Out Of Concern For Increased Mass Incarceration.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "While the bill was bipartisan, some Democrats expressed dismay that it could result in more mass incarcerations." \[Congressional Quarterly, [[3/14/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8199191?2)\]
