### Prohibiting Transgender Women In Sports

**2025: Begich Voted To Ban Transgender Women From Participating In Sports Funded By Title IX.** In January 2025, according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would effectively ban transgender women and girls from competing on women\'s athletic teams that receive federal funds. It would specifically amend existing prohibitions on sex discrimination in federally funded (Title IX) educational programs to also prohibit such programs from allowing persons 'whose sex is male' to participate in athletic programs designed for girls or women. It would specify that, for the purposes of the bill, a sex is 'based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth.' The bill would allow Title IX programs to permit males to train or practice with an athletic program designed for girls or women as long as no female is deprived of any benefit of participation, such as a place on a team, scholarship or the ability to participate in a practice or competition." The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 206. \[House Vote 12, [[1/14/25]{.underline}](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll012.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [[1/14/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/14?4); Congressional Actions, [[H.R. 28]{.underline}](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/28/all-actions)\]
