It would generally prohibit institutions of higher education from entering into contracts with foreign countries of concern or foreign entities of concern. It would require institutions to disclose any gifts they receive from such countries or entities. It also would require private institutions to disclose whether their endowments are invested in assets issued by foreign countries or entities of concern, and it would establish new penalties for institutions that violate the bill\'s requirements.
