### Customs And Border Patrol

**2025: Begich Voted To Establish Penalties For Evasion Of Border Patrol While Operating A Motor Vehicle.** In February 2025, Begich voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would establish penalties for an individual who commits a criminal offense by operating a motor vehicle within 100 miles of the U.S. border while intentionally avoiding a U.S. Border Patrol agent or any federal, state or local enforcement officer who is assisting U.S. Border Patrol. Penalties would include a maximum two-year imprisonment term or monetary fines or both. The imprisonment term would increase in the case of serious bodily injury or death, including a mandatory minimum sentence. It would direct the attorney general, in conjunction with the secretary of Homeland Security, to submit an annual report to the congressional judiciary committees on the number of people charged under the bill as well as those apprehended but not charged and those who committed a violation but were not apprehended along with the penalties sought and imposed for each violation." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 264 to 155. \[House Vote 42, [[2/13/25]{.underline}](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll042.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [[2/13/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/42?4); Congressional Actions, [[H.R. 35]{.underline}](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/35/all-actions)\]
