# Deportation

### Criminal Offenses

**2025: Begich Voted For The Laken Riley Act Which Required Deportation Of Undocumented Immigrants Arrested For Theft And Related Criminal Offenses.** In January 2025, Begich voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish grounds for inadmissibility (and thus deportation) of immigrants who have been charged with theft and other criminal offenses, including misdemeanors. It also would include assaulting law enforcement officers and harming others on the list of violations for which an immigrant could be deported. The measure also would allow states to sue the federal government for certain failures to enforce immigration rules or law." The House passed the bill by a vote of 263 to 156. \[House Vote 23, [[1/22/25]{.underline}](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll023.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [[1/22/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/23?4); Congressional Actions, [[S. 5]{.underline}](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/5/all-actions)\]

-   **Under The Bill, A Detainer Would Be Issued For Undocumented Immigrants Arrested For Burglary, Theft, Shoplifting, Assault Of An Officer, Or If An Undocumented Immigrant Admits To Commiting A Crime.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The legislation would require the secretary of Homeland Security to issue a detainer for undocumented immigrants arrested for or convicted of burglary, theft or shoplifting. The Senate adopted an amendment from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, that expanded the list of criminal offenses to include assaulting a police officer, as well as an amendment from Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, to require detention of undocumented immigrants if they admit to committing crimes." \[Congressional Quarterly, [[1/22/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8157191?7)\]
