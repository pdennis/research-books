# Natural Gas

### Fracking

**2025: Begich Voted To Prohibit A Moratorium On Fracking Without Congressional Authorization.** In February 2025, Begich voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would prohibit the president from imposing a moratorium on the use of hydraulic fracturing, unless such a moratorium were to be authorized by Congress. It would also express a sense of Congress that the states should maintain primacy for the regulation of oil and natural gas production on state and private lands." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 226 to 188. \[House Vote 35, [[2/7/25]{.underline}](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll035.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [[2/7/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/35?4); Congressional Actions, [[H.R. 26]{.underline}](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/26/all-actions)\]

### Prohibiting Instantaneous, Non-Condensed Gas Water Heaters

**2025: Begich Voted To Disapprove A Rule That Would Have Prohibited The Sale Of New Instantaneous, Non-Condensing Gas-Fired Water Heaters.** In February 2025, Begich voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the joint resolution that would nullify the Department of Energy's final rule issued on Dec. 26, 2024, that set new standards for instantaneous gas-fired water heaters and set to take effect on Dec. 26, 2029. The DOE rule would essentially prohibit the sale of new instantaneous, non-condensing gas-fired water heaters, but would allow for the sale and use of other instantaneous water heaters." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 221 to 198. \[House Vote 53, [[2/27/25]{.underline}](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll053.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [[2/27/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/53?4); Congressional Actions, [[H.J. Res. 20]{.underline}](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-joint-resolution/20/all-actions)\]
