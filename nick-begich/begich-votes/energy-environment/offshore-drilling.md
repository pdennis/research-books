### Outer Continental Shelf

**2025: Begich Voted To Disapprove An Interior Department Rule That Required An Archaeological Study Prior To Drilling In The Outer Continental Shelf.** In March 2025, Begich voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the joint resolution that would provide for congressional disapproval of, and nullify, the Interior Department\'s final rule which requires oil and gas operators that wish to explore or develop oil and natural gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf to conduct an archaeological study for their lease area. The rule requires such operators to submit the study to DOI's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management when they put forward exploration or development plans of such resources for approval, in order to ensure that such activities won\'t harm anything of historical, cultural or archaeological significance." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 221 to 202. \[House Vote 61, [[3/6/25]{.underline}](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll061.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [[3/6/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/61?4); Congressional Actions, [[S.J.Res. 11]{.underline}](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/11/all-actions)\]
