### Pollution

**2025: Begich Voted To Disapprove An EPA Rule That Established Emissions Standards For Rubber Processing In Tire Manufacturing.** In March 2025, Begich voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the joint resolution that would provide for congressional disapproval of, and nullify, an EPA final rule which established National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for rubber processing in tire manufacturing. The joint resolution would nullify the regulation, but disapproval of the rule would leave in place existing emissions standards for the other three phases of manufacturing rubber tires." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 216 to 202. \[House Vote 58, [[3/5/25]{.underline}](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll058.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [[3/5/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/58?4); Congressional Actions, [[H.J.Res. 61]{.underline}](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-joint-resolution/61/all-actions)\]
