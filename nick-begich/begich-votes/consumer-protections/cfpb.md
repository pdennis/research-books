# CFPB

### Overdraft Cap

**2025: Begich Voted To Disapprove A CFPB Rule That Would Have Limited Overdraft Fees To \$5 And Subject Institutions That Do Not Limit Their Fees To Lending Laws.** In March 2025, Begich voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, the joint resolution that would provide for congressional disapproval of, and nullify, a December 2024 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule which regulates overdraft protection services offered by very large financial institutions, including by capping the fees that covered institutions may charge for the service." The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 217 to 211. \[House Vote 96, [[4/9/25]{.underline}](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll096.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [[4/9/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/96?4); Congressional Actions, [[S.J.Res. 18]{.underline}](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/18/all-actions)\]

-   **Republicans Opposed The Measure, Calling It An Example Of "Midnight Rulemaking" While Democrats Argued It Would Decrease Banking Costs For Low-Income Americans.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republican critics say the regulation is an example of 'midnight rulemaking' that the CFPB engaged in after the election but before President Donald Trump's inauguration. Democrats defend the rule, saying it would help reduce banking costs for low-income savers." \[Congressional Quarterly, [[3/27/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8207309?6)\]

-   **The Cap Would Have Saved American Consumers \$5 Billion Annually.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Senate Banking ranking member Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., criticized Republicans for supporting the resolution. She said the rule would save Americans about \$5 billion annually by preventing exorbitant overdraft penalties." \[Congressional Quarterly, [[3/27/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8207309?6)\]

### Payment Apps

**2025: Begich Voted Against Granting The CFPB Supervisory Authority Over Payment Apps.** In March 2025, Begich voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the joint resolution that would provide for congressional disapproval of, and nullify, a December 2024 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule which established CFPB supervisory authority over non-bank entities that conduct 50 million or more digital financial transactions for consumers each year, and which would thereby subject FinTech entities that offer payment app services such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal and Venmo to deeper CFPB review." The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 219 to 211. \[House Vote 95, [[4/9/25]{.underline}](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll095.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [[4/9/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/95?4); Congressional Actions, [[S.J.Res. 28]{.underline}](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/28/all-actions)\]

-   **Democrats Argued Elon Musk And Republicans Opposed The Rule As It Would Impact Musk's Plan To Add A Payment System To X.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Democrats have warned that Trump adviser Elon Musk and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are throttling the CFPB in part to halt oversight of digital payment apps. They contend that it's a conflict of interest for Musk because of a payment system he intends to add to his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter." \[Congressional Quarterly, [[3/5/25]{.underline}](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8189366?2)\]
