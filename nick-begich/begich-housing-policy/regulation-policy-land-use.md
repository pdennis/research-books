# Regulation, Policy, and Land Use

### Summary

-   Nick Begich advocated for opening more federal land in Alaska for development and urged the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to address the state's housing crisis ([Arctic Sounder, 10/17/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6F-V6B1-DXVP-T136-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He criticized federal housing regulations that require rural Alaska communities to follow the same standards as those in the Lower 48, arguing that federal policies restrict land access in Alaska ([Juneau Empire, 10/22/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66P1-R5C1-F0HF-82J6-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich pointed to the cancellation of the Gravina Island bridge project in Ketchikan as a mistake that worsened local housing shortages, emphasizing the importance of infrastructure for addressing land use and development needs ([Anchorage Press, 9/21/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66FG-H7J1-JBCN-42HB-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He also criticized Sarah Palin's reversal on the "road to nowhere" project, arguing that maintaining support could have enabled housing development on nearby islands and alleviated current shortages ([Homer News, 9/24/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66GX-DYG1-JD2C-J0J8-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   A potential vulnerability is Begich's consistent positioning against federal oversight, which could draw criticism from those who favor strong federal land management and environmental standards.

### Stance on Federal Regulations Impacting Housing

#### Position on Federal Land Ownership and Use

**October 2024: Nick Begich Advocated Opening Federal Land And Pressuring Federal Reserve To Address Housing Crisis** According to Arctic Sounder, "To address Alaska's housing crisis, Begich said more federal land in Alaska should be opened for development. He also said more pressure should be exerted on the U.S. Federal Reserve to drop interest rates." \[Arctic Sounder, [10/17/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6F-V6B1-DXVP-T136-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2022: Begich Criticized Federal Housing Standards And Land Access Policies For Alaska Communities** According to Juneau Empire, "Begich said rural Alaska communities are forced to follow the same standards as communities in the Lower 48 and the federal government has 'locked up' land access in the state." \[Juneau Empire, [10/22/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66P1-R5C1-F0HF-82J6-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

#### Views on Environmental and Resource Development Policies

**September 2022: Begich Criticized Cancellation Of Gravina Island Bridge Project** According to Anchorage Press, "Begich brought applause in the city's civic center when he reminded attendees of the bridge. 'If we had a bridge in Ketchikan to Gravina Island, maybe we wouldn't have such a problem with housing down here,' Begich said. 'I will tell you, you know, when you see politicians trying to score political points by canceling the projects that this community relies on, that should tell you everything about where their priorities are. It's not with you. It's with them,' he said." \[Anchorage Press, [9/21/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66FG-H7J1-JBCN-42HB-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**September 2022: Begich Criticized Palin Over** "**Road To Nowhere**" **Reversal** According to Homer News, 'Begich got the attention of an audience and the press last week at a candidate forum by bringing up the long-ago and much-ridiculed "road to nowhere" in Ketchikan, arguing if Palin hadn't waffled and withdrawn her initial support there might now be housing on the adjacent island that could have lessened the town's current shortage.' \[Homer News (Alaska), [9/24/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66GX-DYG1-JD2C-J0J8-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
