# Affordable Housing Access and Development

### Summary

-   Proposing to open more federal land for development could face opposition from environmentalists and those concerned about land management ([Anchorage Daily News, 10/11/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D68-PCT1-DYRB-S2F1-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Calling for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates may be seen as unrealistic or outside the influence of a state politician ([Anchorage Daily News, 10/11/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5D-TN41-JC89-20KW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Advocacy for large infrastructure projects, like the Gravina Island bridge, risks criticism as "pork-barrel" spending and for reviving controversial proposals ([Alaska Dispatch News, 9/15/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66DS-T0C1-JCBJ-Y1WM-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Criticism of canceling community projects like the bridge could backfire with voters still wary of past failed projects and their associated costs ([Daily Sitka Sentinel, 9/16/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66F2-M9T1-DXVP-V4TX-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Emphasizing federal land and massive infrastructure may neglect local, incremental solutions to the housing crisis, leading to accusations of overlooking practical improvements.
