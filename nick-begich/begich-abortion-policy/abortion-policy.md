# Abortion Policy Stances

### Summary

-   Nick Begich has consistently identified as "pro-life" and opposed abortion access, with stated exceptions for cases of rape, incest, and when the life of the mother is at risk ([Anchorage Daily News](https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/05/03/qa-with-alaska-us-house-candidate-nick-begich/), [Daily Sitka Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:664Y-5Y41-DXVP-V451-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He has repeatedly supported the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, advocating for abortion policy to be determined at the state level rather than by Congress or through a federal mandate ([USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/29/who-is-nick-begich-alaska-house-seat/10347524002/), [Alaska Dispatch News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:663P-1401-DYTM-N33J-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich opposes federal funding, including Medicaid, for abortions---even in cases of rape and incest---and has voiced opposition to pharmacy distribution of abortion medication like mifepristone ([Kodiak Daily Mirror](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CNG-X481-JBCN-32TG-00000-00&context=1519360), [Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CN6-0W11-JD2C-J03S-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Recent statements emphasize local control, with Begich repeatedly saying he would not support a federal ban or a federal guarantee on abortion rights, arguing such decisions should be made by states ([NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DGC-5W21-JBCN-31BB-00000-00&context=1519360), [Fairbanks Daily News-Miner](https://www.newsminer.com/news/politics/nick-begich-iii-seeks-house-seat/article_ac4ef612-97b9-11ef-9bc2-13016b740aa6.html)).

-   Potential vulnerability: In pre-primary surveys and some media reports, Begich indicated support for a national abortion ban after 12 weeks, which contradicted his debate statements emphasizing state decision-making---raising concerns about inconsistency ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CS3-J0W1-JC89-200K-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arctic Sounder](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CSH-G2N1-JBCN-33TJ-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich has also expressed opposition to the use of military funds for abortion-related travel and has aligned himself with additional conservative positions, such as supporting a ban on transgender individuals in the military ([Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C86-6V61-F0HF-80NR-00000-00&context=1519360)).
