# Positions on Roe v. Wade and Federal Abortion Policy

### Reaction to Dobbs and Overturning Roe

**June 2022: Nick Begich Supported Supreme Court Decision Overturning Roe v. Wade And Preferred Returning Abortion Regulation To States** According to Alaska Dispatch News, "Both Begich and Palin celebrated the U.S. Supreme Court's decision, handed down on Friday, that reversed federal protections for abortion access guaranteed in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. \[...\] 'I think the court was correct in returning this issue to the states and here in the state of Alaska. ... it will now become a discussion for our state Legislature,' Begich said." \[Alaska Dispatch News, [6/28/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65T9-5YF1-DYTM-N49N-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2022: Begich Supported Roe v. Wade Overturn and State Control of Abortion Policy** According to Alaska Dispatch News, "I agree with the Supreme Court's decision. Under the 10th Amendment, any powers not specifically enumerated as being within the purview of the federal government are reserved for the states. We have a constitutional amendment process by which we may modify provisions related to this specific issue." \[Alaska Dispatch News, [8/6/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:663P-1401-DYTM-N334-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
