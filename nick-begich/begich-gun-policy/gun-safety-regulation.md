# Approach to Gun Safety and Regulation

### Views on Background Checks and Enforcement

#### Stance on Red Flag Laws

**2024: Nick Begich Opposed More Background Checks And Red Flag Laws For Gun Ownership** According to NBC - 2 KTUU (Anchorage, Alaska), 'Begich said he does not support more background checks or what are known as Red Flag Laws \[...\] "I don't think we need to create databases of people who own firearms in our nation. I think that's a big mistake," Begich said. "I think that that is the slippery slope that leads ultimately to the erosion of our Second Amendment rights."' \[NBC - 2 KTUU (Anchorage, Alaska), [10/11/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5D-55C1-JBCN-33B1-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
