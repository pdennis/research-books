# Agricultural Policy and Resource Development

### Summary

-   Nick Begich consistently advocated for robust resource development in Alaska, emphasizing support for mining, oil and gas, timber, and other key industries, and pledging not to reverse his stance if elected ([Bristol Bay Times & Dutch Harbor Fisherman](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6F-5X01-JBCN-31GN-00000-00&context=1519360), [Daily Sitka Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D91-N3M1-DXVP-T4FY-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He criticized federal and Biden administration policies for hindering resource development in Alaska, voicing concerns about underinvestment in critical infrastructure like roads, ports, harbors, and Coast Guard facilities ([Kodiak Daily Mirror](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D57-GVT1-JBCN-337D-00000-00&context=1519360), [Daily Sitka Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66K9-GNR1-JBCN-40KJ-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich promoted the development of Alaska's critical mineral resources as a means to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers, notably China and Russia, and highlighted Alaska's untapped mineral value in regions like Southeast Alaska ([Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66D4-TFY1-JD2C-J4J2-00000-00&context=1519360), [Daily Sitka Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68PJ-7F51-JBCN-3003-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He supported key infrastructure and access projects such as the proposed Ambler Road to unlock mineral-rich areas and argued for responsible local mining as an alternative to imports from problematic foreign sources ([Homer News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66GX-DYG1-JD2C-J0J8-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Labor and industry leaders, such as AFL-CIO President Hall, anticipated strong Begich support for Alaska's resource development, reinforcing his reputation among stakeholders ([NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DFR-6221-DXVP-T1H3-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerability: Begich's unwavering stance on resource extraction could face criticism from environmental groups or constituencies favoring stricter development oversight.

**Begich Emphasized Investment In Alaska's Hard Infrastructure And Coast Guard In 2024** According to Kodiak Daily Mirror, "I think it's critically important, particularly in Alaska as a young state, we've got to make sure that we're making investments in infrastructure. We missed out on so much of the Federal Highway investment prior to the formation of our state \[...\] It's also important here in Kodiak and throughout the state to invest in our Coast Guard. Coast Guard maintenance has been underfunded for some time and I think anyone who's had an opportunity to see the base recognizes that there are some maintenance opportunities we need to invest in, and so that's an important part of infrastructure as well, in addition to the ports and harbors, as was mentioned." \[Kodiak Daily Mirror (Alaska), [10/9/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D57-GVT1-JBCN-337D-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
