# Relationships with Political Figures and Parties

### Summary

-   Past support for Democratic candidates and family ties have raised questions about Begich's Republican commitment, with critics and GOP opponents highlighting his votes for Democrats and support for his uncle, former Sen. Mark Begich ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6643-YK31-JCBJ-Y471-00000-00&context=1519360), [Fairbanks Daily News-Miner](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65BP-7K91-DXVP-V1GG-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich's 2022 decision to challenge Don Young, after having served as Young's campaign co-chair, led to accusations of disloyalty and opportunism from Young, his staff, and other Alaska Republicans, damaging party unity ([Alaska Dispatch News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66R5-M5K1-DYTM-N14F-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Ongoing conflict and public attacks between Begich and Sarah Palin in 2022 contributed to divisions within the Alaska GOP, were blamed for the GOP's loss of the U.S. House seat, and fueled voter concerns about party infighting ([NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CVG-P7H1-JBCN-32NV-00000-00&context=1519360), [Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CF4-S871-JC89-2003-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich initially lacked support from national Republican leaders, including Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, both of whom only endorsed him after their preferred candidate dropped out---a sign of persistent doubts among national GOP establishment figures ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0M-V551-JC89-24F7-00000-00&context=1519360), [Bristol Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CV7-WWK1-JBCN-304K-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Fluctuating relationships and rivalries with high-profile Republicans---such as public criticism from Trump (accusing Begich of costing the party Alaska's House seat and labeling him as having "Democrat tendencies") and initial lack of establishment backing---have made Begich's position within the GOP appear unstable ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CF4-S871-JC89-2003-00000-00&context=1519360), [Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C8W-3TJ1-F0HF-83P5-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich's alignment with the House Freedom Caucus and support from hardline conservative groups has led some opponents and observers to portray him as too extreme or obstructionist, risking alienation of moderate voters and collaboration-minded colleagues ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5D-TN41-JC89-20KW-00000-00&context=1519360), [NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5D-55C1-JBCN-33B1-00000-00&context=1519360)).
