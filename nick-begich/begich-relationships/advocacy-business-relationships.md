# Relationships with Advocacy, Business, and Interest Groups

### Summary

-   Nick Begich publicly praised Elon Musk and his team for their innovation, calling Musk "one of our nation's greatest innovators" during a February 2025 Fox News appearance ([Dermot Cole, Reporting From Alaska](https://www.dermotcole.com/reportingfromalaska/2025/2/20/its-not-the-age-of-the-doge-boys)).

-   Begich participated in a candidate forum hosted by major oil company ConocoPhillips in August 2022, indicating his engagement with powerful business interests ([Alaska Dispatch News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:665K-RT51-JCBJ-Y2TY-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   His involvement in forums sponsored by large corporate groups like ConocoPhillips highlights ongoing relationships with influential industry stakeholders.

-   In September 2024, Begich did not respond to a request for comment from NBC - 2 KTUU regarding election commentary, which could suggest limited transparency or selective engagement with certain media outlets ([NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CWR-6XY1-DXVP-T0CY-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Participation in high-profile forums and public praise for business leaders may open Begich to criticism over potential preferential alignment with corporate rather than grassroots or advocacy groups.
