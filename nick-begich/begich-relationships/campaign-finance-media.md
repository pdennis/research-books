### Campaign Fundraising

**October 2024: Begich Questioned Crypto Influence On Opponent's Campaign** According to Anchorage Daily News, "Begich seized on her apparent lack of expertise with crypto and said that showed how influence is peddled in Washington. 'And I wanted to raise this question because I wanted to show Alaskans, look, this is how people buy votes in Congress. This is what they do,' he said." \[Anchorage Daily News (Alaska), [10/11/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5M-YN31-DXVP-T0B5-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
