# Positions on Election and Campaign Reform

### Summary

-   Nick Begich has been an outspoken critic of Alaska's ranked-choice voting (RCV) system, consistently calling it confusing and susceptible to manipulation, and has publicly supported efforts to repeal it, including Ballot Measure 2 ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D7R-NS71-JC89-214C-00000-00&context=1519360), [NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D7R-V2H1-JBCN-32WB-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich co-led and co-sponsored federal legislation in 2025 to prohibit the use of ranked-choice voting in federal elections, arguing that "one person, one vote" is clearer and better represents voters' intent ([Press Release](https://begich.house.gov/media/press-releases), [Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPH-3KT3-SCGM-H3S2-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He claims RCV causes vote-splitting, ballot exhaustion, and makes it more difficult for Republicans to win when multiple candidates from the same party run, while also contending that removing partisan primaries makes Alaska's elections more vulnerable to manipulation ([NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CVG-P7H1-JBCN-32NV-00000-00&context=1519360), [Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D7R-NS71-JC89-214C-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Despite his opposition, some analysts argue that ranked-choice voting can, in certain scenarios, benefit Begich and encourage Republican unity, and have urged him to help conservative voters adapt to the system ([Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D81-4DP1-DXVP-T29F-00000-00&context=1519360), [Nome Nugget](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DGM-C7B1-DXVP-T479-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich has also raised concerns about campaign finance and outside influence, specifically questioning large crypto-linked contributions to his opponent's campaign, claiming it illustrates how "influence is peddled in Washington" ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D68-PCT1-DYRB-S2F1-00000-00&context=1519360), [NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5D-55C1-JBCN-33B1-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He suggested incremental improvements to election accessibility, such as increasing the number of early voting sites statewide ([Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DC6-VB61-DXVP-T2TC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

**November 2024: Ranked Choice Voting Process Was Expected To Benefit Begich** According to Nome Nugget (Alaska), "While the race appears to be headed to ranked choice voting, Begich is positioned to expand his lead through the process. That's because the third-highest vote getter, John Wayne Howe of the Alaskan Independence Party, ran to Begich's right. Under ranked choice voting, the votes of lower ranking candidates are redistributed to leading contenders based on the voters' secondary choices. Howe's voters are likely to have favored Begich in their secondary choices." \[Nome Nugget (Alaska), [11/21/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DGM-C7B1-DXVP-T479-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**August 2022: Begich Opposed Ranked Choice Voting System In Alaska** According to Peninsula Clarion, 'Begich said he's not a fan of ranked choice, which he called a "national experiment" funded by "dark money," since "what it does is it eliminates a true primary." "We're effectively running a primary and a general election at the same time," he said. I think that creates some counter-productivity including keeping voters from closely parsing candidates' positions.' \[Peninsula Clarion (Kenai, Alaska), [8/1/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:662N-D4D1-JD2C-J4M5-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

He added it would also be essential for a losing Republican candidate to bow out and support the more favorable Republican if necessary, something he would commit to. \[...\] 'I want to win,' he told voters, but stressed it's important to have unity. The key to doing so, he told the News-Miner is that voters must fully complete the ballot. He said the ranked choice voting system, coupled with an election-heavy year, changed the outcome in 2022. \[...\] 'Ranked choice voting is what we have regardless of how we feel about it,' Begich said. 'It behoves us to fill out ballot and make sure we rank all the people we would like to potentially see in office.'" \[Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, [1/26/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B69-W411-JBCN-30B1-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
