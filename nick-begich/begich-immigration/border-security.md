# Border Security and Enforcement

### Summary

-   Nick Begich has consistently opposed bipartisan immigration reform efforts, instead advocating for tougher border security measures and aligning with positions backed by former President Trump ([NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5D-55C1-JBCN-33B1-00000-00&context=1519360), 10/11/24).

-   Begich voted in favor of the Laken Riley Act, stating it would provide law enforcement with tools to detain and deport dangerous illegal immigrants, and described this as a step toward putting Americans first ([NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DVT-NCH3-S6SY-G1YT-00000-00&context=1519360), 1/10/25).

-   He has voiced strong criticism of current immigration policies under the Biden Administration, describing the influx of migrants as "unsustainable" and stating that undocumented immigrants should be deported regardless of their contributions to Alaska's economy ([Kodiak Daily Mirror](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C5Y-7BH1-JBCN-3157-00000-00&context=1519360), [Fairbanks Daily News-Miner](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5G-GT43-RRKG-M2WG-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich supports smart, legal immigration and has argued that current policies disadvantage would-be legal immigrants while enabling undocumented entrants to receive public benefits ([Alaska Dispatch News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:663P-1401-DYTM-N334-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Although border security is a central campaign issue for Begich, as of September 2024 his official website did not provide specific policy solutions for securing the border, which could indicate a vulnerability or lack of transparency in his platform ([NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D2D-JHD1-DXVP-T3MH-00000-00&context=1519360)).

That is unacceptable. These people are receiving free health care, free medical attention, free housing, free transportation, free education, and it's not free. We're paying for it," Begich said.' \[NBC - 2 KTUU (Anchorage, Alaska), [10/11/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5D-55C1-JBCN-33B1-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

Porous borders undermine on important component of national security; we must ensure only legal entry to our nation is permitted." \[Alaska Dispatch News, [8/6/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:663P-1401-DYTM-N334-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**Nick Begich III Criticized Biden Administration On Immigration in 2024** According to Kodiak Daily Mirror, "We've seen that the Biden Administration is not serious in solving this problem. We've learned recently that the Biden Administration has flown nearly half a million people directly from their country of origin into the United States. \[...\] This influx is 'unsustainable, not good for the country,' said Begich." \[Kodiak Daily Mirror, [6/4/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C5Y-7BH1-JBCN-3157-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
