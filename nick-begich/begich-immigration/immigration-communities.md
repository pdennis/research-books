# Immigration and Local Communities

### Summary

-   Nick Begich opposes the use of foreign seasonal workers under the H-1B visa program in Alaska's fishing industry, advocating for prioritizing Alaskan workers due to a 4% state unemployment rate ([Daily Sitka Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5K-0211-DXVP-T01J-00000-00&context=1519360), [Fairbanks Daily News-Miner](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5B-6021-JBCN-331N-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   In contrast, Rep. Mary Peltola supports continuing the practice of hiring foreign seasonal workers for Alaska's seafood processing industry.

-   Begich's position highlights a focus on local employment, emphasizing that available jobs should go to Alaskans before hiring individuals from outside the nation.

-   When discussing the Laken Riley Act, Begich did not provide details on how the legislation would affect Alaska specifically, which could be seen as a lack of clarity or specificity on local impacts ([NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DVT-NCH3-S6SY-G1YT-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich's stance may be vulnerable to criticism from business groups that rely on foreign labor to fill workforce shortages in seasonal industries.
