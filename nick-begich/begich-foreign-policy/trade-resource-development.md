### Resource Extraction and Export Policies

#### Support for Oil Drilling and Mining

**2024: Nick Begich Supported Restricting Russian Fish Products Entering U.S. Markets, Urged Faster Action** In an interview with Kodiak Daily Mirror, Nick Begich said, "I think what we've been doing to restrict dumping of those products into U.S. markets has been good. I think it could have been done more quickly, but I think it's important to ensure that Russian fish products are not entering the United States, they're not being redirected through China to the United States. I think that's really important." \[Interview - Nick Begich with Kodiak Daily Mirror, [10/24/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D87-3CN1-JBCN-31TS-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

#### Opposition to Federal Executive Restrictions

**February 2025: Begich Supported** "**America First**" **Policy And Ended Prioritization Of Foreign Aid Over U.S. Citizens** According to Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, "Begich also agreed with Trump's 'America First' policy and cited claims that foreign aid has caused a significant portion of the federal debt. He also defended the Trump administration's tariff decisions. 'That deficit has accumulated partially because we have prioritized the rest of the world over our own citizens,' Begich said. 'I think that needs to end.'" \[Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, [2/19/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5G-GT43-RRKG-M2WG-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2025: Begich Worked On Fair Trade Policies For Alaska Seafood** According to Kodiak Daily Mirror, "I'm working to ensure reciprocal and fair trade across the board when it comes to seafood exports. Alaska should have an advantage, not just a level playing field. I want Alaskans to have an advantage going into international market." \[Kodiak Daily Mirror (Alaska), [4/18/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FKR-YH83-RSKV-M53V-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2025: Begich Discussed Tariff And Trade Barrier Concerns Affecting U.S. And Alaska Fisheries** According to Kodiak Daily Mirror, "Look at the tariffs and trade barriers that have been erected among other countries. The United States for the longest time has had the lowest barriers to access to our markets. \[...\] lack of reciprocity has made it difficult." \[Kodiak Daily Mirror (Alaska), [4/18/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FKR-YH83-RSKV-M53V-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Federal Land and Waterway Management

#### Support for Alaskan Waterway Development

**2022: Nick Begich III Advocated Working Through International Joint Commission For Transboundary Waters** According to Juneau Empire, "Transboundary waters are managed by the International Joint Commission, a special inter-governmental working group between the United States and Canada, and involve lakes and river waterways that are shared between our nations. \[...\] Congress must work through this institution as an inter-governmental working group to ensure that water entering or leaving our respective nations remains clean, that fish populations remain robust, and international commerce is not unreasonably impeded." \[Juneau Empire (Alaska), [8/12/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6665-CB61-JD2C-J4GW-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
