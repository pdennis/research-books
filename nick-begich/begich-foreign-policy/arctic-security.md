# Arctic and Alaskan Security and Sovereignty

### Summary

-   Nick Begich has repeatedly echoed or declined to correct false claims by Donald Trump about U.S. aid and casualties in Ukraine, raising concerns about his willingness to confront misinformation ([Anchorage Daily News, Feb. 2025](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5S-8NN3-RT31-C0JM-00000-00&context=1519360); [Juneau Empire, Feb. 2025](https://www.juneauempire.com/news/begich-supports-trumps-federal-cutbacks-but-i-recognize-the-process-wont-be-perfect/)).

-   Begich has been hesitant or outright declined to directly endorse continued U.S. aid to Ukraine, placing him at odds with most of Alaska's congressional delegation and potentially alienating pro-Ukraine voters ([Daily Sitka Sentinel, Feb. 2025](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F7G-6K53-RY93-532G-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Public support for Trump's proposal to annex Greenland, including comparisons to historic U.S. land acquisitions, has prompted criticism for promoting unrealistic or provocative foreign policy ideas ([Anchorage Daily News, Jan. 2025](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DVV-GS63-RW41-X38X-00000-00&context=1519360); [Letters to the Editor](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DY3-WFM3-RSJ4-C47K-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Statements blaming Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for diplomatic failures shift responsibility away from Russian aggression and may be perceived as unsupportive of Ukraine's sovereignty ([Anchorage Daily News, Mar. 2025](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F88-MHR3-S5TM-T1WJ-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Emphasis on limiting U.S. spending abroad and prioritizing domestic needs is popular with some constituents, but risks being seen as isolationist or undermining international commitments, especially in the Arctic and allied security matters ([NBC - 2 KTUU, Oct. 2024](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5D-55C1-JBCN-33B1-00000-00&context=1519360); [Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, Feb. 2025](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5G-GT43-RRKG-M2WG-00000-00&context=1519360)).
