# Curriculum and Policy Issues

### Summary

-   Nick Begich's strong support for the partisan "Parents Bill of Rights" may alienate moderate or independent voters, especially since it was backed only by Republicans and not supported by Rep. Peltola ([Alaska Beacon](https://alaskabeacon.com/2023/07/14/republican-nick-begich-will-challenge-democrat-mary-peltola-in-alaskas-2024-u-s-house-race/), [Daily Sitka Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68PJ-7F51-JBCN-3003-00000-00&context=1519360), [Kodiak Daily Mirror](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68R2-MS71-DXVP-T3N8-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Publicly highlighting differences with Peltola on parental rights and education issues could be perceived as polarizing, potentially limiting appeal to broader constituencies ([Alaska Beacon](https://alaskabeacon.com/2023/07/14/republican-nick-begich-will-challenge-democrat-mary-peltola-in-alaskas-2024-u-s-house-race/)).

-   Advocacy for school choice and moving federal funding control to the local level may face criticism from public school advocates and teachers' unions ([Alaskans for Nick Begich](https://www.alaskansfornickbegich.com/solutions)).

-   Emphasis on private, homeschool, and competition-based education solutions could draw pushback from those concerned about diverting funds from public schools ([Alaskans for Nick Begich](https://www.alaskansfornickbegich.com/solutions)).

-   The repeated use of the "Parents Bill of Rights" as an example of contrast with Peltola may reinforce a perception of prioritizing partisan policy over bipartisan or locally tailored solutions.
