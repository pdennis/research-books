### Summary

-   Nick Begich, a Republican who previously lost to incumbent Democrat Mary Peltola, announced in July 2023 that he would run again for Alaska's U.S. House seat in 2024 ([Anchorage Daily News](https://www.adn.com/politics/2023/07/13/republican-nick-begich-to-challenge-incumbent-democrat-mary-peltola-in-alaskas-us-house-race/), [Alaska Beacon](https://alaskabeacon.com/2023/07/14/republican-nick-begich-will-challenge-democrat-mary-peltola-in-alaskas-2024-u-s-house-race/)).

-   In the August 2024 primary, Begich placed second overall with 27% of the vote, trailing behind Peltola, while fellow Republican Nancy Dahlstrom came in third ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D68-6FM1-DYRB-S404-00000-00&context=1519360), [NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CSS-XVV1-JBCN-309M-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich publicly committed to dropping out of the race if another Republican finished ahead of him in the primary, aiming to avoid the GOP splitting votes and increase the party's chances against Peltola in the general election ([NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CSS-XVV1-JBCN-309M-00000-00&context=1519360), [Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D68-6FM1-DYRB-S404-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The Begich campaign has primarily focused on Republican strongholds and targeted Peltola's congressional record, rather than appealing to moderate voters ([Bristol Bay Times & Dutch Harbor Fisherman](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CSJ-4C21-JBCN-303R-00000-00&context=1519360), [Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CSR-FG21-DYRB-S002-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Some Republican critics argue Begich's narrative about consolidating support is intended to compensate for his repeated third-place primary finishes, suggesting the potential for lingering divisions within the party ([Bristol Bay Times & Dutch Harbor Fisherman](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CSJ-4C21-JBCN-303R-00000-00&context=1519360)).
