# Electoral History and Campaigns

### Summary

-   Nick Begich III first sought elected office in 2016 (losing an Anchorage Assembly race), co-chaired Don Young's 2020 re-election, and launched his first U.S. House campaign as a Republican in October 2021, initially challenging Young from the right prior to Young's death ([Anchorage Daily News](https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/10/22/nick-begich-republican-son-of-alaskas-leading-democratic-family-will-run-for-us-house/), [Alaska's News Source](https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2023/07/13/nick-begich-back-race-alaskas-us-house-seat/)).

-   In 2022, under Alaska's new open primary and ranked-choice voting system, Begich ran in both the special and general elections for U.S. House, finishing third each time behind Democrat Mary Peltola and former Republican Gov. Sarah Palin, despite backing from the Alaska Republican Party and numerous Republican leaders ([Anchorage Daily News](https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/04/22/nick-begich-iii-is-first-to-receive-alaska-republican-party-endorsement-in-crowded-us-house-race/), [Juneau Empire](https://www.juneauempire.com/news/nick-begich-declares-victory-in-u-s-house-primary-dahlstrom-expected-to-exit-race/)).

-   Begich and Palin split the GOP vote and publicly attacked each other during the 2022 elections, leading many Begich voters to either not rank Palin or to choose Peltola second, a dynamic widely credited with aiding Peltola's historic wins ([Anchorage Daily News](https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/09/05/sarah-palin-criticizes-republican-leaders-and-calls-on-nick-begich-to-leave-house-race-after-special-election-loss/), [Juneau Empire](https://www.juneauempire.com/news/political-commentary-rank-the-red-how-alaskas-special-election-changed-the-political-game/)).

-   After two defeats to Peltola in 2022, Begich announced a second congressional run in July 2023 for the 2024 race, ultimately consolidating Republican support after primary rivals---including Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom---dropped out, and securing key GOP endorsements ([Anchorage Daily News](https://www.adn.com/politics/2024/08/23/peltola-begich-dahlstrom-move-on-to-alaskas-november-congressional-general-election/), [Must Read Alaska](https://mustreadalaska.com/young-gun-nrcc-names-nick-begich-to-powerhouse-campaign-building-program/)).

-   In November 2024, Begich defeated Peltola in the general election, flipping Alaska's U.S. House seat back to Republican control via ranked-choice voting, though he underperformed compared to Trump's concurrent statewide results ([Anchorage Daily News](https://www.adn.com/politics/2024/11/21/begich-defeats-incumbent-peltola-in-alaskas-house-race/), [NBC-2 KTUU](https://www.ktuu.com/2024/11/22/nick-begich-wins-house/)).

-   Potential vulnerabilities highlighted by media and GOP critics included Begich's earlier election losses, risk of divided Republican vote, and issues around campaign strategy and resource management ([Anchorage Daily News](https://www.adn.com/politics/2024/06/24/opinion-nick-begich-primary-plan-wrong-choice/), [Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman](https://www.frontiersman.com/news/letter-begich-should-step-down/)).
