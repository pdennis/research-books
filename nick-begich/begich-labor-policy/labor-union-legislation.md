# Legislation and Policy Proposals Affecting Labor Unions

### Summary

-   Nick Begich consistently opposed proposals to raise Alaska's minimum wage, including the plan to reach \$15 by 2027, aligning himself with industry groups who also object to the increase ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5M-YN31-DXVP-T0B5-00000-00&context=1519360), [Bristol Bay Times & Dutch Harbor Fisherman](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6F-5X01-JBCN-31GN-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arctic Sounder](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6F-V6B1-DXVP-T136-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich stated he would vote against Ballot Measure 1, which proposes both raising the minimum wage and mandating paid sick leave, arguing that most Alaska wages are already above the proposed minimum and that new regulations could harm businesses ([Daily Sitka Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5M-47Y1-DXVP-T339-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He emphasized the importance of keeping entry-level jobs available, suggesting that a low minimum wage helps young workers and others needing work find employment ([Bristol Bay Times & Dutch Harbor Fisherman](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6F-5X01-JBCN-31GN-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich's opposition presents a vulnerability with organized labor groups and advocates for higher wages and improved worker benefits, potentially impacting his support among pro-labor constituencies.

-   This pattern of opposition is documented in multiple reputable Alaska news sources throughout October 2024, highlighting a clear and consistent policy stance ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D68-PCT1-DYRB-S2F1-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arctic Sounder](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6F-V6B1-DXVP-T136-00000-00&context=1519360)).
