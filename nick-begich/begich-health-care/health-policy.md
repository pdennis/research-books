# Health Policy and Public Health Issues

### Summary

-   Consistent opposition to vaccine mandates and pandemic restrictions may alienate voters who prioritize public health measures or support a stronger government response ([Alaska Dispatch News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:663P-1401-DYTM-N334-00000-00&context=1519360), [Homer News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66SG-R981-F0HF-81RP-00000-00&context=1519360), [Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66R3-K571-JD2C-J1MT-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Framing the federal COVID-19 response as misguided and overly politicized could appeal to some base voters, but may be viewed as dismissive of scientific and expert consensus by others ([Peninsula Clarion](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:64HW-GPH1-JD2C-J4F2-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Strong focus on economic fallout from pandemic policies may open up criticism for downplaying lives lost or health consequences during the crisis ([Peninsula Clarion](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:64HW-GPH1-JD2C-J4F2-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Statements that pandemic measures were "not science, but political science" risk alienating constituents who relied on public health guidance ([Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66R3-K571-JD2C-J1MT-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   While involvement in youth suicide prevention research demonstrates bipartisan engagement, it may not offset criticisms from more contentious stances on health policy ([Press Release - Begich House](https://begich.house.gov/media/press-releases))

-   Expressed concern about the fentanyl crisis shows awareness but lacks a clear policy response, which opponents could frame as insufficient action ([Kodiak Daily Mirror](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C5Y-7BH1-JBCN-3157-00000-00&context=1519360))

### Mental Health and Substance Abuse

#### Support for Mental Health Services

**2025: Nick Begich Introduced Bipartisan Youth Suicide Prevention Research Act** According to a press release from Representative Nick Begich's office, "Congressman Nick Begich (AK-AL) and Congresswoman Laura Gillen (NY-04) introduced the Youth Suicide Prevention Research Act, bipartisan legislation to enhance federal research into the underlying causes of youth suicide." \[Press Release - Representative Nick Begich Alaska at Large, [4/7/25](https://begich.house.gov/media/press-releases)\]

#### Opioid and Substance Abuse Policy

**Nick Begich III Expressed Concern About Fentanyl Crisis in 2024** According to Kodiak Daily Mirror, "I've met several people on the campaign trail who have shared their stories, of family, friends and colleagues, who have either passed away or have been impacted by the crisis which has made its way into our communities; even the most rural," Begich said. \[Kodiak Daily Mirror, [6/4/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C5Y-7BH1-JBCN-3157-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Pandemic Response and Emergency Preparedness

#### COVID-19 Policy and Vaccination Measures

**Begich Criticized Political Polarization Of COVID-19 Response** According to Peninsula Clarion, 'I think we need to look at the science, de-politicize both the science and our response to it, and let the data lead the conversation,' he said. 'The response to the pandemic has become so political that we've drowned out scientific voices of reason.' \[Peninsula Clarion, [1/12/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:64HW-GPH1-JD2C-J4F2-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**Begich Asserted Economic Damage From Pandemic Response** According to Peninsula Clarion, 'I believe we've damaged our economy, more than we ever should have,' he said. 'It's the result of continued polarization in our nation, and we've got to find common ground and come back together as people.' \[Peninsula Clarion, [1/12/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:64HW-GPH1-JD2C-J4F2-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2022: Begich Criticized Federal COVID-19 Response and Opposed Vaccine Mandates** According to Alaska Dispatch News, "I believe in individual responsibility and data-driven science. The government's response to COVID-19 did not always follow the underlying science, and as a result many Americans missed a key message that would have dramatically diminished underlying risk, not just for COVID-19 but for diabetes, heart health, and more: namely diet and exercise. I am totally opposed to vaccine mandates and similar government restrictions. The federal government's response to COVID has burdened an entire generation of Americans with even greater debt and a psychological imprint of misplaced panic." \[Alaska Dispatch News, [8/6/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:663P-1401-DYTM-N334-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2022: Nick Begich Opposed Vaccine Mandates And Criticized Federal COVID-19 Response** According to Alaska Dispatch News, "I am totally opposed to vaccine mandates and similar government restrictions. The federal government's response to COVID has burdened an entire generation of Americans with even greater debt and a psychological imprint of misplaced panic." \[Alaska Dispatch News, [8/7/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:663P-1401-DYTM-N33J-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**October 2022: Begich Opposed Government Vaccine Mandates** According to Homer News, "When asked if the government should be able to mandate vaccinations, Begich, Bye and Palin said no." \[Homer News (Alaska), [10/27/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66SG-R981-F0HF-81RP-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**October 2022: Begich Opposed Government Vaccine Mandates During Pandemic** According to Juneau Empire (Alaska), "I think its critically important we realize that what was done during this pandemic was not science, but political science. We saw politicians dig in their heels, and policymakers in unelected positions at the CDC and elsewhere deciding how you and I were going to live. This is not good. We've ceded too much authority to the government, whether that be vaccine mandates that are required to get a job or keep a job. I've been opposed to that from the very beginning and we need to trust the people, we need to trust at the local level and we need to make sure were not shutting down aspects of the economy. Thousands of businesses were shut down because of government." \[Juneau Empire (Alaska), [10/27/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66R3-K571-JD2C-J1MT-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
