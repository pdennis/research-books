-   Constituents, including advocates like Essie Frank, expressed feelings of betrayal after Begich assured them of his commitment to protecting Medicaid but then voted for a measure jeopardizing funding ([Anchorage Daily News, 2/27/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F72-3WH3-RTJ4-70PC-00000-00&context=1519360)).
