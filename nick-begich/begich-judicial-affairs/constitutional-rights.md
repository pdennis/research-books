# Constitutional Rights and Legal Process

### Civil Liberties and Due Process

#### Protection of Free Speech

**2022: Nick Begich III Called For Transparency Regarding FBI's Mar-a-Lago Warrant** According to Juneau Empire, "The search warrant executed on the residence of a former president is unprecedented in our nation's history. Given the level of division within our nation and the erosion of public trust in our nation's institutions, the Justice department should take immediate action to ensure that the public is informed as to the justification for such a warrant. Any attempt by members of one political party to unduly direct the justice system against political figures of another party should be of grave concern to any American, regardless of their personal political beliefs. Justice must be applied equally to all, and only through full transparency may jurisprudential confidence be preserved." \[Juneau Empire (Alaska), [8/12/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6665-CB61-JD2C-J4GW-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

#### Right to a Fair Trial

**October 2022: Begich Expressed Doubt About The Jan. 6 Committee's Purpose But Affirmed Congress's Subpoena Authority** According to Juneau Empire (Alaska), "It is within the authority of Congress to subpoena an individual, including a past president, and it is within their legal authority to do that. Whether this Jan 6 commission is really just a political witch hunt or a well-intentioned commission, I think that's up for some debate as well. The Democrats have wanted to hang onto Jan. 6, but they've ignored the fundamental problems of this country\[...\]. They've ignored the fundamental problems of working families, Inflation is the issue that they don't want want to talk about because it's a losing issue for them. And when you look at the Democrat policies across the country and how they wreaked havoc on working families you know why." \[Juneau Empire (Alaska), [10/27/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66R3-K571-JD2C-J1MT-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
