# Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement Policy

### Summary

-   Nick Begich emphasized the importance of the rule of law and stated that those responsible for the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack should be held accountable by the courts based on evidence beyond a reasonable doubt ([Alaska Dispatch News, 8/6/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:663P-1401-DYTM-N334-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He opposed the impeachment of Donald Trump and instead called for investigations into actions by the Biden administration, including Afghanistan withdrawal and alleged ties to Ukrainian and Chinese entities ([Juneau Empire, 8/12/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6665-CB61-JD2C-J4GW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   A letter to the editor criticized Begich for "sidestepping" the question of holding Trump directly accountable for January 6, suggesting he deferred responsibility to the courts without offering a clear position ([Alaska Dispatch News, 8/14/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6659-TK11-JCBJ-Y1J9-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich's stance underscores a general principle that no one is above the law, regardless of status or office.

-   Potential vulnerability: Critics argue that Begich avoided taking a firm stand on Trump's role in January 6, leaving some questions about his commitment to direct accountability.

### Criminal Sentencing and Reform

#### Sentencing Guidelines Approach

**2022: Begich Called For Rule of Law In Jan. 6 Accountability** According to Alaska Dispatch News, "We are a nation built on rule of law and the enforcement thereof. Further, no citizen may stand above the law, irrespective of their position. Any determination of who bears responsibility for illegal acts conducted at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2020 must rest with the courts and should be determined based on those sets of facts that pass the test of reasonable doubt." \[Alaska Dispatch News, [8/6/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:663P-1401-DYTM-N334-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Law Enforcement Agencies

#### Federal Law Enforcement Jurisdiction

**2022: Nick Begich III Opposed Impeachment Of Donald Trump And Supported Investigation Into Biden Administration** According to Juneau Empire, "No; I did not support impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump. The Biden administration's actions with respect to the chaotic and mismanaged withdrawal from Afghanistan, failure to address surging illegal migration at the U.S.' most southern border, and prior or existing relationships with Ukrainian energy providers and Chinese private equity funds are each worthy of Congressional investigation." \[Juneau Empire (Alaska), [8/12/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6665-CB61-JD2C-J4GW-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2022: Letter Writer Gregg Brelsford Claimed Nick Begich Did Not Address Holding Trump Accountable for January 6 Attack** According to a letter to the editor published in Alaska Dispatch News, "Begich sidestepped the second question, too, kicking it to the courts to decide." \[Letter to the Editor - Alaska Dispatch News, [8/14/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6659-TK11-JCBJ-Y1J9-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
