# Entrepreneurship and Business Ventures

### Summary

-   FarShore Partners, founded by Nick Begich III, has been criticized for employing the vast majority of its workforce overseas (primarily in India and Croatia) and having no employees in Alaska, raising concerns about offshoring jobs rather than creating local employment opportunities ([Anchorage Daily News](https://www.adn.com/politics/2023/07/13/republican-nick-begich-to-challenge-incumbent-democrat-mary-peltola-in-alaskas-us-house-race/), [NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D2D-JHD1-DXVP-T3MH-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich holds a substantial ownership stake and officer roles in Earthpulse Press, a company associated with publishing controversial or conspiratorial content, though he claims no operational role and has publicly distanced himself from its beliefs ([Alaska Landmine](https://alaskalandmine.com/landmines/congressional-candidate-nick-begich-iii-co-owns-holds-key-positions-at-notorious-conspiracy-theory-organization/), [Alaska Beacon](https://alaskabeacon.com/2024/10/15/on-u-s-house-candidates-disclosure-form-successful-investments-and-a-conspiratorial-publisher/)).

-   Critics highlight that Begich's business experience has been almost exclusively in the private sector with little or no prior legislative or government service, prompting concerns about his readiness for public office ([Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CPF-7K31-DXVP-T54K-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Questions have been raised about Begich's knowledge of core Alaska issues and the extent to which his out-of-state and international business operations align with Alaska's economic or employment interests ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DG4-YXM1-JC89-200V-00000-00&context=1519360), [Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CPF-7K31-DXVP-T54K-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Anti-Begich political ads and campaigns have seized on his record of offshoring, suggesting it undermines claims of job creation and local economic benefit in Alaska ([NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D2D-JHD1-DXVP-T3MH-00000-00&context=1519360)).
