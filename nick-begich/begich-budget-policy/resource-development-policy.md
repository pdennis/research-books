### Energy and Natural Resources Budget Priorities

#### Support for Infrastructure Investment

**February 2025: Nick Begich Called For Greater Investment In Alaska's Infrastructure And Appropriate Staffing Levels For Air Safety** According to Peninsula Clarion, "Begich said it's important to invest in Alaska's infrastructure, such as redundant power conductivity systems and cameras in remote locations. He also said staffing levels need to be appropriate and that they are trained with adequate resources." \[Peninsula Clarion, [2/18/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5B-3P63-RXC7-J3KK-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**February 2025: Nick Begich Supported Investment In Alaska Infrastructure And FAA Staffing** According to Juneau Empire, "Begich said it's important to invest in Alaska's infrastructure, such as redundant power conductivity systems and cameras in remote locations. He also said staffing levels need to be appropriate and that they are trained with adequate resources." \[Juneau Empire, [2/18/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F58-FW83-RS72-90H0-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

#### Support for Oil and Mineral Extraction

**September 2022: Begich Advocated For Permanent Federal Highway Funding For Alaska Marine Highway System** According to Juneau Empire, Begich said, "I believe that in order to ensure the marine highway system is adequately financed and funded we need to make sure it's a permanent part of how our highway funding formula is maintained at the federal level." \[Juneau Empire (Alaska), [9/15/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66D4-TFY1-JD2C-J4J2-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**January 2024: Nick Begich Supported Federal Funding For Alaska Railbelt Transmission Lines** According to Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, "He called a recent U.S. Energy Department grant for \$206 million to overhaul the Alaska Railbelt transmission lines a positive example, since it provides hard infrastructure that will enhance energy resiliency and won't cost ratepayers in the long-term. 'We've got to do more to drive down energy costs in Alaska,' Begich said. 'If we don't say yes to these federal dollars, we'll be spending our own anyway.'" \[Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, [1/26/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B69-W411-JBCN-30B1-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

'It seems like everything is going in the wrong direction. This is what happens when you put Democrats in charge,' Begich said in one of the videos." \[Alaska Dispatch News, [10/10/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66KJ-44C1-JCBJ-Y14F-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
