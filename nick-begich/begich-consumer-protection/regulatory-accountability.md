# Regulatory and Government Accountability

### Summary

-   Nick Begich took a cautious stance on the proposed Kroger--Albertsons (Fred Meyer--Carrs) grocery merger, emphasizing the need to maintain competition in Alaska ([Anchorage Daily News, 10/11/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5D-TN41-JC89-20KW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich stated he supports firms' ability to merge but stressed the importance of protecting consumers and ensuring competitive markets.

-   During a debate, Begich gave answers that some considered contradictory---supporting both competition and the merger while highlighting the need for consumer protections ([Robin Smith, Anchorage Daily News, 10/27/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D91-GTX1-DYRB-S07W-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Critics, including Robin Smith in Anchorage Daily News, pointed out that Begich gave conflicting or unclear responses about the merger and its potential impact ([Robin Smith, Anchorage Daily News, 10/27/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D92-GHD1-DXVP-T0DC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   A potential vulnerability for Begich is the perception that he has not taken a clear or consistent position on major regulatory issues, particularly high-profile mergers affecting Alaska consumers.
