#### Statements on inflation's impact on consumers

**Nick Begich III Attributed Alaska's Higher Inflation Rate to Essential Costs in 2024** According to Kodiak Daily Mirror, "We experience inflation in Alaska at a higher rate than other states, because a higher percentage of our total family budget is going toward housing, energy and food, and in those areas we've seen the highest levels of inflation. So we're impacted more than other states," said Begich. \[Kodiak Daily Mirror, [6/4/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C5Y-7BH1-JBCN-3157-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
