# Controversies and Public Perception Surrounding Wealth

### Summary

-   In 2024, Mary Peltola's campaign accused Nick Begich III of profiting from a company that sold "phony medical devices" to seniors, raising concerns about his business practices and wealth sources ([Alaska Public Media](https://alaskapublic.org/2024/10/10/that-ad-claiming-begich-sold-phony-medical-devices-heres-the-backstory/)).

-   Begich publicly pledged in 2024 to distance himself from his investments if elected, stating he would have no direct involvement in trading or managing those assets ([Daily Sitka Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6W-YCF1-DXVP-T3KW-00000-00&context=1519360); [Fairbanks Daily News-Miner](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6V-0DS1-JBCN-326Y-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   In 2022, Begich argued that his personal wealth would make him less reliant on special interest groups, suggesting it could help him remain independent as a member of Congress ([Alaska Dispatch News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65GC-35P1-DYTM-N00H-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich cited former Congressman Don Young's descriptions of financial strain faced by members of Congress, claiming his own resources would prevent similar struggles if elected ([Alaska Dispatch News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65GC-35P1-DYTM-N00H-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Allegations of benefiting from questionable business ventures and outsourcing jobs overseas highlight ongoing public scrutiny and potential vulnerabilities in Begich's wealth and business background.

### Criticism Related to Campaign Funding

#### Public Reactions to Wealth

**2024: Peltola Campaign Alleged Begich Profited From Company Selling** '**Phony Medical Devices**' **To Seniors** According to Alaska Public Media, "First, he hired workers in India instead of Alaska to make himself rich. Now we learn he cashed in with an online company that pushed phony medical devices to seniors." \[Alaska Public Media, [10/10/24](https://alaskapublic.org/2024/10/10/that-ad-claiming-begich-sold-phony-medical-devices-heres-the-backstory/)\]

### Conflict of Interest Concerns

#### Transparency of Financial Dealings

**Begich Pledged To Distance Himself From Investments If Elected In 2024** According to The Daily Sitka Sentinel, 'If elected, Begich said, he would take his hands off those investments. "I would not want to be involved in trading any of that. If that's happening, it would be happening at arms' length from me, as I think it should be for all members of Congress," he said.' \[Daily Sitka Sentinel, [10/15/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6W-YCF1-DXVP-T3KW-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

#### Links to Special Interests

**2024: Nick Begich III Pledged To Maintain Separation From Investments If Elected** According to Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, "If elected, Begich said, he would take his hands off those investments. 'I would not want to be involved in trading any of that. If that's happening, it would be happening at arms' length from me, as I think it should be for all members of Congress,' he said." \[Fairbanks Daily News-Miner (Alaska), [10/17/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6V-0DS1-JBCN-326Y-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2022: Begich Asserted His Wealth Insulated Him From Special Interest Influence** According to Alaska Dispatch News, "Begich also argues that his wealth itself - not just his experience accumulating it - would be helpful if he was elected. His assets, he said, insulate him from dependence on special interests or particular groups of supporters, and ensure he won't be struggling to maintain homes in Alaska and Washington." \[Alaska Dispatch News, [5/17/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65GC-35P1-DYTM-N00H-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2022: Begich Cited Don Young's Description Of Congressional Living Conditions As Evidence Of Financial Strain On Representatives** According to Alaska Dispatch News, "He said that Young, the former congressman, once described how dozens of representatives sleep in their offices at the U.S. Capitol. 'That's emblematic of an issue that is unsustainable: It taxes the member in a way that makes it difficult for them to do great work, if they're worried about their personal finances,' Begich said." \[Alaska Dispatch News, [5/17/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65GC-35P1-DYTM-N00H-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
