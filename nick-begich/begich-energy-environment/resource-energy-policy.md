# Resource Development and Energy Policy

### Summary

-   Begich's aggressive opposition to federal regulations and executive orders---often using inflammatory language---may alienate moderate voters and escalate partisan divides. ([Anchorage Daily News, 1/6/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DV3-T063-RSSN-54XC-00000-00), [Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, 1/7/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DV9-RX63-RRYY-G47X-00000-00))

-   Repeatedly made factually incorrect or misleading claims, particularly about the link between Biden's offshore drilling ban and Cook Inlet gas supply, undermining trust in his arguments. ([Anchorage Daily News, 1/18/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DXN-Y2S3-RRKJ-N4NK-00000-00), [Bristol Bay Times & Dutch Harbor Fisherman, 1/9/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DVC-CYC3-S1VW-K4MX-00000-00))

-   Near-unconditional support for controversial projects (like Pebble Mine) and opposition to preemptive environmental vetoes could spark backlash from conservation groups and moderate Alaskans. ([Daily Sitka Sentinel, 10/24/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D91-N3M1-DXVP-T4GR-00000-00))

-   Relentless criticism of renewable energy and climate-related policies, using terms like "green religion," may hinder support from voters who favor a balanced or forward-looking energy approach. ([Anchorage Daily News, 2/13/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F43-H1D3-RXTD-V2DR-00000-00))

-   Publicly tying Alaska's resource policy and political future almost exclusively to Republican or Trump administration priorities could weaken cross-aisle and bipartisan appeal, limiting broader coalition-building opportunities. ([Kodiak Daily Mirror, 1/21/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DYD-MFW3-RWJD-F51K-00000-00), [Juneau Empire, 2/13/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F43-H1D3-RXTD-V2DR-00000-00))
