# Childhood Environment

### Summary

-   Nick Begich and three others disappeared in 1972 after their Cessna 310 plane went missing, prompting a massive 39-day search operation by multiple U.S. agencies and civilians, but neither the wreckage nor the occupants were ever found ([Kids.kiddle.co](https://kids.kiddle.co/Nick_Begich)).

-   The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the missing plane did not have an Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), making the search more difficult ([Kids.kiddle.co](https://kids.kiddle.co/Nick_Begich)).

-   Nick Begich's disappearance has remained a mystery and a source of speculation for decades due to the lack of physical evidence.

-   In 2020, iHeartMedia's "Missing in Alaska" podcast revisited the case, exploring various conspiracy theories, such as possible FBI or mob involvement in the disappearance ([Kids.kiddle.co](https://kids.kiddle.co/Nick_Begich)).

-   The absence of an ELT and the remote Alaskan wilderness increased the vulnerability of the search and rescue operation, reducing the likelihood of finding the aircraft or survivors.
