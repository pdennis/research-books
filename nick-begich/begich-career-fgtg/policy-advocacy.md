# Policy Advocacy and Legislative Positions

### Summary

-   Begich has reversed or softened positions on Social Security, previously likening it to a "Ponzi scheme" before declaring himself a "100%, full supporter" ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5M-YN31-DXVP-T0B5-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He campaigned as a staunch conservative critical of bipartisan moves and government spending, but has since celebrated his own bipartisan legislative achievements and inherited bills from Democrat Mary Peltola ([Anchorage Daily News](https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/04/22/nick-begich-iii-is-first-to-receive-alaska-republican-party-endorsement-in-crowded-us-house-race/), [Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F2S-FBH3-RSMD-M4XP-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Emphasis on resource extraction aligns closely with Trump-era priorities, which may be out of step with evolving public concerns around climate and environment ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DC0-CST1-JBCN-330F-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich's strong association with the Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) caucus and rapid federal downsizing (linked to Elon Musk and Trump) may alienate constituents affected by government cutbacks or those concerned about protecting services ([Juneau Empire](https://www.juneauempire.com/news/begich-supports-trumps-federal-cutbacks-but-i-recognize-the-process-wont-be-perfect/)).

-   His shift from criticizing federal spending in earlier campaigns to applauding large federal infrastructure packages could be perceived as inconsistent or opportunistic ([Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:646R-C661-JD2C-J03Y-00000-00&context=1519360), [Press Release](https://begich.house.gov/media/press-releases)).

-   Begich faces scrutiny for frequently introducing or passing legislation initially crafted by other politicians, raising questions about originality and legislative leadership ([Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F2S-FBH3-RSMD-M4XP-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arctic Sounder](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F3V-HRP3-RV7F-P0X8-00000-00&context=1519360)).
