# Economic Development and Resource Policy

### Summary

-   Nick Begich consistently supports expansive resource development in Alaska, advocating for oil, gas, mining, timber, and infrastructure projects to drive economic growth and generational wealth for Alaskans ([Anchorage Daily News](https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/05/03/qa-with-alaska-us-house-candidate-nick-begich/), [Fairbanks Daily News-Miner](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5J-52Y1-DXVP-T0WY-00000-00&context=1519360), [Homer News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5Y-1RH3-RS1X-H2CC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He emphasizes reducing federal regulations and review processes that he argues hamper resource development, while opposing policies like carbon capture and the Jones Act that he views as limiting economic opportunity ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D7X-BBK1-DXVP-T4DN-00000-00&context=1519360), [Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D7R-DTS1-JD2C-J088-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Infrastructure improvements---such as natural gas pipelines, Ambler Road, and enhanced transportation---are a central part of Begich's approach to foster economic diversification, lower costs, and make rural regions more accessible ([Fairbanks Daily News-Miner](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5G-GT43-RRKG-M2WG-00000-00&context=1519360), [Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6665-CB61-JD2C-J4GW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich promotes Alaska's role in supplying critical minerals and energy to the nation, arguing the state can do so more ethically and responsibly than international competitors like China and Russia ([Fairbanks Daily News-Miner](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66K4-1581-DXVP-V1JW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerability: Some critics and observers note concerns that a rapid expansion of resource development or poorly structured approvals (as under some recent federal administrations) could lead to legal or environmental setbacks for key projects ([Bristol Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DMD-6RP1-JBCN-33DN-00000-00&context=1519360)).
