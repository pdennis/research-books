# Voting Rights and Election Integrity

### Summary

-   Nick Begich repeatedly questioned the legitimacy and fairness of the 2020 presidential election, citing concerns about censorship, election procedure changes, and a general "crisis of confidence" in the system, but stopped short of claiming the election was stolen ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D68-PCT1-DYRB-S2F1-00000-00&context=1519360), [Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5G-2K21-JD2C-J0CC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich acknowledges Joe Biden as president but maintains that the methods used to secure his victory---such as last-minute election rule changes and alleged suppression of free speech---were not legitimate ([Nome Nugget](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D78-RH01-JBCN-3525-00000-00&context=1519360), [NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5D-55C1-JBCN-33B1-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He is a vocal opponent of ranked choice voting, arguing that it adds confusion and does not reflect the will of voters, but has urged Republicans to use the system strategically via "rank the red" messaging ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPG-3W13-RTT2-11R5-00000-00&context=1519360), [Alaska Dispatch News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66T1-CTD1-JCBJ-Y2D9-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich supported the SAVE Act, which would impose new voting restrictions, despite concerns that it could disproportionately affect Alaskans ([Homer News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FKJ-KG03-RRSF-60MH-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Critics and letter writers have labeled Begich an "election denier" and noted his avoidance of directly affirming the 2020 election's legitimacy despite a lack of evidence for widespread fraud ([Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D8N-KYX1-F0HF-80TY-00000-00&context=1519360), [Alaska Dispatch News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6659-TK11-JCBJ-Y1J9-00000-00&context=1519360)).

Neither Begich nor Tshibaka answered the first question directly. Begich stated the obvious, that Biden is our president. He wrote obscurely about a 'crisis of confidence in our election systems' without revealing what the crisis is, where it came from, how it relates to Biden's election, or what he would do about it if elected." \[Letter to the Editor - Alaska Dispatch News, [8/14/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6659-TK11-JCBJ-Y1J9-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**October 2024: Begich Referred To Election Tactics As Unacceptable** According to Juneau Empire, 'I think it's worth looking at that. I think it's acceptable and reasonable for any American to question, hey, is this reasonable? Is this what we expect in a free and fair election?

These are the things that happened behind the scenes,' Begich said." \[NBC - 2 KTUU (Anchorage, Alaska), [10/11/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5D-55C1-JBCN-33B1-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2022: Don Canning Highlighted Nick Begich's Defeat Under Ranked Choice Voting** According to an opinion piece by Don Canning in Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, "In 2022 the first year that it was used in Alaska Mary Peltola won the special election for the vacant U.S. House seat, even though the combined totals of Nick Begich's and Sarah Palin's votes would have beaten Peltola if Palin had been knocked out in the second round and her second-choice votes had gone to Begich. That was complicated, but, trust me, it's true. Ranked choice failed, in other words, to pick what voting experts call a 'Condorcet winner' meaning a winner who would win with a majority in any two-way match-up with any other candidate in that race." \[Don Canning - Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, [11/3/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBF-MWD1-DXVP-T4VM-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

But during his very short tenure he has shown himself to be in lockstep with the current administration." \[Marylou Burton - Homer News, [4/17/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FKJ-KG03-RRSF-60MH-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**August 2022: Begich Participated In Election Under Alaska's New Ranked Choice Voting System** According to Anchorage Press, "Vote for one candidate in each race in the primary. The flip side of the ballot which contains the special general election for the U.S. House allows you to rank the three candidates in whatever order you choose. They are Sarah Palin, Nick Begich and Mary Peltola." \[Anchorage Press, [8/3/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6631-Y5P1-JBCN-453K-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**August 2022: Nick Begich III Was Likely To Be Eliminated In Ranked Choice Voting Tabulation** According to Alaska Dispatch News, "Begich is trailing behind Palin and not likely to catch up.

Lottsfeldt calls that 'the million-dollar question.'" \[Alaska Dispatch News, [8/17/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:666K-MM21-DYTM-N1J6-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
