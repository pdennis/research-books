**October 2024: Begich Stated 2020 Election Required Examining Speech Suppression And COVID Procedures** According to Anchorage Daily News, "Begich went on to claim that censorship of Google and social media had suppressed free speech. He argued that last-minute changes to election procedures were administered 'under the guide of COVID' restrictions in a number of swing states, and said, 'I think it's worth looking at that.'" \[Anchorage Daily News (Alaska), [10/11/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5M-YN31-DXVP-T0B5-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
