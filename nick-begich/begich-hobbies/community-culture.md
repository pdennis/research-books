**October 2022: Begich Reported Reading Financial News For Leisure During Campaign** According to Juneau Empire (Alaska), "For the last year, I've been working every single day of this campaign. I don't think I've had a day off. But when I do get a few minutes sometimes I'll jump online and read financial news. Believe it or not that's leisure reading for me right now and trying to keep track of what's going on in the economy is almost a full-time time job in itself." \[Juneau Empire (Alaska), [10/27/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66R3-K571-JD2C-J1MT-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
