# Science, Technology, and Infrastructure

### Summary

-   Gaps in Alaska's aviation safety and weather monitoring expose remote areas to higher risks, with calls for improved system redundancy indicating existing vulnerabilities ([NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5B-GTC3-RW88-932C-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Infrastructure instability in the Railbelt grid and concerns about DOGE-related blackouts highlight weaknesses in Alaska's power and energy resilience ([NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5T-RXC3-S2SM-C29G-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Slow adoption and bureaucratic barriers around fisheries' electronic monitoring technology could undermine efforts to sustainably manage Alaska's fisheries ([Kodiak Daily Mirror](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FKR-YH83-RSKV-M53V-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Lack of comprehensive oversight and regulation of technology platforms and personal data use poses risks to privacy, free speech, and self-determination ([Alaska Dispatch News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:663P-1401-DYTM-N334-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Congressional focus on national technology issues, such as a bitcoin reserve, may prompt criticism that local Alaska infrastructure needs are being set aside for broader agendas ([Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMB-D243-RRHF-62DG-00000-00&context=1519360)).

### Investment in Fisheries and Maritime Infrastructure

#### Federal Funding for Maritime Growth

**2025: Nick Begich Welcomed FAA \$25 Million Alaska Aviation Safety Investment** According to a press release from Representative Nick Begich's office, "U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski, and Congressman Nick Begich (all R-Alaska) today welcomed a \$25 million investment in Alaska aviation safety by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as part of the FAA's Don Young Alaska Aviation Safety Initiative (DYAASI)." \[Press Release - Representative Nick Begich Alaska at Large, [4/10/25](https://begich.house.gov/media/press-releases)\]

#### Support for Young Fisherman's Development Act

**October 2024: Begich Supported Research And Technology To Reduce Fisheries Bycatch** According to Bristol Bay Times & Dutch Harbor Fisherman, "Begich and Peltola each advocated measures to reduce bycatch, the unwanted fish caught while fishermen target another species. \[...\] Peltola and Begich each said they support additional research and technology development to limit bycatch." \[Bristol Bay Times & Dutch Harbor Fisherman, [10/17/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6F-5X01-JBCN-31G5-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

#### Technology in Commercial Fishing

**2025: Nick Begich Advocated For Electronic Monitoring Reforms In Alaska Fisheries** According to Kodiak Daily Mirror, "Another major area of focus is federal-level and technology and fisheries, especially electronic monitoring. \[...\] We need to streamline electronic monitoring approvals, removing the complex exemption process that slows adoption." \[Kodiak Daily Mirror (Alaska), [4/18/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FKR-YH83-RSKV-M53V-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Waterways and Naval Presence

#### National Security and Scientific Research in the Arctic

**2025: Begich Called For Improved Redundancy In Alaska Aviation Weather Monitoring Systems** In an interview with Alaska's News Source, Nick Begich said, "We need redundancy in power systems, redundancy in connectivity and redundancy in the cameras themselves in order to reduce the likelihood that they go down. When a pilot flying through a remote area of Alaska isn't certain about the weather, they're taking undue risks and so that's something that can be improved relatively quickly." \[Interview - Nick Begich with NBC - 2 KTUU (Anchorage, Alaska), [2/19/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5B-GTC3-RW88-932C-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**February 2025: Begich Addressed DOGE-Related Blackout Concerns In Legislative Session** According to NBC - 2 KTUU, "Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, addressed multiple DOGE questions from state lawmakers over the impact of firings and federal funding freezes on Alaska during his first address to a joint session of lawmakers, the congressman acknowledged he is working to address potential Railbelt power gird blackout concerns." \[NBC - 2 KTUU, [2/21/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5T-RXC3-S2SM-C29G-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**February 2025: Begich Confirmed Conversations On Railbelt Grid Resiliency Projects** According to NBC - 2 KTUU, '"I'm aware of those projects and programs, there are a number of them that we've already started having conversations on, especially as it relates to Railbelt grid resiliency," Begich said.' \[NBC - 2 KTUU, [2/21/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5T-RXC3-S2SM-C29G-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Digital Policy and Election Technology

#### Claims Regarding Technology Companies and Election Interference

**Begich's Campaign Attributed Out-of-State Contributions To National Legislative Agenda In 2025** According to Anchorage Daily News, "Paul Smith, a Begich campaign spokesperson, attributed Begich's out-of-state support to his legislative agenda. Begich has taken up national issues in Congress, including with a bill to establish a national bitcoin reserve." \[Anchorage Daily News, [4/20/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMB-D243-RRHF-62DG-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2022: Begich Called For Regulation Of Data Practices And Technology Platform Power** According to Alaska Dispatch News, "Large technology firms today hold tremendous amounts of information on each citizen: voter records, asset ownership, credit history, likes and preferences, and even purchase history. This largely unregulated data marketplace allows Americans' private information to be bought and sold, managed and monitored, and used to drive consumer behavior at unprecedented levels. Further, technology platforms are in a position to control the flow of information, to solely deem what they believe to be true, and influence the ability of those with whom they may disagree to reach an audience. This abuse of platform power threatens fundamental rights of self-determination and speech and must be curtailed in order to ensure we remain a truly free people." \[Alaska Dispatch News, [8/6/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:663P-1401-DYTM-N334-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
