**2024: Nick Begich Advocated For Cryptocurrency As A Financial Safeguard Against Congressional Spending** According to NBC - 2 KTUU (Anchorage, Alaska), "the business owner, whose campaigned on digital money potentially protecting what he calls 'America's financial sovereignty,' said it could provide an important contingency for Congress's lack of spending discipline \[...\] 'It's important to have a backup plan,' Begich said. 'I think the cryptocurrency can provide that. \[...\] I think offers a great alternative in the long run, should Congress continue to abuse the dollar.'" \[NBC - 2 KTUU (Anchorage, Alaska), [10/11/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5D-55C1-JBCN-33B1-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
