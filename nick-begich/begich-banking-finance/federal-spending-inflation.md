### Summary

-   He attributed rising inflation to government overspending, federal stimulus policies, and the Federal Reserve's expansion of the money supply ("money printing") ([Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66R3-K571-JD2C-J1MT-00000-00&context=1519360), [Alaska Dispatch News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:663P-1401-DYTM-N334-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Begich strongly opposed Democratic proposals to tax unrealized capital gains and increase corporate income tax rates, labeling such policies as "socialist or communist" ([Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CV8-PY41-DXVP-T11W-00000-00&context=1519360), [Daily Sitka Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CW3-8TR1-DXVP-T4S5-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He supported the extension of Trump-era federal tax cuts, positioning himself as a fiscal conservative committed to restraining government growth ([News Miner](https://www.newsminer.com/news/politics/nick-begich-iii-seeks-house-seat/article_ac4ef612-97b9-11ef-9bc2-13016b740aa6.html), [Daily Sitka Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5M-47Y1-DXVP-T339-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   In 2025, Begich proposed funding federal Bitcoin purchases by using surplus remittances from the Federal Reserve, illustrating his willingness to pursue alternative fiscal strategies ([Begich Campaign Press Release](https://begich.house.gov/media/press-releases/icymi-congressman-nick-begich-introduces-bitcoin-act-establish-strategic)).

-   Potential vulnerability: Begich's stance against federal spending comes alongside support for "hard investments on infrastructure," which may raise questions about balancing fiscal restraint with funding for necessary projects ([Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66P1-R5C1-F0HF-82J6-00000-00&context=1519360)).

And the root cause of inflation today is government spending financed by a Federal Reserve that's built a \$9 trillion balance sheet. If you want to get inflation under control we have to start producing again and we need to make sure government spending is under control, the government's put back in its lane, and the private sector is not vilified as it has been under Democrats and the Biden administration." \[Juneau Empire (Alaska), [10/27/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66R3-K571-JD2C-J1MT-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
