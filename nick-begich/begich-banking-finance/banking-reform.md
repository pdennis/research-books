# Banking System Reform and Regulatory Policy

### Summary

-   Congressman Nick Begich introduced the Bitcoin Act of 2025, aiming to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and codify a prior executive order from President Trump ([source](https://begich.house.gov/media/press-releases/icymi-congressman-nick-begich-introduces-bitcoin-act-establish-strategic)).

-   The proposed legislation would direct the U.S. Treasury to acquire up to 5% of the global bitcoin supply---around 1 million bitcoins over five years, valued at approximately \$80 billion at present prices ([source](https://begich.house.gov/media/press-releases/icymi-congressman-nick-begich-introduces-bitcoin-act-establish-strategic)).

-   The bill includes a requirement that government-held bitcoins cannot be sold for at least 20 years, emphasizing the intent for the reserve to be a long-term strategic asset ([source](https://begich.house.gov/media/press-releases/icymi-congressman-nick-begich-introduces-bitcoin-act-establish-strategic)).

-   Begich's effort seeks to make the strategic Bitcoin reserve permanent through congressional action, rather than relying solely on executive orders which can be reversed by future presidents ([source](https://begich.house.gov/media/press-releases/icymi-congressman-nick-begich-introduces-bitcoin-act-establish-strategic)).

-   Begich has a track record of advocating for cryptocurrency innovation and deregulation, including an endorsement from HODLPAC in 2022 for supporting financial systems based on individual sovereignty and reduced central control ([source](https://www.alaskansfornickbegich.com/solutions)).

-   Potential vulnerabilities include the concentration of national wealth in a highly volatile digital asset, and possible challenges regarding oversight, security, and the long-term impact on monetary policy.
