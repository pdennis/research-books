# Legislative and Policy Positions

### Summary

-   Nick Begich has consistently opposed allowing transgender women to compete in women's sports, stating his support for bans and emphasizing biological sex differences ([Juneau Empire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D7R-DTS1-JD2C-J088-00000-00&context=1519360), [Daily Sitka Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D91-N3M1-DXVP-T4FY-00000-00&context=1519360), [Anchorage Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D7X-BBK1-DXVP-T4DN-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He has publicly rejected Title IX regulations intended to protect transgender athletes, arguing these policies undermine women's sports and "ignore scientific fact" ([Fairbanks Daily News-Miner](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6598-X7H1-JBCN-421W-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   In multiple public forums, Begich received standing ovations for statements asserting that "men are men and women are women," using this rhetoric to clarify his policy stance ([Alaska Dispatch News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6597-3SG1-DYTM-N4PP-00000-00&context=1519360), [Fairbanks Daily News-Miner](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65MF-N571-DXVP-V0WC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   When clarifying his views in October 2024, Begich stated he does not think all transgender athletes should be banned from sports, but specifically opposes "men competing in women's sports" ([NBC - 2 KTUU](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D7R-V2H1-JBCN-32WB-00000-00&context=1519360)), highlighting a specific focus on competitive gender categories.

-   His stance is a potential vulnerability, as it situates him in the ongoing national debate over transgender rights and may energize both supporters and critics depending on the political climate.

-   Begich's language and policy positions have been publicly reported since at least 2022, showing a long-standing consistency in his legislative priorities on this issue ([USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/29/who-is-nick-begich-alaska-house-seat/10347524002/)).
