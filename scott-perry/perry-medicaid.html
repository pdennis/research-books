<h2>Perry Repeatedly Voted To Take Health Coverage From Pennsylvanians</h2>
<h3>2025: Perry Voted Three Times to Take Health Coverage Away from Pennsylvanians</h3>
<h4>July 2025: Perry Voted For The Final Version Of The Republican Reconciliation Bill</h4>
<p><strong>July 2025: Perry Voted For The Senate FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Extended $4 Trillion In Expiring Tax Cuts, Added New Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025, Perry voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, the “motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214.

  <li><strong>The Congressional Budget Office Estimated That 11.8 Million People Would Become Uninsured As A Result Of The Medicaid Cuts In Republicans’ Reconciliation Bill.</strong> According to the Washington Post, "The bill, which narrowly passed the Senate on Tuesday and now heads back to the House, would effectively accomplish what Republicans have long failed to do: unwind many of the key components of the ACA, President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement, which dramatically increased the number of Americans with access to health insurance. To start, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Senate version of the bill would result in 11.8 million more uninsured in 2034, mostly because of Medicaid cuts, compared with 10.9 million if the House version became law."

<h4>May 2025: Perry Voted In Favor Of House Republicans’ Reconciliation Bill, Which Cut Medicaid</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Perry Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Included $3.8 Trillion In Tax Cuts Offset By $1.5 Trillion In Spending Reductions To Programs Like Medicaid And The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</strong> In May 2025, Perry voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would provide for approximately $3.8 trillion in net tax cuts and $321 billion in military, border enforcement and judiciary spending, offset by $1.5 trillion in spending reductions, as instructed in the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). It would raise the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion and provide for increased spending on defense and border security, spending cuts on social safety net programs, such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It also includes a mix of tax breaks for businesses and individuals; tax increases on universities and foundations; and a phase-down of clean energy tax credits. […] It would reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by requiring states to shoulder more of the cost, expand work requirements for SNAP, extend programs authorized under the 2018 farm bill, and prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Program. As amended, it would cap state and local tax deductions at $40,000 for households with incomes below $500,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 215 to 214.

  <li><strong>The House GOP Budget Bill Was Estimated To Increase The Uninsured Population By 8.6 Million By 2034.</strong>&nbsp;According to CNN, “The Medicaid and Affordable Care Act provisions in the package could result in 8.6 million more people being uninsured in 2034, according to an early CBO estimate released by Democratic lawmakers. That number is expected to grow with the latest changes.” [CNN, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/what-is-in-trump-tax-spending-cuts-package">5/28/25</a>]</li>

<h4>February 2025: Perry Voted For House Republicans’ Budget Framework, Which Set Up Future Cuts To Medicaid</h4>
<p><strong>2/25/25: Perry Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Framework That Included $2 Trillion In Cuts, Raised The Statutory Debt Limit By $4 Trillion, And Required House Committees To Recommend Legislation That Would Implement Trump’s Agenda.</strong> In February 2025, Perry voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the concurrent resolution that would recommend a budget for fiscal 2025 and budget levels through fiscal 2034. The resolution would assume minimum savings of $1.5 trillion over 10 years and 2.6 percent economic growth over the same period. It also would require the statutory debt limit to be raised by $4 trillion. It also would authorize the House Ways and Means Committee to increase deficits by $4.5 trillion over 10 years to extend the 2017 tax cuts and implement new tax cuts proposed by the White House. It also would provide instructions for the budget reconciliation process through which separate legislation could be considered and passed in the Senate via a simple majority vote. The measure would deliver instructions to 11 House committees to report legislation that would implement President Donald Trump’s agenda, such as expanding tax cuts and bolstering border security and immigration enforcement. The committees would be required to report their legislative recommendations to the House Budget Committee by March 27, 2025. It also would set a $2 trillion target for the spending cuts to be submitted to the House Budget Committee. The resolution also would stipulate that if the committees don't reach that target, the Ways and Means’ reconciliation instructions to increase the deficit by a maximum of $4.5 trillion would be decreased by the amount the other committees come in below the target. Similarly, it would stipulate that Ways and Means could increase the deficit above the $4.5 trillion level by the amount of savings the committees achieve above the $2 trillion target.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 217 to 215.

  <li><strong>New York Times Reported The $880 Billion In Cuts Required By The Republican Budget Proposal Would Have To Come From Medicaid, Medicare, Or CHIP.</strong>&nbsp;According to the New York Times, "The budget resolution itself is silent on whether Congress cuts Medicaid, which provides health coverage to 72 million poor and disabled Americans. But it instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the program, to cut spending by $880 billion over the next decade. If the committee can’t save at least that much, the entire effort could be imperiled because of the special process Congress is using to avoid a Senate filibuster. Ten other committees have their own instructions to follow, though none have been assigned with cutting nearly as much.&nbsp; It’s not so simple as finding the cuts elsewhere. The special process, known as budget reconciliation, means Republicans will have to find all $880 billion from within the Energy and Commerce Committee’s jurisdiction. That leaves them with fewer options than one might think. […] If Republicans want to avoid major cuts to Medicaid, the largest pot of available money is in the other big government health insurance program: Medicare. […] Even if the committee cuts everything that’s not health care to $0, it will still be more than $600 billion short.&nbsp; The committee could also save around $200 billion by eliminating the Children’s Health Insurance Program, but that option has not been raised by the budget committee or anyone in House leadership. […] Even if all of these cuts, revenues and rule cancellations from outside health care can pass muster, the committee will still be left with hundreds of billions of dollars to cut to hit its goal. Mathematically, the budget committee’s instructions mean the committee would need to make major cuts to either Medicare, Medicaid or both."

<h3>Perry Called Concern About Medicaid Cuts “Desperate, Fearmongering Propaganda”</h3>
<p><strong>Perry Called Concerns About Medicaid Cuts “Desperate, Fearmongering Propaganda” Spread By The Liberal Media.</strong>&nbsp;According to Keystone, "In his response to Bussard, Perry blamed the liberal media for spreading ‘desperate, fearmongering propaganda.’ ‘that he and other Republicans intend to ‘destroy or dismantle’ Medicare or Medicaid. ‘To be clear, I do not now, nor have I ever supported the dissolution of either program,’ the letter reads. He added ‘while reform is desperately needed, people have paid into these programs for years – and the people who need it most should get the help they need and the help their tax dollars have paid into. President Trump agrees with me on these programs, and any efforts from the Left to distort our positions are cruel, devious, and tiresome – at best.’ Elsewhere in the letter, Perry went on to blame former House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco)." [Keystone, <a href="https://keystonenewsroom.com/2025/05/27/scott-perry-medicaid-letter/">5/27/25</a>]</p>

  <li><strong>One Of Perry’s Constituents Reportedly Wrote Him Expressing Concern About House Republicans’ Proposed Medicaid Cuts.</strong>&nbsp;According to Keystone, "A constituent who cares for her disabled son speaks out about a letter she received from Scott Perry, who voted with the US House for cuts to Medicaid. ‘Callous and cold.’&nbsp; That’s how Paula Bussard, a Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, resident, described a recent response sent from US Congressman Scott Perry’s (R-York) office after advocating for Alex Bussard, her disabled son who relies on Medicaid. ‘ I’ve been reaching out to [Perry] for a number of months, and I started with telling Alex’s story because I think when you’re talking about billions it’s easy to lose sight of the people,’ Bussard told The Keystone in an interview.&nbsp; ‘ I’ve gotten a couple responses. This one though sent me over the edge. The others were boilerplate. ‘I’m not trying to hurt anybody or the deficit spent, our deficit is outta control or whatever.’&nbsp; Bussard, a retiree in her 70s, is Alex’s caregiver, along with her husband. He&nbsp; suffers from disabilities stemming from a brain tumor diagnosed at age 12.&nbsp; The radiation and other treatments left Alex with physical and cognitive issues as well as learning disabilities, but he was able to graduate from high school and work a part-time job. Alex qualified for Medicaid due to his ailments but suffered a serious setback in 2023 when he experienced a brain hemorrhage.&nbsp; &nbsp;‘[Alex] was  in the hospital for five months, including rehab.’ Bussard explained. ‘He has a tracheostomy. He has a PEG tube for feeding and his medicines, and he has a Foley catheter. His bladder stopped working. He’s not able to stand. He has pretty severe leg contractions and he doesn’t talk, and he has limited use of his right arm and very little use of his left arm.’ Bussard contacted Perry’s office multiple times, including following a telephone townhall in April, where he was allegedly spreading misinformation about Medicaid. She was unable to challenge him on his statements, because she wasn’t called on to speak even though her question was screened. She alleges that Perry stated that 25% of Medicaid spending was misspent and unnecessary." [Keystone, <a href="https://keystonenewsroom.com/2025/05/27/scott-perry-medicaid-letter/">5/27/25</a>]</li>

<p><strong>Perry Constituent Called His Response To Her Concerns About House Republicans’ Medicaid Cuts “Callous, And Cold And Disingenuous.”</strong>&nbsp;According to Keystone, “Bussard described Perry’s response as insincere and unfeeling. ‘ I just thought it was callous, and cold and disingenuous because Scott Perry’s always been a deficit hawk,’ Bussard said. ‘[Perry] extends tax cuts for very wealthy people and then blames the deficit on the healthcare needs of our country’s and his district’s most vulnerable.’&nbsp; Perry’s office did not respond to a request for comment."

<h3>Perry Claimed Medicaid Money Going to States Was “Money Laundering”</h3>

<p><strong>Perry Claimed Federal Money States Received For Medicaid Was “Money Laundering.”</strong> According to an interview Rep. Scott Perry gave on the Dom Giordano Program, “HOST: Yeah. And it's going to be more intense in the Senate. We were talking about as the negotiations were going on, that we know that Social Security and Medicare are the third rail. That's still very difficult. Has Medicaid become that now? Because your record would indicate you would see a chance here to really reform this. Instead, I don't think there's as much reform as we would like when it comes to Medicaid. PERRY: Not not nearly enough. I talked to some of my state colleagues who don't even realize we call it money laundering. The states are money laundering money from the federal government. But here's the situation. We have to do it. It's bankrupting the federal government.” [The Dom Giordano Program, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/scott-perry-the-dom-giordano-program-5302025/s-npZJ0SnDGRg?si=f46d5b04fa2f4baa81dc798952100075&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">5/30/25</a>] (audio)</p>
<p><strong>Perry Claimed States Used Federal Medicaid Funding As A “Money Laundering Situation.”</strong>&nbsp;According to an interview Rep. Scott Perry gave on Fox 43, “PERRY: Number two, Medicaid was created for the poor, people that are struggling, that may be infirm, a pregnant mother who has to care for her child and can't work, something like that. Unfortunately, the states are using it as kind of a money laundering situation where the people that the program was meant for are waiting in line because the federal government is paying seven times that rate that they would pay for them for people that are able bodied without dependents, able bodied, without dependents. That's the biggest majority of Medicaid patients now. It wasn't meant for people that could work but choose not to. It was meant for people that are poor or can't work. And so we're going to preserve it. We want to, if we want to preserve it for the people that it was intended for, we've got to get rid of some of this waste.” [Fox 43, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ2o0bbYHtQ">5/28/25</a>] (video)</p>

<p><strong>Perry Said He “Reluctantly” Voted For The House Republican Reconciliation Bill Because He Thought It Spent Too Much Money And Needed To Go Further On Cuts.</strong>&nbsp;According to a legislative update posted by Rep. Scott Perry, “PERRY: The one big beautiful bill, as it is called, is working its way through the Senate. I know they had a meeting on it today. I don't know where, what they've come to on that. As you know, I'm seeking pretty robust changes to that. I you know, I reluctantly voted for it. There's a lot of great things in it, but it spends too much money. And I think we must and can go a lot further to make sure that we're not bankrupting the country and bankrupting its citizens. And we're hoping that the Senate's going to deal with some of those things.” [Rep. Scott Perry Legislative Update, <a href="https://youtu.be/fn3CjyjjzKY">6/17/25</a>] (video)</p>
<p><strong>Perry Was Reportedly Part Of A Group Of House Republicans Urging Senate Republicans To Make Deeper Spending Cuts In The Reconciliation Bill And Maintain The Rollback Of Clean Energy Tax Credits.</strong>&nbsp;According to Politico, "For example, Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.) is meeting with Senate GOP leadership staff Wednesday to discuss the House’s proposed increase to the SALT cap ahead of the Senate vote. Meanwhile, House GOP rebels Chip Roy (R-Texas) and Scott Perry (R-Pa.) met with Senate GOP fiscal hawks Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) on Tuesday night as they push the Senate to carve out deeper spending cuts and maintain the House’s rollback of clean energy tax credits."

<p><strong>Perry Seemed To Lament That House Republicans’ Reconciliation Bill Did Not Cut Enough Spending And Said, “When It Comes To Walking The Walk And Making Real Cuts, The Swamp Folded."</strong> According to a post on Twitter from Rep. Scott Perry, "I voted for the imperfect ‘One BBB’ after fighting tirelessly with the&nbsp; @freedomcaucus for weeks. @elonmusk is right: everyone likes to talk the DOGE talk, but when it comes to walking the walk and making real cuts, the Swamp folded."

<p><strong>Perry Said He Wished The House Reconciliation Bill Was More Aggressive On Spending Cuts For Medicaid And Clean Energy Tax Credits.</strong> According to the Daily Signal, "‘My biggest reservations, quite honestly, generally still remain,’ he told The Daily Signal shortly after voting for the budget reconciliation bill. ‘All the savings happen in the 10-year window, but of course, as always in Washington D.C., at the end of the ten-year window.’ Specifically, Perry wishes the bill had more aggressively reformed Medicaid and Biden-era green energy tax credits to cut spending and calm already uneasy bond markets."

  <li><strong>Perry Said More Extreme Spending Cuts In The Reconciliation Bill Were Directly Due To His And The House Freedom Caucus’ Efforts.</strong> According to the Daily Signal, "Despite calling his ‘yes’ on reconciliation, a ‘tough vote,’ Perry is proud of how he and his caucus shaped the entire process.&nbsp; ‘We pushed as hard as we could. We improved the bill and process immensely,’ he said. ‘You recognize and realize the Republican conference went [on retreat] to Doral in Florida and came back with a recommendation of $30 billion in spending cuts? And now we’re at what—1.6 or 1.7 [trillion]… and those are directly due to the efforts of the Freedom Caucus.’" [Daily Signal, <a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/05/22/skeptic-big-beautiful-bill-tells-all-last-minute-negotiations/">5/22/25</a>]</li>
