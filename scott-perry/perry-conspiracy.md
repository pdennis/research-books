### Perry Has Spread the Antisemitic and Anti-Immigrant “Great Replacement Theory”

**Perry In 2021: “For Many Americans What Seems To Be Happening Or What They Believe Right Now Is Happening Is, What Appears To Them Is We’re Replacing National-Born American — Native-Born Americans To Permanently Transform The Political Landscape Of This Very Nation.”** According to the Washington Post, "A subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee was meeting to examine the root causes of migration from Central American countries that make up a disproportionate portion of migrants seeking to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. The State Department’s envoy to the region, Ricardo Zúniga, was offering testimony on the subject when Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) was given the floor. \[…\] ‘For many Americans,’ Perry began, ‘what seems to be happening or what they believe right now is happening is, what appears to them is we’re replacing national-born American — native-born Americans to permanently transform the political landscape of this very nation.’" \[Washington Post, [4/14/21](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/04/14/tucker-carlsons-toxic-replacement-rhetoric-gets-picked-up-house/)\]

-   **Southern Poverty Law Center Said The “Great Replacement Theory” Was “Inherently White Supremacist” And Antisemitic.** According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, "The ‘great replacement’ theory is inherently white supremacist. It depends on stoking fears that a non-white population, which the theory’s proponents characterize as ‘inferior,’ will displace a white majority. It is also antisemitic. Some proponents of the ‘great replacement’ do not explicitly attribute the plot to Jews. Instead, they blame powerful Jewish individuals such as financier and philanthropist George Soros or use coded antisemitic language to identify shadowy ‘elites’ or ‘globalists.’" \[Southern Poverty Law Center, [5/17/22](https://www.splcenter.org/resources/hatewatch/racist-great-replacement-conspiracy-theory-explained/)\]

-   **Perry Reportedly Claimed “We’re Importing People Into The Country That Want To Be In America… But Have No Interest In Being Americans.”** According to CNN, "While Perry said he is happy to accept people ‘that are here legally,’ pointing to his ancestors who migrated to the US, he has an issue with migrants that are ‘un-American.’  ‘What is happening now is we’re importing people into the country that want to be in America … but have no interest in being Americans, and that’s very different and to disparage the comments is to chill the conversation so that we can continue to bring in more people that we never met that are un-American,’ Perry said, according to the recording." \[CNN, [5/8/24](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/scott-perry-closed-door-comments?cid=ios_app)\]
