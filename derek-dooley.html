<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>How To Win Against Derek Dooley</strong></h1>
<p>Derek Dooley is a nepo baby who couldn’t win as a football coach for Georgia’s arch-rival Tennessee, or anywhere else he went. He was eager to strip away Georgians’ health care and cheered Trump as he decimated Georgia’s economy. Dooley has failed upwards his entire career and has a knack for saying idiotic things.</p>
<h3><strong>Dooley Endangered Georgians’ Health Care</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dooley <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/12/how-georgia-democrats-pulled-off-a-special-election-stunner/"><u>mocked</u></a> the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium subsidies as “<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/12/the-senate-vote-on-health-subsidies-sets-up-georgias-2026-race/"><u>a mess</u></a>” and “<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/12/the-senate-vote-on-health-subsidies-sets-up-georgias-2026-race/"><u>band-aids on bullet holes</u></a>;” he opposed their extension.&nbsp; An estimated <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/2025/09/report-georgia-health-sector-to-lose-37b-in-2026-as-aca-subsidies-end/"><u>460,000 Georgians</u></a> could lose their health insurance without the subsidies and Georgians expected their health care premiums to <a href="https://roughdraftatlanta.com/2025/12/12/rising-aca-costs-georgia/"><u>more than double</u></a>.</li>
  <li>Dooley was a do-nothing on reproductive freedom and wanted to “<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/08/derek-dooley-casts-himself-as-the-senate-outsider-who-can-win/"><u>stay out of</u></a>” the fight for reproductive health care if elected to the Senate. He <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/9506dcc4-e39f-4297-af33-1b2ecfa6e553/s-WBXJ2lEh54C?si=1394be65efc24f01885f5522989a1df9&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>didn’t care</u></a> that Georgia’s heartbeat law <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-abortion-ban-amber-thurman-death"><u>threatened women’s lives</u></a> and he <a href="https://youtu.be/Pp39A8Sminc"><u>praised</u></a> the Supreme Court’s overturning Roe v. Wade.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Message: </strong>Dooley<strong> </strong>would not protect Georgians and was prepared to let their health care prices skyrocket.</p>
<h3><strong>Dooley Supported The “Big Beautiful Bill” Which Harmed Georgians And The Georgia Economy</strong></h3>

</ul>
<p><strong>Message:</strong> Dooley was ready to betray Georgia and take health care away from Georgians all to fund billionaire tax breaks.</p>

  <li>Dooley was a “<a href="https://www.foxsports.com/stories/other/oral-history-of-the-derek-dooley-era-at-tennessee"><u>laughingstock</u></a>” as Tennessee head coach and was included on CBS Sports’ “<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/from-chad-morris-to-charlie-strong-college-footballs-top-25-worst-coaching-hires-this-century/"><u>25 worst coaching hires this century</u></a>.” Sports reporters thought Dooley was <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/stories/other/oral-history-of-the-derek-dooley-era-at-tennessee"><u>short-tempered</u></a> and “<a href="https://www.foxsports.com/stories/other/oral-history-of-the-derek-dooley-era-at-tennessee"><u>wasn’t good at relationships</u></a>.”</li>
  <li>Georgians were <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2025/07/03/bookman-trying-to-parlay-football-career-into-us-senate-run-is-a-tired-play-even-with-dooley-name/"><u>weary</u></a> of Dooley’s candidacy and his home county’s GOP chairman planned to “<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/08/kemps-latest-gamble-a-blank-slate-senate-candidate-with-big-stakes/"><u>take a pass on Derek Dooley</u></a>.” Attendees at Dooley’s events were <a href="https://www.mymcr.net/news/swice-as-good-do-any-georgia-republicans-want-to-beat-ossoff/article_ba4a5914-7968-4f05-a505-bea3d74e1efb.html"><u>unimpressed</u></a> with the candidate and Atlanta-area Tennessee fans were <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/09/what-tennessee-fans-think-of-their-old-coach-derek-dooley-running-for-us-senate/"><u>confused</u></a> by his entrance to the Senate race.</li>

<h3><strong>Dooley Said Dumb Things And Touted His Shaky Historical Knowledge</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dooley <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=5726924"><u>infamously compared</u></a> his Tennessee Volunteers to the Germans in World War II and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/derek-dooley-that-sec-football-podcast-82819/s-XpVIOFg7Z73?si=d790edc11e15437cb5fd8e5735346aef&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>misquoted Winston Churchill</u></a> in an impromptu history lecture. Dooley later defended his WWII analogy and ignored the nazi implications.</li>
  <li>In 2016, Dooley, whose <a href="https://www.wuga.org/local-news/2025-08-04/derek-dooley-son-of-the-late-vince-dooley-is-running-for-senate"><u>only accomplishment</u></a> was to be born the son of famous University of Georgia football coach Vince Dooley, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG-pZ29qKYQ"><u>declined to root for Georgia football</u></a> after his brief, and failed, tenure at Tennessee.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Message:</strong> Dooley loved to pretend he was the smartest person in the room and only removed the silver spoon from his mouth to replace it with a foot.</p>
<h3><strong>Dooley Couldn’t Be Bothered To Vote</strong></h3>
