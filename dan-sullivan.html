<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>How To Win Against Dan Sullivan</strong></h1>
<p>Dan Sullivan, a born-and-raised Ohioan, has voted time and time again to cut services for hard-working Alaskans and to endanger the lives of rural and native Alaskans. Sullivan voted for legislation that kicked tens of thousands of Alaskans off their health insurance, supported the elimination of funding for life-saving public broadcasting, defended tariffs that hurt the many small businesses that employ half of Alaska’s workforce, ignored Alaskan Natives opposing the opening of the NPR-A for development, and cut food assistance for hard-working Alaskans. Sullivan does not know what is best for Alaskan communities and shows it through his consistent votes against the Alaskan people.</p>
<h3><strong>Sullivan Voted For Devastating Health Care Cuts</strong></h3>
<p>Sullivan <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1191/vote_119_1_00372.htm"><u>voted</u></a> for the “One Big Beautiful Bill” that resulted in over <a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf"><u>37,000 Alaskans</u></a> losing health coverage. Sullivan claimed that Alaska was in <a href="https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2025/07/02/facing-snap-medicaid-concerns-why-murkwoski-sullivan-say-they-voted-big-beautiful-bill/"><u>“good shape”</u></a> regarding Medicaid funding following passage of the bill, calling it a “big win” for rural hospitals and healthcare. Sullivan <a href="https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-sen-sullivan-calls-for-end-to-the-schumer-shutdown"><u>applauded </u></a>the Rural Health Transformation Fund (RHTF) included in the bill as “huge for Alaska.” The Center For Medicaid And Medicare Services (CMS), however, <a href="https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2025/10/21/trump-administration-severely-limits-funding-for-rural-hospitals-and-clinics-from-rural-health-transformation-fund-capped-at-15/"><u>capped</u></a> usage of the $50 billion fund at 15% for health provider payments, including to rural hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>Message: </strong>Sullivan supported taking healthcare away from tens of thousands of Alaskans and jeopardized the health of rural Alaskans.</p>
<h3><strong>Sullivan Supported The Elimination Of Funding For Life-Saving Public Broadcasting</strong></h3>
<p>Sullivan <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1191/vote_119_1_00411.htm"><u>voted</u></a> for the 2025 rescissions package that reduced funding for public broadcasting by <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/01/nx-s1-5489808/cpb-shut-down-public-broadcasting-trump"><u>$1.1 billion</u></a> through fiscal year 2027. In Alaska, that Native-American initiated station KYUK received <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/14/nx-s1-5585941/alaska-typhoon-public-radio-funding"><u>70%</u></a> of its funding from the federal government. In the leadup and aftermath of Typhoon Halong, KYUK played a key role in warning primarily Yu’pik communities, many of whom speak Yugtun. With the loss of a little over <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/14/nx-s1-5585941/alaska-typhoon-public-radio-funding"><u>$1 million</u></a> in federal funding, however, KYUK was forced to reduce staff from 23 employees to 14 as well as cut a daily program to four days a week.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Message: </strong>Sullivan voted for legislation that would endanger the lives of rural and native Alaskans in times of emergency.</p>
<h3><strong>Sullivan Supported Tariffs That Endangered The Alaskan Economy</strong></h3>
<p>Sullivan <a href="https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2024/11/27/sen-sullivan-talks-with-alaskas-news-source-about-combatting-fentanyl-crisis-president-elect-trump/"><u>defended</u></a> Trump’s tariffs, claiming he was transparent about his tariff strategy throughout his campaign. With the <a href="https://www.whio.com/news/states-that-stand-be-most-impacted-by-tariffs/O2WG4YQSYROTPC2M3L7KF2XYF4/"><u>third highest export-to-import ratio in Alaska</u></a>, the state is more vulnerable to retaliatory tariffs than most of the country. <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/programs/alaska-economic-report/2025-04-24/despair-frustration-and-uncertainty-alaska-businesses-contend-with-trump-tariffs"><u>70%</u></a> of Alaskan small businesses, which employ <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/programs/alaska-economic-report/2025-04-24/despair-frustration-and-uncertainty-alaska-businesses-contend-with-trump-tariffs"><u>more than half of the state</u></a>,&nbsp; were forced to increase prices as a result of the tariffs.</p>
<p><strong>Message: </strong>Sullivan supported tariffs that hurt Alaskan small businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Sullivan Introduced Legislation That Opened The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska For Oil And Gas Leasing</strong></h3>
<p>Sullivan <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/80/all-actions"><u>introduced</u></a> a disapproval resolution that would rescind a Biden administration Integrated Activity Plan (IAP) that closed half of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) to oil and gas leasing. Following the passage of the resolution, an Iñupiat-aligned group, alongside conservation groups, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/lawsuit-challenges-the-approval-of-an-exploratory-drilling-program-in-alaska-petroleum-reserve/ar-AA1SbmFj?ocid=BingNewsBrowse"><u>sued</u></a> against the approval of an exploratory drilling program in the NPR-A. While Sullivan claimed the initial closure of the NPR-A was <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2025/10/29/senate-advances-resolution-against-biden-alaska-drilling-limits-00627296"><u>“cancelling native voices”</u></a>, Native Alaskan communities say oil and gas leasing would endanger their homelands, unity, and way of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Message: </strong>Sullivan ignored Native Alaskan voices that warned oil and gas leasing in the NPR-A would endanger their homes, unity, and way of life.</p>
<h3><strong>Sullivan Supported Cuts To Food Assistance For Alaskans</strong></h3>
<p>Sullivan <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1191/vote_119_1_00372.htm"><u>voted</u></a> for the “One Big Beautiful Bill” that contained the <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-senate-republican-leaderships-reconciliation-bill-takes"><u>largest cut</u></a> to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in history. Sullivan also <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/06/07/nothing-you-can-do-except-stand-here-public-assistance-office-keeps-alaskans-waiting/"><u>supported</u></a> work requirements for SNAP under the bill, which would disproportionately impact <a href="https://blog.foodbankofalaska.org/feeding-those-who-feed-us-through-snap"><u>20%</u></a> of the Alaskan workforce that are classified as seasonal workers.</p>
<p><strong>Message:&nbsp;</strong></p>
