<p><strong>Whatley Was Encouraged To Run By Senate Majority Leader Thune.&nbsp;</strong>According to Axios, “&nbsp;When it became clear Lara Trump would not run, Thune turned his attention to wooing Whatley, who was North Carolina GOP chair before Trump handpicked him to be the Republican National Committee chair last year.

<h3>Whatley Still Had Washington, DC Area Listed As His Location Of Employment On LinkedIn&nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>Whatley Stilled Listed His Location Of Employment As “Washington, District Of Columbia Area.”&nbsp;</strong>According to Wilson Times, “In fact, of Cooper and Whatley, Whatley has the more elitist resume. His LinkedIn page still lists his location of employment as the ‘Washington, District of Columbia area.’ Even Thom Tillis managed to lie about where he lived. Tillis, an IBM executive earning $500,000 a year, resides in Cornelius. Cornelius has a median income of over $100,000 and is 91% white. Thus, our senior senator found it necessary to claim he lived in Huntersville. Whatley, the real North Carolinian, has failed to update his tony professional hometown.” [Wilson Times, <a href="https://www.wilsontimes.com/columns/michael-whatleys-pseudo-populist-campaign-cdb1621c/">10/28/25</a>]</p>
