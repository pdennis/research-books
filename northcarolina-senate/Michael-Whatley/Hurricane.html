I mean, we’ve gotten 10% of our money in 365 days. There’s a lot of people still struggling.’” [Charlotte Observer, <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article312287473.html">9/27/25</a>]</p>

[…] In January, when Trump visited Western North Carolina, he said Whatley's role as the hurricane recovery ‘czar’ would be to help with recovery efforts and get money to the region. Those who attended the event on Monday, however, see it differently; They said they have not seen Whatley doing anything.” [WLOS, <a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/black-mountain-swannanoa-western-north-carolina-residents-michael-whatley-not-helping-hurricane-helene-recovery-czar-president-donald-trump-homeland-security-secretary-kristi-noem-congress-gop">9/8/25</a>]</p>

They said for months, they haven't seen him attend any meetings or do any kind of outreach to find out what people need, particularly with controversies around FEMA funds.” [WLOS (ABC), <a href="https://youtu.be/0MV_xarUkas">9/8/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>[VIDEO] North Carolina Residents Claimed That Whatley Was Not Doing Enough.&nbsp;</strong>“There is growing frustration in Western North Carolina as recovery efforts continue nearly a year after the remnants of Hurricane Helene. Today, dozens gathered at a brewery in Black Mountain to speak about the slow response to federal aid. They say Swannanoa has no functioning post office, and critical roads and bridges are barely passable. There are also few resources for groceries. They say they believe the man the president put in charge, Michael Whatley, is not doing enough.” [WXII (NBC), <a href="https://youtu.be/y3R71ULHmk0">9/8/25</a>]</li>

They say Swannanoa has no functioning post office, and residents have to drive 30 minutes to Asheville to pick up their mail. Critical roads and bridges are barely passable, and there are few resources for groceries. They blame the man President Trump put in charge, Michael Whatley.” [WITN-GRENC (NBC), <a href="https://youtu.be/W8onPaD-HVM">9/10/25</a>]</li>

<p><strong>Margaret Ackiss, A Member Of The NCGOP’s 11<sup>th</sup> Congressional District Executive Committee, Claimed That Whatley Never Stepped Up.&nbsp;</strong>According to Smokey Mountain News, “‘It’s kind of funny to say ‘step down,’ because I never saw him step up,’ said Margaret Ackiss, a member of the North Carolina Republican Party’s 11th Congressional District executive committee.” [Smokey Mountain News, <a href="https://smokymountainnews.com/news/item/40370-step-up-or-step-down-whatley-blames-democrats-after-calls-to-resign-grow-louder">10/22/25</a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Ackiss Claimed That Helene Recovery Should Be Non-Partisan And That It Was Disappointing That Whatley Would Not Step Up.&nbsp;</strong>According to Smokey Mountain News, “Ackiss, a lifelong Republican who only recently saw the letter but would have signed it had she known about it, said that Helene recovery should be a non-partisan issue and that Whatley’s attempt to blame Democrats isn’t reflective of Appalachian values. ‘This is a human issue. I have friends on both sides of the aisle, although I’m a Republican. When catastrophes happen, I don’t care what party you’re in — we help the people on the ground,’ said Ackiss, who claims 10 generations of roots in the region. ‘To me, it was completely disappointing to see Michael Whatley and many others who espouse themselves to be Republicans not step up and help the people involved in this.’” [Smokey Mountain News, <a href="https://smokymountainnews.com/news/item/40370-step-up-or-step-down-whatley-blames-democrats-after-calls-to-resign-grow-louder">10/22/25</a>]</li>

<p><strong>Conrad Wrobel Claimed That Whatley’s Job Performance Was A Zero On A Scale Of Ten And That Whatley Has “Done An Extremely Poor Job.”&nbsp;</strong>According to Smokey Mountain News, “Conrad Wrobel and his Laurel Park neighbors are some of the people involved in digging out from one of the storm’s most destructive slides — a Henderson County hillside that dissolved into a torrent of mud, debris and shattered lumber that left one retired couple facing an $800,000 total loss and homeowners worried about declining property values. A year after the slide, Wrobel said neither his subdivision nor his town has seen a single dollar in federal reimbursement for the slide. ‘If it were on a scale of 10, it’d be a zero,’ he said of Whatley’s job performance, ‘because we’ve not had any interaction with him. The funding has not come down in any way. Municipalities are suffering, trying to get just some basic things done. They have to take loans to try and get funding for repairs and whatever design or engineering is required for remediation. I’d say he’s done an extremely poor job.” [Smokey Mountain News, <a href="https://smokymountainnews.com/news/item/40370-step-up-or-step-down-whatley-blames-democrats-after-calls-to-resign-grow-louder">10/22/25</a>]</p>
