# How To Win Against Michael Whatley 

DC insider and special interest lobbyist Michael Whatley would not be the champion that North Carolina needs. Whatley supported kicking thousands of North Carolinians off their health insurance, making it harder for North Carolinians to afford groceries, cutting clean energy credits that supported North Carolina’s growing clean energy sector, and defended tariffs that were crushing the North Carolina economy. While defending harmful policy decisions, Whatley failed Western North Carolinians as the hurricane recovery czar. Whatley cares more for his swampy DC friends and special interest buddies than North Carolina families. 

### Whatley Supported Devastating Health Care Cuts 

-   Whatley [supported](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rnc-chair-says-big-beautiful-bill-key-part-gops-strategy-win-seats-midterm-elections) the “One Big Beautiful Bill” which was estimated to kick over [650,000 North Carolinians](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/04/rural-americans-medicaid-cuts-trump-bill) off of their health coverage. The legislation was described as [killing](https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2025/06/27/bill-could-unravel-expansion/) North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion which expanded healthcare to hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians. On top of ripping healthcare away from North Carolinians, the legislation was also placing [rural hospitals at risk](https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/nc-rural-hospitals-risk-closure-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-june-2025/).
-   Despite [warnings](https://www.wunc.org/politics/2025-06-30/senate-megabill-nc-medicaid-expansion-tillis) from outgoing Senator Tillis that the legislation was bad for North Carolina, Whatley did all he could to support it, including calling [State](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article312145330.html) Senate Leader Phil Berger to urge him to embrace the bill and touting that he would have [voted](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/michael-whatley-on-breitbart-942025/s-zKHgJPOggAC?si=f8ad9d0bc6f24fcea6f5798a6c27fea9&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) for it if he were in the Senate.

**Message:** Whatley supported ripping healthcare away from thousands of North Carolinians to fund tax cuts for the wealthy.

### Whatley Supported Taking Away Food Assistance From North Carolinians 

Whatley [supported](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rnc-chair-says-big-beautiful-bill-key-part-gops-strategy-win-seats-midterm-elections) the “One Big Beautiful Bill” which made the [largest cut](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-senate-republican-leaderships-reconciliation-bill-takes) to SNAP in history. Whatley praised the legislation as a “[huge win](https://gop.com/press-release/rnc-statement-on-final-house-passage-of-president-trumps-one-big-beautiful-bill/).” More than [1,415,600](https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/snap_factsheet_north_carolina.pdf) North Carolinians rely on SNAP to afford groceries. 

**Message:** Whatley claimed that taking away food assistance from North Carolinians was a “huge win.” 

### Whatley Opposed Expanding Healthcare for North Carolinians 

-   Whatley opposed North Carolina’s 2019 Medicaid expansion claiming that it was “[socialized healthcare](https://x.com/ChairmanWhatley/status/1164745493261324290).” North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion provided healthcare to [650,000](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2025/04/09/nc-medicaid-expansion-reaches-650000-north-carolinians-enrolled-fewer-18-months-after-launch) North Carolinians with [1 in 3](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2025/04/09/nc-medicaid-expansion-reaches-650000-north-carolinians-enrolled-fewer-18-months-after-launch) Enrollees from North Carolina’s rural communities.
-   Whatley opposed the Affordable Care Act and claimed that it [didn’t work](https://youtu.be/-ee1K4YM87o?si=DeOTu3DlOx4QEbVq). Whatley claimed that there needed to be [“market-driven solutions on healthcare.”](https://americanjournalnews.com/whatley-calls-for-replacing-obamacare-with-market-driven-solutions/) As of 2016, a repeal of the Affordable Care Act would’ve resulted in more than [1 million North Carolinians](https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/12-7-16health-factsheets-nc.pdf) losing their health coverage.

**Message:** Whatley opposed pathways to expanding healthcare access for North Carolinians. 

### Whatley Supported Tariffs That Placed North Carolina’s Economy At Risk 

-   Despite the negative impact on North Carolina, Whatley [defended](https://youtu.be/T8IWIARA9i4?si=l_Ojh4vIyOU0O5WA) Trump’s tariffs and claimed that [Trump’s trade strategy was working](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/michael-whatley-the-rich-zeoli-show-492025/s-54MI7WyjEvs?si=99d636adad58456db9d9efe9f55566b3&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing). Tariffs were contributing to higher food prices, were hurting [North Carolina](https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-raleigh-a2c31f80-1557-11f0-b293-ff827b3ab337) [businesses](https://www.wxii12.com/article/tariffs-impact-north-carolina-triad-businesses/64423563) and [farmers](https://www.carolinajournal.com/how-will-tariffs-impact-nc-farmers/).

**Message:** Whatley was supporting tariffs that were hurting North Carolina businesses and residents.

### Whatley Failed As Hurricane Recovery Czar 

-   Whatley was [tapped](https://smokymountainnews.com/news/item/40093-helene-victims-still-waiting-for-whatley) by Trump to led hurricane recovery in North Carolina. However, Whatley was reported as being [absent](https://smokymountainnews.com/news/item/40093-helene-victims-still-waiting-for-whatley) during the recovery process and criticized for failing to [step up](https://smokymountainnews.com/news/item/40370-step-up-or-step-down-whatley-blames-democrats-after-calls-to-resign-grow-louder). Whatley’s failure to help residents of western North Carolina led to a [petition](https://smokymountainnews.com/news/item/40370-step-up-or-step-down-whatley-blames-democrats-after-calls-to-resign-grow-louder) calling for Whatley to be removed from his position.
-   Despite Whatley’s claims that the Trump administration wouldn’t abandon Western North Carolina, federal funding has been [bottlenecked](https://wlos.com/news/local/black-mountain-swannanoa-western-north-carolina-residents-michael-whatley-not-helping-hurricane-helene-recovery-czar-president-donald-trump-homeland-security-secretary-kristi-noem-congress-gop) and FEMA staff were [cut.](https://www.notus.org/2026-election/michael-whatley-roy-cooper-recovery-czar-title-senate-bid) When asked about Secretary Noem’s decision to [fast-track disaster aid](https://www.propublica.org/article/kristi-noem-fema-florida-naples-sinan-gursoy) for donors in Florida over Western North Carolina, [Whatley dodged the question](https://youtube.com/shorts/JMxXew6mlEo?si=opOryFDvgPC15_qY).

**Message:** Whatley’s tenure as hurricane recovery czar was failure and residents of Western North Carolina have not received the help and attention they deserved.

### Whatley Supported Cuts To Clean Energy Jobs 

-   Whatley, a long time [oil lobbyist](https://apnews.com/article/republican-national-committee-whatley-trump-mcdaniel-b0c1714ac648bfa91b6ee72a30278266), supported the “One Big Beautiful Bill” which slashed clean energy credit. Whatley praised the legislation as a “[huge win](https://gop.com/press-release/rnc-statement-on-final-house-passage-of-president-trumps-one-big-beautiful-bill/).” The end of clean energy credits threatened to [spike](https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/politics/national-politics/how-the-big-beautiful-bill-will-impact-north-south-carolina/275-8f791bb7-99f4-4ef6-8408-4d507dbb509f) North Carolinian’s energy bills and threatened [thousands](https://ncvoices.com/north-carolinas-clean-energy-gains-at-risk-as-federal-incentives-fade/) of clean energy jobs in North Carolina.

**Message:** Whatley supported harming North Carolina’s growing clean energy sector and raising North Carolinian’s energy bills in favor of the oil and gas industry that he previously lobbied for. 

### Whatley Was A DC Insider And Lobbyist

Whatley led an [special interest funded organization](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/bp-shell-climate_n_5f6e3120c5b64deddeed6762) that launched several [astroturfing campaigns](https://www.salon.com/2011/12/15/big_oil_and_canada_thwarted_u_s_carbon_standards/) and used [deceitful](https://apnews.com/article/republican-national-committee-whatley-trump-mcdaniel-b0c1714ac648bfa91b6ee72a30278266) [tactics](https://captimes.com/news/local/writers/mike_ivey/did-houston-energy-group-dupe-mge-customers-to-back-rate-changes/article_fbe07fa3-c487-5eff-84a7-72d502c842cd.html) to trick people into supporting the organization’s pro-big money causes.
-   Despite running for Senate in North Carolina, Whatley’s LinkedIn still listed [D.C](https://www.wilsontimes.com/columns/michael-whatleys-pseudo-populist-campaign-cdb1621c/). as his location of employment and held his [Senate kickoff](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/rnc-chairman-michael-whatley-to-hold-senate-campaign-kickoff-in-d-c-september-12/) in Washington D.C.

**Message:** Whatley was a DC insider and big oil lobbyist that spent his career delivering for special interests and DC politicians instead of North Carolinians.
