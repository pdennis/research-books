## Overview

In 2020, Mackenzie [claimed](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13530821/gop-candidate-state-representative-ryan-mackenzie-lied-tinder-profile.html) to be 29 years-old in his Tinder profile when he was really 37 years-old. 

When this gained national attention in 2024, 100 of Mackenzie’s female constituents [wrote to him](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13564767/100-women-ryan-mackenzie-exposed-lying-age-tinder.html) demanding he apologize. Mackenzie did not apologize and instead [accused](https://www.newsnationnow.com/on-balance-with-leland-vittert/pennsylvania-ryan-mackenzie-tinder/) the women of being “Democrat operatives” even though a majority of the women who signed the letter were [employed outside of politics](https://keystonenewsroom.com/2024/08/27/ryan-mackenzie-tinder-questions/).

**March 2020: Mackenzie Reportedly Claimed To Be 29 Years-Old In His Tinder Profile When He Was Actually 37.** According to the Daily Mail, “Eight years into his state lawmaker career, Pennsylvania state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie misrepresented his age on a dating profile by nearly a decade, Dailymail.com can reveal. In March 2020, Mackenzie, a Republican, was messaging woman from a Tinder profile claiming to be 29 years old. He was actually 37.” \[Daily Mail, [6/17/24](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13530821/gop-candidate-state-representative-ryan-mackenzie-lied-tinder-profile.html)\]

### **2024: In Response to More than 100 Female Constituents Demanding He Apologize for Lying About His Age on Tinder, Mackenzie Referred to Them as “democrat Operatives”** 

**More Than 100 Female Constituents Wrote To State Rep. Ryan Mackenzie To Demand He Apologize For Reportedly Lying About His Age On Tinder.** According to the Daily Mail, “On Monday over 100 female constituents wrote to state Rep.

-   **The Letter From 100 Of Mackenzie’s Female Constituents Criticized Mackenzie For Deceiving Young Women While A Member Of The Pennsylvania Legislature And Not Taking Accountability For His Actions.** According to the Keystone Newsroom, "After the story broke in June, over 100 women from the Pennsylvania 7th Congressional District signed a letter demanding an apology from Mackenzie for lying about his age. ‘Trolling on Tinder for younger women is one thing (we can’t help but notice that you fudged your age by nearly a decade), but doing so while you are actively serving on the Pennsylvania State Legislature is another. To make matters worse, you never took accountability for the lie, you just denied that you were married or engaged at the time,’ the letter read at the time." \[Keystone Newsroom, [8/27/24](https://keystonenewsroom.com/2024/08/27/ryan-mackenzie-tinder-questions/)\] 

**Mackenzie Claimed Most Of The Women Who Called For Him To Apologize For Lying About His Age On A Tinder Profile Were “Democrat Operatives.”** According to an interview Ryan Mackenzie gave with NewsNation, “ANCHOR: But I have to ask you, 100 women really? RYAN MACKENZIE: Yeah, you know it’s hard to believe but when you look at that list most of them are Democrat operatives. Real big thing that the Democrats do is they put together these lists, I mean we saw it of economists, who said they were, you know, they were in favor of Joe Biden’s economic platform. One of them turned out to be married to Janet Yellen. These letters that they sign off on are all campaign gimmicks and tricks. Again all pure distractions from the real issues and nothing a single voter has ever brought up to me.” \[NewsNation, [8/26/24](https://www.newsnationnow.com/on-balance-with-leland-vittert/pennsylvania-ryan-mackenzie-tinder/)\] (video) 00:03:31

-   **Keystone Newsroom Reported “An Overwhelming Majority Of Those Who Signed The Letter Were Professionals Who Work Outside Of Politics.”** According to Keystone Newsroom, "Mackenzie was given the opportunity to respond to the letter on NewsNation and claimed that most of the signers were ‘Democrat operatives.’ ‘When you look at that list, most of them are Democrat operatives. Real big thing that the Democrats do is they put together these lists,’ Mackenzie said. However, after looking through the list of women who signed the letter and searching for their occupations online, only a handful of co-signers were local elected officials, Democratic staffers or somehow connected to politics by volunteering for various causes. An overwhelming majority of those who signed the letter were professionals who work outside of politics." \[Keystone Newsroom, [8/27/24](https://keystonenewsroom.com/2024/08/27/ryan-mackenzie-tinder-questions/)\]
