## Mackenzie Promised He Would Protect Social Security, Then He Stood By While The Trump Administration Made Cuts That Hurt Services

### 2024: While Campaigning for Congress, Mackenzie Called to Protect Social Security

**Mackenzie In 2024: "We Must Stop The Wasteful Overspending And Protect Programs Like Medicare And Social Security."** According to an opinion article by Ryan Mackenzie in the Morning Call, "We must stop the wasteful overspending and protect programs like Medicare and Social Security. We must elect candidates who are willing to tackle these issues and I hope you will join me in this fight to get our country back on the right track." \[Opinion – Ryan Mackenzie, Morning Call, [4/3/24](https://www.mcall.com/2024/04/03/election-2024-your-view-by-ryan-mackenzie-my-experience-in-harrisburg-will-help-me-address-illegal-immigration-economy/)\]

**Mackenzie Promised To “Take On Wasteful Spending, Defend Seniors, And Protect Medicare And Social Security.”** According to a post on Ryan Mackenzie’s Twitter page, “While Washington politicians like Susan Wild are breaking Medicare and bankrupting Social Security. Ryan Mackenzie will take on wasteful spending, defend seniors, and protect Medicare and Social Security. Join the fight: https://mackenzieforcongress.com/record” \[Twitter, Ryan Mackenzie, [8/14/24](https://x.com/Ryan_Mackenzie/status/1823739723052933516)\]

### Mackenzie Promised to Protect Social Security from Changes that Would Negatively Affect Americans

**Mackenzie: “When It Comes To Social Security, I Am Not For Any Changes That Would Negatively Impact People Who Are In That Program.”** According to a tele-town hall hosted by Rep. Ryan Mackenzie: “MACKENZIE: But do just want to wrap up on this point to tell you that when it comes to Social Security, I am not for any changes that would negatively impact people who are in that program. We want to make sure that we in fact strengthen that program so that we guarantee that those benefits that so many people have earned are there for them when they move into retirement.” \[Rep. Ryan Mackenzie Tele-Town Hall, [3/20/25](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/ryan-mackenzie-on-social-security-32025/s-V9RMcXT1hr9?si=f401753a4361475db499d08d80649d5f&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)\] (audio) 

#### Mackenzie: “Let Me Be Very Clear. I Am Definitely Opposed To The Privatization Of Social Security.”

**Mackenzie: “Let Me Be Very Clear. I Am Definitely Opposed To The Privatization Of Social Security.”** According to a tele-town hall hosted by Rep. Ryan Mackenzie: “MACKENZIE: Let me be very clear. I am definitely opposed to the privatization of Social Security. Again, these are benefits that everybody who is in that program has earned. They have paid into that. And we want to make sure that they receive the full benefits that they are, that they have earned and that they are entitled to.” \[Rep. Ryan Mackenzie Tele-Town Hall, [3/20/25](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/ryan-mackenzie-i-am-definitely-opposed-to-the-privatization-of-social-security-032025/s-ThmieShRozp?si=73219aa24c224815ae25f6ee2a8d3f0a&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)\] (audio) 

### Mackenzie Defended DOGE’s Purpose While Criticizing Its Execution

**Mackenzie Claimed DOGE’s Concept Was Great, But The Execution Was “A Whole Different Story.”** According to the Morning Call, "‘When we’re talking about regulations or laws like you’re talking about, it’s what I’ve been saying about DOGE,’ Mackenzie said. ‘The concept is great, right? You support the concept of increasing the amount of zero emission vehicles. That’s a nice thing to shoot for in a goal, but then the execution or the practical application is a whole different story.  ‘How you get there, how that transition occurs, is what we have to be concerned about, because that’s where the rubber meets the road.’" \[Morning Call, [3/21/25](https://www.mcall.com/2025/03/21/ryan-mackenzie-lehigh-valley-trucking-leaders-regulations/)\]

**Mackenzie Defended DOGE And Its Mission.** According to Morning Call, "He accused Democrats of attempting to ‘demonize’ Musk’s efforts to find fraudulent and abusive federal spending via the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk had, while campaigning for Trump last year, promised to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget, but at a recent Cabinet meeting, he lowered that expected number and said the initiative would save the government $150 billion in 2026, the New York Times reported.  The DOGE website, which publicly tracks spending cuts and purported fraud discovered by the department, also has incorrectly reported many of its purported savings, including erroneously listing contracts that were never cancelled and inflating the actual size of several cancelled contracts. ‘Democrats want to demonize the person that created and popularized the electric car, that created and popularized so many other great inventions because he wants to come in and look at waste, fraud and abuse,’ Mackenzie said of Musk. ‘Again, they are fighting against change. They are fighting against cutting waste, fraud and abuse in our government. That’s what people are fighting against when they’re fighting against Elon Musk and the DOGE initiative, the Department of Government Efficiency.’" \[Morning Call, [4/11/25](https://www.mcall.com/2025/04/11/rep-ryan-mackenzie-defends-tariffs-doge-economic-outlook-at-cnn-town-hall/)\]
