<h2><strong>McCormick Peddled Antivax, Fluoride, And COVID Conspiracies&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>McCormick Promoted Unproven COVID Treatments And Faced A Misinformation Complaint Before The Georgia Medical Board</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Dr. McCormick Promoted Unproven Drugs As COVID Treatments And Was The Subject Of A Misinformation-Related Report Before The GA Medical Board.</strong> According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “The board currently has two misinformation-related reports pending. One is a second complaint filed against the candidate, Dr. Rich McCormick, and the other involves Augusta pediatrician Dr. Alan Getts [...] A Peachtree Corners resident who blogs on medical fraud filed the first complaint about McCormick in October 2020, saying the Republican candidate for the U.S. House’s 7th Congressional District had repeatedly promoted unproven drugs as COVID treatments and downplayed the severity of the virus. The statements were made in Twitter posts and during appearances on far-right media outlets known for promoting conspiracy theories about the pandemic and the 2020 election.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/coronavirus/georgias-medical-board-mum-as-doctors-spread-covid-19-misinformation/CRWP7IZFBBEBPFSAVIW7AGD7CM/"><u>10/28/21</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>June 2020: Dr. McCormick Downplayed The Severity of COVID And Declared That, “My Theory, Based On Just The Evidence That We See Firsthand, Is That We Probably Do Have A Herd Immunity.”</strong> According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “In one case, while wearing a white lab coat over hospital scrubs, McCormick told the cable channel One America News about hospital admissions plummeting and intensive care units clearing out and added, ‘My theory, based on just the evidence that we see firsthand, is that we probably do have a herd immunity.’ That was in June 2020, as President Trump was saying COVID-19 was dying out. Public health experts believed nothing of the sort, and by late June the nation was setting new records each day for infections.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/coronavirus/georgias-medical-board-mum-as-doctors-spread-covid-19-misinformation/CRWP7IZFBBEBPFSAVIW7AGD7CM/"><u>10/28/21</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dr. McCormick Doubled Down In September, 2020, And Declared That “We’ve Reached A Point Of Saturation.”</strong> According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “McCormick doubled down on the herd immunity claim in early September, as a summer surge put Georgia’s death toll above 6,000. ‘We’ve reached a point of saturation,’ he said during a Rotary Club candidates’ forum.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/coronavirus/georgias-medical-board-mum-as-doctors-spread-covid-19-misinformation/CRWP7IZFBBEBPFSAVIW7AGD7CM/"><u>10/28/21</u></a>]</li>

<h4><strong><u>Dr. McCormick Downplayed The Need For Teenagers To Vaccinate Against COVID</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>June 2021: McCormick Downplayed The Need For Newly-Eligible Teens To Vaccinate Against COVID, “If A Twelve-Year-Old Or Fifteen-Year-Old Doesn't Want To Get The Vaccination, And Their Parents Don't Want Them To Get The Vaccination – Who Really Cares?” </strong>According to 11 Alive, “Critics say a physician running for congress in Georgia has spread misinformation on masks and for some COVID vaccines. Dr. Rich McCormick is a physician who came close to winning the 7th district congressional race last year, and he's running for it again next year. [...] In late spring, McCormick also downplayed the need for newly-eligible teenagers to get vaccines, saying on June 8, ‘If a twelve-year-old or fifteen-year-old doesn't want to get the vaccination, and their parents don't want them to get the vaccination – who really cares?’” [11 Alive, <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/critics-physician-running-for-congress-in-georgia-sidesteps-science/85-d6bf03d9-9efe-4a13-be81-074023b698f8"><u>9/29/21</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pediatric COVID Cases Spiked Weeks After McCormick’s Comments. </strong>According to 11 Alive, “Weeks after his comments, pediatric cases would spike once schools started again. ‘In general, it's a problem for people to spread misinformation. It's especially problematic once someone who has a medical degree after their name propagates something with no basis in science,’ Heiman said.” [11 Alive, <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/critics-physician-running-for-congress-in-georgia-sidesteps-science/85-d6bf03d9-9efe-4a13-be81-074023b698f8"><u>9/29/21</u></a>]</li>

<h4><strong><u>Health Care Professionals Condemned Dr. McCormick’s “Misinformation” That Undermined “The Basic Public Health Principles That Have Been Proven Effective In Pandemic Response”</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>October 2020: 120 Health Care Professionals Penned A Letter Asking The Medical Association Of Georgia To Rescind Dr. McCormick’s Endorsement “Because The Misinformation He Is Promoting Is Not Only Scientifically Incorrect, It Also Undermines Policies That Are Evidence-Based And Serves To Further Polarize Our Citizens Along Ideological Lines.”</strong> According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “A letter signed by 120 health care providers this week asked the Medical Association of Georgia, the state’s most prominent advocacy arm for doctors, to rescind its endorsement of McCormick. ‘We take issue with Dr. McCormick because the misinformation he is promoting is not only scientifically incorrect, it also undermines policies that are evidence-based and serves to further polarize our citizens along ideological lines rather than reaffirming the basic public health principles that have been proven effective in pandemic response,’ the letter said.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/mccormick-bourdeaux-face-off-in-battleground-7th-congressional-district/V7OLZU2RMRCOFAM2EEFQMR3WAM/"><u>10/9/20</u></a>]</p>
<h3><strong>McCormick Entertained A Possible Link Between Fluoride And Autism</strong></h3>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Dr. McCormick Said That He Grew Up “Where They Had Great Drinking Water, No Fluoride Added” And Claimed To Not “Remember Having Any People I Knew Who Had Autism.”</strong> “I hope it'll be something definitive. Some of it's very easy to pass out. You can see that certain states historically have not had fluoride because they had the highest cavity rate as well. But I grew up in Oregon, where they had great drinking water, no fluoride added, and I don't remember having any people I knew who had autism. I don't know. That's just my own exposure.” [NewsmaxTV: Rob Schmitt, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc4mRc0o6bQ"><u>4/14/25</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Dr. McCormick Spoke As If The Fluoride-Autism Link Was Proven And Bemoaned “All The People That Have Been Affected, The Financial Impact, The Health Impact, The The Family Impacts Of This, This Can Be Traumatic.”</strong> “HOST: Utah is, I guess, recommending its removal already, right. Do you think more states will follow? MCCORMICK: I think so, especially if you find any link to something that's consequential to your health. Yeah, especially when we've seen so much varying. Think about though, this has been around since the mid-forties. Think about all the people that have been affected, the financial impact, the health impact, the the family impacts of this, this can be traumatic.” [NewsmaxTV: Rob Schmitt, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc4mRc0o6bQ"><u>4/14/25</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Dr. McCormick Hoped RFK Jr.’s Fluoride-Autism Study Had “Positive Results” And Claimed That The Issue “Goes To Show You What Government Can Do, Can Have Unintended Consequences For Everybody.”</strong> “HOST: This is, I don't know what the hell fluoride is. I'm sure it's just a chemical, but it's it's obviously not something that is, you know, naturally created. And therein lies the problem, Right? MCCORMICK: But then it's out there and we've been exposed to it in different amounts depending on where you live. It’s something we use and if you look at the the chemical tables and what it does to react, to get rid of the things that cause cavities, it also has a reaction inside of your body. But I don't want to overreact too much, but I hope it has positive results. This goes to show you what government can do, can have unintended consequences for everybody.” [NewsmaxTV: Rob Schmitt, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc4mRc0o6bQ"><u>4/14/25</u></a>]</p>
<h3><strong>McCormick Entertained MMR Vaccine Conspiracies&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Dr. McCormick Urged Americans To Vaccinate Their Children But Questioned If “We've Done A Very Good Job Of Regulating Vaccinations And Have Too Many.”</strong> “Well, first of all, I still believe in being vaccinated. I think it's something we did with our children for a long time. The MMR vaccine now, not only mumps and rubella, things that are very deadly to children. Now, I don't think that we've done a very good job of regulating vaccinations and have too many. Quite frankly, I think that's where the concerns over autism and other things can be associated with that. But I think that people should get immunizations.” [NewsNation Live, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ETl04g2Cs"><u>4/21/25</u></a>]</p>
