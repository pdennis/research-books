<h3><strong>April 2025: McCormick Revealed The Details Of His “Great Relationship” With Texas Rep. Beth Van Duyne</strong></h3>
<p><strong>McCormick Said That He And Van Duyne “Have Synergistic Efforts In Congress” And Playfully Dismissed Questions On A Looming Proposal.</strong> According to the Daily Mail, “Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., sat down with DailyMail.com to talk about Trump's first 100 days and his high-profile relationship with another member of Congress. Chatting at a media event for House Republicans on Monday, McCormick candidly shared that his relationship with Rep. Beth Van Duyne, R-Texas, is going well. ‘So we've been dating for a minute, and we have a great relationship,’ the handsome lawmaker shared with a smile. [...] Their cozy relationship has been ongoing now for about a year, but McCormick did not tip his hand to DailyMail.com when pressed if there is a proposal coming down the pipeline soon. ‘You guys are way ahead!’ he charmingly shot back. He then dove into how the pair have kindred districts that share many of the same problems. ‘I think we have synergistic efforts in Congress,’ he said. ‘We have very similar districts.’ The Georgia and Texas Republicans both represent some of the richest districts in the U.S., and they share legislative objectives, too, McCormick, 56, said. ‘I think we compete with each other on business, on opportunities. We both see government very similarly.’ Their shared values include reducing the size and scope of government, cutting regulations, taxes and empowering business. ‘Those are things we're focused on right now,’ he concluded. ‘The rest is personal,’ he said again flashing a pearly white smile.” [Daily Mail, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14657219/republican-relationship-beth-van-duyne-affair-washington-d.html"><u>4/29/25</u></a>]</p>
