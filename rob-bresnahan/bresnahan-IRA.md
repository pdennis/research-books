The drugs treat a variety of conditions including blood clots, arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, psoriasis, and Crohn’s disease. \[…\] Rob Bresnahan, Cartwright's opponent in the race for the 8th Congressional District seat of Pennsylvania, believes there are more prudent ways to lower prescription costs.  ‘There are more effective ways to reduce drug prices than Congressman Cartwright’s choice to vote for a massive government spending bill that has hampered our economy and contributed to rising costs on everything from food to gas,’ he said. ‘In northeastern PA, which Congressman Cartwright clearly has forgotten about during his 10-plus years in Washington, we call this passing the buck, and it’s making it harder for people to make ends meet.’" \[Scranton Times Tribune, [8/19/24](https://www.thetimes-tribune.com/news/business/lower-prescription-drug-prices-benefit-seniors/article_f0a2434c-5e29-11ef-bba1-b7391f827377.html)\]
