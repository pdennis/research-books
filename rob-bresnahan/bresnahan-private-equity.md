## Overview

Bresnahan told the story of [running a family business](https://seventy.org/2024-voter-guide/2024-voter-guide5/rob-bresnahan), but what he left out is that before he started running for congress he [sold the company to a private equity firm](https://caifunds.com/cai-announces-first-close-of-seventh-fund-and-first-transaction-midwestern-electrics-partnership-with-kuharchik-construction/), which are known for [cutting jobs](https://whyy.org/articles/crozer-health-delaware-county-closes/), [closing businesses](https://www.wpxi.com/news/local/charleroi-glass-plant-open-generations-close-friday/GYLZ4BKIJFHERH722NEXJGONNI/), and [leaving Pennsylvania workers stranded](https://penncapital-star.com/energy-environment/private-equity-kept-aging-homer-city-plant-open-then-closed-it-with-no-plan-for-the-community/). 

## Bresnahan Presented Himself As A Champion For Working Pennsylvanians, But Was A Multimillionaire Who Sold His Family Company To A Private Equity Firm

### Bresnahan Presented Himself As Someone Who “Understood The Hardworking People” In His District

**Bresnahan Said Becoming CFO Of His Family’s Business At 19 And Working Through The 2008 Financial Crisis Gave Him A “Great Perspective On What Entrepreneurs Across The Country Go Through.”** According to Committee of Seventy, “At the young age of 19, I became the CFO of Kuharchik Construction, my family's electrical contracting business. This was right after the housing market crash of 2008 which put serious financial strain on our company. It was not easy, but we scratched and clawed our way out of it. Since then, our company has tripled in size from 50 employees to 150 employees across Pennsylvania, providing our workers with good family-sustaining wages. In the end, it made our business stronger and it gave me a great perspective on what entrepreneurs across the country go through to achieve the American Dream. I want to make that dream attainable for every American regardless of the situation they were born into.” \[Committee of Seventy, Viewed [7/7/25](https://seventy.org/2024-voter-guide/2024-voter-guide5/rob-bresnahan)\]

**10/6/24: Bresnahan Vowed To “Protect Family-Supporting Jobs” If Elected.** Rob Bresnahan tweeted, “Harris and Cartwright are out of touch with what it takes to support working class families. I have created hundreds of good-paying, blue-collar jobs in NEPA. As your congressman I will protect family-supporting jobs for the future of #PA08 http://tinyurl.com/m4fxnn9u”

#### Bresnahan: “Everything In My Life Has Been A Battle To Obtain”

**Bresnahan On 10/9/24: “Everything In My Life Has Been A Battle To Obtain.”** According to Bloomberg, “Bresnahan, with rapid-fire energy, blames Cartwright for failing to bring economic change to the region, and said his own work reflects a dedication to improving his home, both by expanding Kuharchik and redeveloping buildings, bringing new businesses to faded downtowns. ‘I didn’t need to grow,’ into development or add ‘100 more mouths to feed,’ Bresnahan said. ‘I did it because I’m not waking up to be mediocre. And it’s about time that this district has someone that’s going to truly fight for Northeastern Pennsylvania.’ He bristles at the suggestion he was handed success, saying he purchased Kuharchik via stock redemption and took on significant financial obligations to his grandparents. ‘Everything in my life has been a battle to obtain,’ he said.” \[Bloomberg, [10/9/24](https://news.bgov.com/bloomberg-government-news/gop-seizes-on-biden-exit-to-make-play-for-working-class-scranton)\]

### 2023: Bresnahan Sold His Family’s Electrical Contracting Company To A Private Equity Firm

#### 2023: Bresnahan Sold His Family’s Company, Kuharchik, To Midwestern Electric, A Portfolio Company Of Canadian Private Equity Firm CAI Capital Partners

**7/19/23: Kuharchik Construction And Wyoming Electric & Signal, Inc. Were Sold To Midwestern Electric, A Portfolio Company Of CAI Capital Partners.** According to a press release from CAI Capital Partners, “In conjunction with the first close, Fund VII completed its first transaction. Its investment in Midwestern Electric (‘MWE’), a CAI Capital Partners VI LP portfolio company, will support MWE’s partnership with Kuharchik Construction, Inc. and Wyoming Electric & Signal, Inc. (collectively ‘Kuharchik’). Like MWE, Kuharchik is a specialized electrical infrastructure services provider that focuses on the maintenance and installation of traffic signals, streetlights, and intelligent transport systems. Based in Exeter, PA, Kuharchik services the state of Pennsylvania with a proven track record spanning decades.” \[Press Release – CAI Capital Partners, [7/19/23](https://caifunds.com/cai-announces-first-close-of-seventh-fund-and-first-transaction-midwestern-electrics-partnership-with-kuharchik-construction/)\]

-   **CAI Capital Partners Was A Private Equity Firm With “Longstanding Canadian Roots.”** According to the CAI Capital Partners website, “Having invested $1.6 billion in private equity over three decades, CAI has partnered with companies across North America. We are focused on Canada, a region where our connectivity offers a definitive edge. Our longstanding Canadian roots make us alive to the possibilities in the Canadian lower middle market and a phone call away from the experts and partners who can accelerate growth for each of our portfolio companies.” \[CAI Capital Partners Website, ‘About Us’, Accessed: [7/8/25](https://caifunds.com/#about)\]

**The Secretary-Treasurer Of The Pennsylvania AFL-CIO Criticized Bresnahan For Selling The Business To Private Equity.** According to Bloomberg, “Bresnahan became chief financial officer in his family’s company at 19, and owner after college. Democratic attack ads have labeled him a ‘rich kid’ in a hard hat who inherited opportunity and flipped it for profit after he sold Kuharchik to a Canadian private equity firm last year. ‘What we’re talking about with private equity are people who are faceless and nameless and don’t live here,’ Cartwright said, ‘and don’t give a hoot about the people who do.’ His allies pointed to other local businesses that have been depleted by private equity firms. ‘He had this great opportunity,’ but sold it to ‘the chop shops of the business world,’ said a statement from Maurice Cobb, secretary-treasurer of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO, which supports Cartwright.” \[Bloomberg, [10/9/24](https://news.bgov.com/bloomberg-government-news/gop-seizes-on-biden-exit-to-make-play-for-working-class-scranton)\]

#### Bresnahan Maintained A Meaningful Stake In Kuharchik After He Sold It To A Private Equity Firm

**Bresnahan Said The Sale Provided A “Tremendous Opportunity” For Kuharchik And Its Employees And Retained A “Meaningful Equity Stake” In The Business After It Was Sold.** According to a press release from CAI Capital Partners, “Kuharchik is led by Robert Bresnahan, Jr. who has retained a meaningful equity stake in the combined business and will continue managing operations in Pennsylvania. ‘Becoming part of the MWE and CAI team presents tremendous opportunities for our company and employees. We share a common vision for delivering exceptional electrical infrastructure solutions, and together, we have the resources to provide enhanced value to our customers in Pennsylvania and beyond,’ said Robert Bresnahan, Jr., President of Kuharchik.” \[Press Release – CAI Capital Partners, [7/19/23](https://caifunds.com/cai-announces-first-close-of-seventh-fund-and-first-transaction-midwestern-electrics-partnership-with-kuharchik-construction/)\]

#### Private Equity Firms Had A History Of Laying Off Workers And Forcing Company Closures In Pennsylvania

**2025: Crozer Health, The Largest Hospital System In Delaware County, PA, Was Shuttered By Its For-Profit Owner Prospect Medical Holdings.** According to WHYY, “Crozer Health, Delaware County’s largest hospital system, will close its doors within 30 days — creating an emergency health care desert in one of Philadelphia’s most densely populated suburbs. The death rattle of Crozer Health comes after Pennsylvania, Delaware County, Penn Medicine and the Foundation for Delaware County pumped a total of $46 million over recent months to keep it functioning amid bankruptcy proceedings and sale negotiations to transition the system to a new owner. California-based parent company Prospect Medical Holdings pulled the plug Monday, leaving patients and staff in limbo about future care and jobs.” \[WHYY, [4/21/25](https://whyy.org/articles/crozer-health-delaware-county-closes/)\]

-   **Pennsylvania Officials Blamed Prospect Medical Holdings’ Previous Owners, The Private Equity Group Leonard Green & Partners, For The Forced Closure.** According to WHYY, “Representatives from the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General were heavily involved in sale negotiations. In a statement, spokesperson Brett Hambright said the office was ‘deeply disappointed’ by the closure news. In the end, office leaders said the ‘damage inflicted’ by Prospect’s former owner, private-equity firm Leonard Green & Partners, ‘who prioritized their own wealth over the well-being of a community, was too much to overcome.’ The attorney general’s office pledged to continue working through the bankruptcy process to recoup money owed to the Commonwealth ‘to the greatest extent possible in order to hold Prospect accountable for actions that caused this closure.’” \[WHYY, [4/21/25](https://whyy.org/articles/crozer-health-delaware-county-closes/)\]
-   **Leonard Green & Partners Loaded The Hospitals It Owned With Massive Debts While Delivering Over Half A Billion Dollars In Dividends To Its Stakeholders.** According to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star, “Prospect Medical Holdings, the for-profit hospital chain that owns Crozer-Chester hospital, was majority-owned by private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners from 2010 until 2021. Under Leonard Green’s ownership, Prospect loaded its hospitals with massive debt and then used the proceeds to pay shareholders more than half a billion dollars in dividends, according to an investigation by the Rhode Island attorney general’s office. Leonard Green & Partners sold its controlling interest in the chain in 2021. Neither company responded to Stateline’s requests for comment as of press time.” \[Pennsylvania Capital-Star, [1/18/24](https://penncapital-star.com/health-care/shell-game-when-private-equity-comes-to-town-hospitals-can-see-cutbacks-closures/)\]
-   **Crozer Health’s Closure Affected Nearly 3,000 Employees.** According to WHYY, “The health system currently employs nearly 3,000 people. According to a layoff notice obtained by WHYY News, the affected employees include: ∙ 1,908 employees at Crozer-Chester Medical Center ∙ 45 employees at Crozer-Chester Medical Center’s behavioral health unit ∙ 88 employees at Crozer Health’s corporate offices ∙ 351 employees at Taylor Hospital ∙ 80 employees at Crozer offices in Chester. Another 179 employees who were still employed at Springfield Hospital in outpatient and administrative services will also be affected by the new closures.” \[WHYY, [4/21/25](https://whyy.org/articles/crozer-health-delaware-county-closes/)\]

**2025: A Pennsylvania Glass Manufacturing Plant Was Forced To Close After Being Acquired By Private Equity That Wanted To Move Its Assets To A Rival Plant In Ohio.** According to WPXI, “The Correlle Brands glass plant in Charleroi will officially close on Friday, April 10th. A last batch of glass will be made at 7 a.m., ending a 132-year business, known globally for making Pyrex. Last year, the parent company of Anchor Hocking, a previous competitor, acquired the Charleroi plant. In September, it announced plans to move all glassmaking from Charleroi to its plant in Lancaster, Ohio.” \[WPXI, [4/10/25](https://www.wpxi.com/news/local/charleroi-glass-plant-open-generations-close-friday/GYLZ4BKIJFHERH722NEXJGONNI/)\]

-   **The More Than 300 Employees At The Plant Were Left In The Dark Throughout The Closing Process, Including Being Laid Off And Then Brought Back.** According to WPXI, “Employees at the Anchor Hocking glass factory say this week has been a roller coaster of emotions. People who were just laid off, just found out that they’re still needed and are being asked to come back. ‘Up and down up and down. It’s like they’re playing games with us,’ said Daniele Byrne. For 35 years, Daniele Byrne has worked at the Anchor Hocking glass factory in Charleroi. The plant, which also goes by the Corelle and Pyrex plant has been a Washington County staple for 132 years. 350 employees got word in September 2024, that the the Ohio-based glass manufacturer would shut down. The closure date kept getting pushed back - until this week - when tiered layoffs started. Byrne added, ‘I had just got done saying goodbye to two good friends and we were both crying.’ Byrne says things seemed pretty final - until 2:30 Thursday afternoon. ‘Two crews finished up. We had given their papers to them because I was with HR when they were passing them out. And then hurried up and got on the phone and called everyone to the cafeteria and told them that they need to run 3 more months,’ Byrne explained.” \[WPXI, [2/13/25](https://www.wpxi.com/news/local/charleroi-glass-plant-employees-asked-stay-3-more-months/EIV3NF524REVFBFD23NMSTOGDA/)\]

**2023: A Pennsylvania Coal Plant Was Suddenly Shut Down Six Years After Being Acquired By A Private Equity Firm.** According to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star, “When the owners of the Homer City Generating Station announced that it would finally be shuttering by July of 2023 due to competition from cheap natural gas and the costs of adhering to environmental regulations, it signaled a long-anticipated shift in Pennsylvania’s energy mix. The coal-fired power plant was the last in the state — and the largest — to make decommissioning plans, so the announcement gave some in the fossil-fuel heavy Keystone State a sense of relief, both in terms of environmental impact and health effects. \[…\] Homer City was acquired by private equity in 2017 after its previous owner filed for bankruptcy, aiming to erase $600 million in debt from its balance sheet. It was owned by General Electric, and by the utility Edison International, before that. The new owners formed a limited liability company (LLC), Homer City Generation LLC, a way of protecting themselves from responsibility for the company’s debts.” \[Pennsylvania Capital-Star, [2/18/24](https://penncapital-star.com/energy-environment/private-equity-kept-aging-homer-city-plant-open-then-closed-it-with-no-plan-for-the-community/)\]

-   **The Plant Owners Gave Employees Only 90 Days’ Notice Of Closure.** According to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star, “But many across the political spectrum feared what would happen next to the small community of Homer City, in southwestern Pennsylvania, home to just over 1,500 people. Years of instability meant its shuttering could have been better prepared for. The plant owners gave just 90 days’ notice of its closure as more than 120 workers prepared to pack their bags to face an uncertain future. ‘Instead of recognizing the market shift and preparing for the transition to clean, renewable generation,’ Leigh Martinez, communications director at nonprofit advocacy group PennFuture, wrote in a statement, ‘fossil fuel-friendly legislators have spent years in denial.’ Homer City residents and former plant employees say the community has been left in dire straits as a result.” \[Pennsylvania Capital-Star, [2/18/24](https://penncapital-star.com/energy-environment/private-equity-kept-aging-homer-city-plant-open-then-closed-it-with-no-plan-for-the-community/)\]
-   **The Plant’s Private Equity Owners Fired Employees And Cut Back On Maintenance In Order To “Be A Far More Profitable Member Of The Community.”** According to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star, “That denial campaign was waged in part by the plant’s private equity owners, who slashed headcount and cut back on maintenance to keep the plant alive and squeeze whatever profit they could out of the aging facility. After the plant was acquired by private equity in 2017, Homer City Generation President and CEO William Wexler cut right to the chase about his intentions: ‘I’ve spoken to all the employees, and I explained who we are and what we’re here to do… to get this plant to be a far more profitable member of the community and to sell it.’ ‘Changes in ownership, operators, and gaps in maintenance have led to operational issues and instability’ at the plant, energy firm NRG, which once managed the plant, wrote in a one-pager, which has since been taken down.” \[Pennsylvania Capital-Star, [2/18/24](https://penncapital-star.com/energy-environment/private-equity-kept-aging-homer-city-plant-open-then-closed-it-with-no-plan-for-the-community/)\]
