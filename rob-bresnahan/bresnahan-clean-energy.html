<h2>Bresnahan Claimed To Support Inflation Reduction Act Clean Energy Tax Credits, Then Voted To Cut Them</h2>
<h3>February 2025: Bresnahan Voted In Favor Of THe Republican Budget Proposal, Which Made Sweeping Cuts To The Inflation Reduction Act Clean Energy Tax Credits</h3>
<p><strong>2/25/25: Bresnahan Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Framework That Included $2 Trillion In Cuts, Raised The Statutory Debt Limit By $4 Trillion, And Required House Committees To Recommend Legislation That Would Implement Trump’s Agenda.</strong> In February 2025, Bresnahan voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the concurrent resolution that would recommend a budget for fiscal 2025 and budget levels through fiscal 2034. The resolution would assume minimum savings of $1.5 trillion over 10 years and 2.6 percent economic growth over the same period. It also would require the statutory debt limit to be raised by $4 trillion. It also would authorize the House Ways and Means Committee to increase deficits by $4.5 trillion over 10 years to extend the 2017 tax cuts and implement new tax cuts proposed by the White House. It also would provide instructions for the budget reconciliation process through which separate legislation could be considered and passed in the Senate via a simple majority vote. The measure would deliver instructions to 11 House committees to report legislation that would implement President Donald Trump’s agenda, such as expanding tax cuts and bolstering border security and immigration enforcement. The committees would be required to report their legislative recommendations to the House Budget Committee by March 27, 2025. It also would set a $2 trillion target for the spending cuts to be submitted to the House Budget Committee. The resolution also would stipulate that if the committees don't reach that target, the Ways and Means’ reconciliation instructions to increase the deficit by a maximum of $4.5 trillion would be decreased by the amount the other committees come in below the target. Similarly, it would stipulate that Ways and Means could increase the deficit above the $4.5 trillion level by the amount of savings the committees achieve above the $2 trillion target.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 217 to 215.

  <li><strong>The Republican Budget Proposal Threatened Massive Cuts To Clean Energy Initiatives.</strong> According to a press release from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, “While the bill text has yet to be drafted, the framework approved by the House Budget Committee would provide an additional $4 trillion in spending, including the tax cut extensions and additional funding for the military and border. The bill would also pursue&nbsp;at least&nbsp;$2 trillion in cuts to funding for social and domestic programs, including rescinding clean energy initiatives, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP; previously known as food stamps), and Medicaid. The Senate Budget Committee is pursuing their own ‘skinny’ budget reconciliation package that would carry an additional $342 billion in funding for the military and border and will likely seek at least $4 billion in spending cuts, including rolling back some of the clean energy initiatives created under the “Inflation Reduction Act” and potential cuts to SNAP and Medicaid.” [Press Release – National Low Income Housing Coalition, <a href="https://nlihc.org/resource/house-budget-committee-approves-framework-massive-bill-to-slash-social-programs">2/18/25</a>]</li>

<h3>March 2025: Bresnahan Joined 21 House Republicans in Urging Republican Leaders to Protect Clean Energy Tax Credits Created by The Inflation Reduction Act</h3>
<p><strong>Bresnahan Joined 21 House Republicans In Signing A Letter Urging Leadership To Preserve The IRA’s Clean Energy Tax Credits.</strong> According to the Daily Caller, "Twenty-one House Republicans, led by New York Republican Rep. Andrew Garbarino, wrote a joint letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith Sunday, urging Congress’ chief tax writer to preserve hundreds of billions of dollars in green energy tax credits from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that he signed into law in August 2022. […] Four freshmen lawmakers, Republican Reps. Ryan Mackenzie and Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania and Gabe Evans and Jeff Hurd of Colorado also signed the letter."

  <li><strong>Bresnahan: “I Actually Signed On To A Letter To Support The Energy Tax Credits With Inside Of The Inflation Reduction Act, Because I Think There's A Time And Place For All Sources Of Energy As We Continue To Move Forward.”</strong> According to a tele-town hall hosted by Rep. Rob Bresnahan, “BRESNAHAN: But Administrator Zeldin is fully aware of the capabilities of what Wayne County could bring to the table. And referencing back the AI data center opportunities, these are going to require energy. And I think we can tie this all back in to the demand that we're going to have for the energy. But I also think we can talk about renewables and there is a plethora of opportunities. I actually signed on to a letter to support the energy tax credits with inside of the Inflation Reduction Act, because I think there's a time and place for all sources of energy as we continue to move forward.” [Rep. Rob Bresnahan Tele-Town Hall,&nbsp;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/e53d9af5-15bc-4d91-a499-5d66ed4526aa/s-B6PQa6lzzZj?si=8b245ff552644161ba5509106c984670&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">3/25/25</a>] (audio)</li>

<p><strong>Bresnahan Said The Inflation Reduction Act’s Clean Energy Tax Credits Provided Development For Trades And The PA-08 Workforce.</strong>&nbsp;According to the Washington Examiner, "House GOP leadership is in for a rollercoaster to get President Donald Trump’s ‘one big beautiful bill’ passed with one of the smallest majorities in history as a Texas GOP firebrand calls for a full repeal of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. […]&nbsp; ‘I think my letter spells out, that a good coalition of members signed on to, there’s been an existing level of development ongoing in my district specifically,’ Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-PA) told the Washington Examiner. ‘I can’t speak to Mr. Roy’s district, but for us and our district and our building trades and our workforce, there’s significant development going on that these tax credits will be very beneficial to.’" [Washington Examiner,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/3363059/chip-roy-demand-biden-ira-law-repeal-trump-agenda/">3/30/25</a>]</p>
<h3>May 2025: Bresnahan Signed A Letter Urging House Republicans To Change The Phase-Out Plan For IRA Clean Energy Tax Credits</h3>
<p><strong>May 2025: Bresnahan Signed A Letter Urging The U.S. House Ways And Means Committee To Change The Phase-Out Plan For Clean Energy Tax Credits.</strong> According to Politico E&amp;E News, "Twelve House Republicans are urging congressional leaders to consider ‘three thoughtful changes’ to legislation that would repeal or scale back a host of tax incentives from the Democrats’ 2022 climate law. […] Led by Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.), the Republicans said the tax bill included some ‘reasonable phase-out schedules’ but that changes would ensure ‘certainty for current and future energy investments to meet the nation’s growing power demand and protect our constituents from higher energy costs.’ Specifically, their three suggestions include revising a foreign entity of concern provision to give companies more time to reorganize their supply chains, tweaking standards for when companies qualify for credits and keeping the practice of ‘transferability’ through 2031, when certain incentives would sunset. Transferability allows project sponsors to transfer credits to a third party to reduce their tax burden. […] Other Republicans who signed the new statement included Andrew Garbarino of New York, Mark Amodei of Nevada, Don Bacon of Nebraska, Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, Gabe Evans of Colorado, Dave Joyce of Ohio, Young Kim of California, Mike Lawler of New York, Dan Newhouse of Washington and David Valadao of California."

<h3>May 2025: Bresnahan then Voted For The House Republican Budget Bill That Repealed Clean Energy Tax Credits Created By The Inflation Reduction Act</h3>
<p><strong>5/22/25: Bresnahan Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Included $3.8 Trillion In Tax Cuts Offset By $1.5 Trillion In Spending Reductions To Programs Like Medicaid And The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</strong> In May 2025, Bresnahan voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would provide for approximately $3.8 trillion in net tax cuts and $321 billion in military, border enforcement and judiciary spending, offset by $1.5 trillion in spending reductions, as instructed in the fiscal 2025 budget resolution. It would raise the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion and provide for increased spending on defense and border security, spending cuts on social safety net programs, such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It also includes a mix of tax breaks for businesses and individuals; tax increases on universities and foundations; and a phase-down of clean energy tax credits. […] It would reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by requiring states to shoulder more of the cost, expand work requirements for SNAP, extend programs authorized under the 2018 farm bill, and prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Program. As amended, it would cap state and local tax deductions at $40,000 for households with incomes below $500,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 215 to 214.

  <li><strong>The House Republican Budget Bill Included Cuts To Federal Tax Credits For Wind, Solar, Storage, And Other Clean Energy Projects.</strong> According to Utility Dive, "House Republicans on Thursday morning narrowly passed a sweeping budget bill that guts federal support for wind, solar, storage and other clean energy industries. The bill terminates most technology-neutral clean energy tax credits for projects placed in service after 2028 and those that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill’s passage. It also tightens restrictions on foreign entities’ involvement in projects, creating a ‘truly untenable’ situation for developers, Jefferies analysts said Thursday. Nuclear projects have more time to qualify for the credit."

<p><strong>June 2025: Bresnahan Signed Letter Urging Senate Republicans To Scale Back Cuts To Clean Energy Tax Credits In The House GOP Budget Bill, Which She Voted For.</strong>&nbsp;According to NBC News, "Thirteen House Republicans who supported President Donald Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ sent a letter Friday urging Senate GOP leaders to scale back some of its clean energy cuts, sparking pushback from conservative hard-liners. The unusual criticism of their own bill indicates a modicum of regret by the GOP lawmakers, whose votes were critical to the bill passing the House by a narrow margin last month. ‘While we were proud to have worked to ensure that the bill did not include a full repeal of the clean energy tax credits, we remain deeply concerned by several provisions,’ said the Republicans in the letter, led by Rep.

<p><strong>Bresnahan Claimed House Republicans’ Budget Bill Was Not Perfect And He Would Have Liked The Sunsetting Of The Inflation Reduction Act Clean Energy Tax Credits To Have Been Delayed Or Extended Over More Time.</strong>&nbsp;According to a tele-town hall hosted by Rep. Rob Bresnahan: “BRESNAHAN: Would I have, everything inside of the reconciliation bill perfect? Hardly. Would I have liked to have seen some of the sunsetting of the energy tax credits be delayed or extended over a more gradual piece of, over a gradual period of time. But I feel that it needs to be a holistic approach from generating our next workforce and also having the availability of affordable energy so we can do manufacturing and we can create things. And there is no reason why Northeastern Pennsylvania can’t be the epicenter to that.” [Rep.

<h3>July 2025: Bresnahan Voted for The Final Republican Budget Bill that Repealed Clean Energy Tax Credits Created by The Inflation Reduction Act</h3>
<p><strong>7/3/25: Bresnahan Voted For The Senate FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Extended $4 Trillion In Expiring Tax Cuts, Added New Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025, Bresnahan voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, the “motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214.

  <li><strong>The Final Republican Budget Bill Made Significant Cuts To Renewable Energy Tax Credits And Programs.</strong>&nbsp;According to KSJD, “On Thursday July 3, the House of Representatives passed the budget bill, known as the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' which included sweeping cuts to renewable energy tax credits and programs. The bill claws back funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration's landmark climate legislation, and changes or cuts energy and manufacturing tax credits. For example, solar and wind energy that are built and come online after 2027 will no longer be eligible for tax credits, significantly reducing the timeline for any projects to get off the ground.” [KSJD, <a href="https://www.ksjd.org/2025-07-07/house-budget-bill-slashes-renewable-energy-credits-sparking-backlash">7/7/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Final Version Of The GOP Budget Bill Phased Out Tax Credits For Wind And Solar Power, Derailing Current And Planned Projects In Those Industries.</strong>&nbsp;According to the New York Times, “The bill would quickly phase out tax credits for wind and solar power,&nbsp;two of the fastest growing sources of electricity&nbsp;in the United States. Both industries could shrink but are unlikely to vanish, experts said. Previously, companies building wind and solar farms could qualify for a tax credit worth at least 30 percent of costs if they began construction before 2034. Under the new law, projects would likely need to start construction&nbsp;within the next year&nbsp;— roughly by July 2026 — to have the best chance of getting the full credit. After that, the subsidy becomes harder to get and swiftly expires.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/climate/congress-bill-energy.html">7/3/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Federal Incentives For Electric Vehicles Were Repealed In The Final Version Of The GOP Budget Bill.</strong>&nbsp;According to the New York Times, “The bill&nbsp;is likely to put a major dent&nbsp;in the U.S. electric car market by repealing federal incentives that have been critical to its growth. Tax credits worth up to $7,500 to buy new or used electric cars will end by Sept. 30, 2025 under the new bill. (Those credits were previously available until 2032.) Also expiring is a loophole that allowed companies to pass tax savings on to people who leased vehicles. Incentives for businesses to buy electric trucks will vanish. Electric cars won’t disappear from dealerships, but they will get pricier. At the same time, the Trump administration is rolling back federal fuel-efficiency rules and&nbsp;has sought to block a California plan&nbsp;intended to force automakers to sell more zero-emissions vehicles.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/climate/congress-bill-energy.html">7/3/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>At The Same Time, The Final Version Of The GOP Budget Bill Granted Oil And Gas Companies Reduced Royalty Rates For Mining On Federal Land, A Tax Break To Oil And Gas Producers And A Tax Break On The U.S. Production Of Metallurgical Coal.</strong> According to the New York Times, “The legislation mandates oil and gas lease sales in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico and the American West. It lowers the royalty rates that coal companies pay to mine on federal lands. It provides additional tax breaks to oil and gas producers for ‘intangible drilling and development costs.’ And it delays for 10 years a hefty fee on oil and gas companies that leak methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from their operations. In a surprising last-minute change, Senate Republicans added a 2.5 percent tax break for U.S. production of&nbsp;metallurgical coal, a form of coal that has been used for decades in steel-making and is mainly exported to countries like India and Brazil.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/climate/congress-bill-energy.html">7/3/25</a>]</li>

<h4>The Republican Budget Bill Was Projected To Increase Energy Costs For Households And Businesses By $28 Billion Per Year In 2030</h4>
<p><strong>Initial Reports On The Impact Of The GOP Budget Bill Estimated It Would Raise U.S. Household And Business Energy Costs By $28 Billion Annually In 2030.</strong>&nbsp;According to Utility Dive, “The REPEAT Project, an initiative from Princeton University’s ZERO Lab,&nbsp;estimated in an initial report&nbsp;that&nbsp;the legislation will cut capital investment in U.S. electricity&nbsp;and clean fuels production by $500 billion over the next 10 years and raise U.S. household and business energy expenditures by $28 billion annually in 2030. The report also estimates the bill will result in a reduction in cumulative new solar capacity additions by 140 GW and wind capacity additions by 160 GW over the next 10 years.” [Utility Dive, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-passes-senate-megabill-trump-ira-tax-credit/752276/">7/3/25</a>]</p>

  <li><strong>6/11/25: While Reporting On Bresnahan’s Opposition To Biden-Era Climate Rules, WHYY Noted That Bresnahan Had Invested In 20 Fossil Fuel Companies.</strong>&nbsp;According to WHYY, "Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania are applauding two Trump administration proposals that opponents say would upend Biden-era rules that aim to reduce climate-warming emissions and toxic air pollutants from power plants, harming human health. […] Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who represents northeast Pennsylvania’s 8th District, called Biden-era rules a ‘nail in the coffin’ for the state’s energy markets. He said the construction of new natural gas plants would be ‘virtually impossible’ under current Biden environmental regulations.&nbsp; Both Meuser and Bresnahan represent areas with active natural gas production.&nbsp; Bresnahan, who has invested in more than 20 fossil fuel companies, pointed to the demand for data centers in Pennsylvania as a reason to provide more support to the power industry.&nbsp; ‘Between data centers AI and the growing domestic manufacturing base, the simple fact is we need more electrons on the grid to power all of this."
