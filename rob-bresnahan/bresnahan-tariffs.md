## Bresnahan Supported Trump’s Tariffs, Urging Businesses To “Rip The Band-Aid Off” And “Persevere”

### Bresnahan Supported Trump’s Tariffs And Said He Was “Very Excited And Anxious To See What Comes Out” of Them

**HEADLINE: "Area Congressmen Offer Support For President Trump's Trade Tariffs"** \[WVIA Radio, [4/3/25](https://www.wvia.org/news/local/2025-04-03/area-congressmen-offer-support-for-president-trumps-trade-tariffs)\]

**Bresnahan Said He Was “Very Excited And Anxious To See What Comes Out” Of Trump’s Tariff Plan.** According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, "Speaking at an event touting local breweries in Bethlehem on Wednesday, Gov. Josh Shapiro slammed Trump's tariff plan as a tax hike that would ‘harm’ consumers and small businesses. \[…\] Other Republicans on Capitol Hill offered more wait-and-see caution ahead of Trump's announcement. ‘I'm very excited and anxious to see what comes out,’ said U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who represents Lackawanna County. ‘There's just a lot of uncertainty as to what it will ultimately mean to the end user. But I don't want to get out in front of my skis until we see actually what's going to be talked about.’" \[Philadelphia Inquirer, [4/2/25](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/trump-tariffs-pa-impact-reaction-josh-shapiro-20250402.html)\]

### Bresnahan Said Industries Apprehensive Towards Tariffs Needed To “Rip The Band-Aid Off” 

**Bresnahan Claimed Industries That Were Apprehensive Towards Tariffs Needed To “Rip The Band-Aid Off” And “Persevere.”** According to the Hazleton Standard Speaker, "Bresnahan said the tariffs create apprehension. ‘I have yet to be with an industry that has said that we’re good with the tariffs,’ he said. ‘But I feel they have to rip the Band-Aid off, and you need to persevere … Targeted tariffs would be extremely beneficial, but it has to be done in the right way, and reciprocation levels are super important.’" \[Hazleton Standard Speaker, [4/4/25](https://www.standardspeaker.com/2025/04/04/congressmen-meuser-bresnahan-talk-tariffs-taxes/)\]

### Bresnahan Repeatedly Voted to Protect Trump’s Tariffs

#### September 2025: Bresnahan Voted To Protect Trump’s Tariffs

**2025: Bresnahan Effectively Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through March 2026.** In September 2025, Bresnahan voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the resolution \[that\] would allow for the tolling (the pausing of counting) of days for resolutions of inquiry from Sept. 30, 2025 through March 31, 2026. It also would provide that each day during the period from April 9, 2025, through March 31, 2026. would not constitute a calendar day for the purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution to terminate President Donald Trump's April 2, 2025 executive order declaring a national emergency regarding tariffs on imported goods. The resolution also would provide that during the period for March 11, 2025 through March 31, 2026, would not constitute a calendar day for purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution terminating a national emergency executive order declared by President Trump on Feb. 1, 2025. Such an executive order concerned tariffs on many Canadian and Mexican imports and Chinese goods. The resolution also would provide that the provisions of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act would not apply through March 31, 2026 to a joint resolution terminating the national emergency.” The vote was on the rule. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 213 to 211. \[House Vote 268, [9/16/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll268.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/16/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/268?4); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 707](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/707/all-actions);Congressional Actions, [H.Con. Res. 14](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/14/all-actions)\]

-   **Support Was Won From GOP Holdouts Through A Promise Of A Vote Later In The Week To Shorten The Block To End In January Rather Than March.** According to Politico, “GOP leaders flipped several of the Republican holdouts with a promise to add language shortening the block on tariff disapproval votes to a forthcoming measure set for approval later in the week, per two Republicans with direct knowledge of the agreement. The expiration date on the block will be reset from March 31 to the end of January, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Tuesday. It’s likely the Supreme Court will have ruled on a challenge to Trump’s tariff-declaring powers by then.” \[Politico, [9/16/25](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/16/congress/house-again-votes-to-surrender-tariff-powers-to-trump-00566975)\]

#### April 2025: Bresnahan Was The Deciding Vote To Protect Trump’s Tariffs

**2025: Bresnahan Cast The Deciding Vote For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through September 2025.** In April 2025, Bresnahan voted for, “adoption of the rule (H Res 313) that would provide for floor consideration of the Senate amendment to the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). The rule would provide up to one hour of debate on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the measure. It also would block the expedited consideration of joint resolutions terminating President Donald Trump’s tariff actions under the April 2 executive order by providing that each day during the period from April 9, 2025 through Sept. 30, 2025, will not constitute a calendar day under the federal law pertaining to terminating national emergencies.” The vote was on the rule. The underlying legislation was the FY 2025 budget resolution. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 216 to 215. \[House Vote 94, [4/9/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/9/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/94?4); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 313](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/313/all-actions);Congressional Actions, [H.Con. Res. 14](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/14/all-actions)\]

-   **Speaker Johnson Backed The Move, Claiming Trump Has “Executive Authority” And That The Tariffs Are “In The Interest Of The American People.”** According to ABC News, “House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., defended the move, telling reporters, ‘I've made it very clear I think the president has executive authority. It's an appropriate level of authority to deal with the unfair trade practices. That's part of the role of the president is to negotiate with other countries.’ Johnson said Trump told him Tuesday night that ‘there are almost 70 countries that are \[in\] some stage in negotiation of more fair-trade agreement agreements with the United States. I think that is in the interest of the American people. I think that is an ‘America First’ policy that will be effective, and so we have to give them the space to do it.’” \[ABC News, [4/9/25](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-gop-moves-prevent-votes-rescinding-trump-tariffs/story?id=120644968)\]
-   **The Vote Was The Second Use Of The Procedural Tactic To Block Votes On The Tariffs, The First Use Of It Being In March.** According to ABC News, “House Democrats, led by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., moved to force a vote on Tuesday on terminating the national emergency authority and blocking Trump's sweeping tariffs. Now, that vote is unlikely to occur. This is the second time Johnson has moved to stop the legislative calendar to prevent votes on Trump's authority on tariffs. Under House rules, these votes would typically come up within 15 calendar days but now will not if the ‘rule’ passes during the vote series Wednesday afternoon.” \[ABC News, [4/9/25](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-gop-moves-prevent-votes-rescinding-trump-tariffs/story?id=120644968)\]

#### April 2025: Bresnahan Voted To Protect Trump’s Tariffs

**2025: Bresnahan Effectively Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through September 2025.** In April 2025, Bresnahan voted for, “motion to order the previous question (thus ending debate and possibility of amendment) on the rule (H Res 313) that would providing for floor consideration of the Senate amendment to the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). The rule would provide up to one hour of debate on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the measure. It also would block the expedited consideration of joint resolutions terminating President Donald Trump’s tariff actions under the April 2 executive order by providing that each day during the period from April 9, 2025 through Sept. 30, 2025, will not constitute a calendar day under the federal law pertaining to terminating national emergencies.” The vote was on the previous question. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 217 to 212. \[House Vote 93, [4/9/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll093.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/9/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/93?4); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 313](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/313/all-actions)\]

#### March 2025: Bresnahan Missed A Vote On Whether Congress Should Reverse Trump’s Tariffs

**2025: Bresnahan Missed A Vote On A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs.** In March 2025, Bresnahan missed a vote on, “the bill that would provide for Congressional disapproval of, and nullify, a December 2024 IRS rule related to gross proceeds reporting by brokers involved in digital asset sales. The rule imposed reporting requirements, beginning in 2027, on non-custodial barkers who participate in the decentralized digital asset market. It also required brokers to file information returns and provide payee statements reporting gross proceeds from certain digital asset sales and transactions.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 292 to 132. \[House Vote 71, [3/11/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll071.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/11/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/71?4); Congressional Actions, [H.J. Res. 25](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-joint-resolution/25/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Effectively Blocked The House From Voting To Reverse Trump’s Tariffs On Mexico, Canada, And China For The Next Year.** According to the New York Times, “Republican leaders on Tuesday slipped language into a procedural measure that would prevent any resolution to end the tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China from receiving a vote this year. It passed on party lines as part of a resolution that cleared the way for a vote later Tuesday on a government spending bill needed to prevent a shutdown at the end of the week.” \[New York Times, [3/11/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]
-   **The Bill Nullified A Law That Would Allow The House And Senate To End A Disaster Declared By The President.** According to the New York Times, “In this case, Republican leaders did so using a particularly unusual contortion: They essentially declared the rest of the year one long day, nullifying a law that allows the House and Senate to jointly put an end to a disaster declared by the president.” \[New York Times, [3/11/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]
-   **The National Emergencies Act Required Consideration Of Resolutions Ending A Presidentially Declared Emergency Within Fifteen Calendar Days But Republican Leadership Included A Measure In The Bill Declaring The Rest Of The Year Did Not Constitute A Calendar Day.** According to the New York Times, “The national emergency law lays out a fast-track process for Congress to consider a resolution ending a presidential emergency, requiring committee consideration within 15 calendar days after one is introduced and a floor vote within three days after that. But the language House Republicans inserted in their measure on Tuesday declared that, ‘Each day for the remainder of the 119th Congress shall not constitute a calendar day’ for the purposes of the emergency that Mr. Trump declared on Feb. 1.” \[New York Times, [3/11/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]

### Local Businesses Warned About Rising Costs Caused By Trump’s Tariffs

**HEADLINE: "In One Analysis, Trump Tariffs On Imports Could Cost Keystone State $5.3 Billion"** \[Go Erie, [3/5/25](https://www.goerie.com/story/news/2025/03/05/trump-trade-war-tariffs-pennsylvania-analysis/81350772007/)\]

**HEADLINE: "Tariffs Impacting Construction Costs, Projects"** \[Scranton Times-Tribune, [3/30/25](https://www.thetimes-tribune.com/2025/03/30/tariffs-impacting-construction-costs-projects/)\]

**A University Of Scranton Professor Said Consumers Would See A 20 To 30-Percent Increase In Prices Due To Trump’s Tariffs.** According to WNEP, "‘To have an across-the-board tariff for imports coming to the United States from every country in the world, this is kind of unexpected,’ said Jordan Petsas, a professor of International Economics at the University of Scranton. With these new tariffs, Petsas says clothing is just one industry that will get more expensive. ‘Some of these retailers, for example, cannot absorb the whole cost of the tariffs, so they have to pass it to consumers, so we're talking maybe 20-30% increase in prices,’ said Petsas." \[WNEP, [4/3/25](https://www.wnep.com/article/news/local/lackawanna-county/impact-of-new-tariffs-on-clothing-industry-scranton-lackawanna-county/523-68b0e9c4-b454-479e-be8d-7790544f0bd8)\]

**Scranton Small Businesses Said Tariffs Brought Uncertainty And “Wish\[ed\] It Wasn’t Happening.”** According to WNEP, "‘If the prices are higher, it becomes maybe less affordable to some people, and maybe some people who might've came in to want to buy two suits might only be able to afford buying one suit,’ said Alan Smertz, the owner of Alan's Menswear. Nada Gilmartin, who co-owns Nada and Co., says she's worried about the cost of clothes she's already put orders for. \[…\]  Both clothing store owners say the tariffs bring uncertainty. ‘I wish it wasn't happening, because it's very difficult to not know if you purchase something what it's going to cost ultimately,’ said Gilmartin." \[WNEP, [4/3/25](https://www.wnep.com/article/news/local/lackawanna-county/impact-of-new-tariffs-on-clothing-industry-scranton-lackawanna-county/523-68b0e9c4-b454-479e-be8d-7790544f0bd8)\]

**Hazleton Area School District Reportedly Wanted To Buy 3,500 Computers Before Tariffs Raised Prices By Hundreds Of Thousands Of Dollars.** According to the Hazleton Standard Speaker, "Hazleton Area School District wants to buy 3,500 computers before tariffs with China take effect. Kenneth Briggs, the district’s director of technology, said he started shopping for prices for Chromebooks after President Donald Trump unveiled tariffs on China, from where the computers are imported.  He obtained a quote for $269 per computer for Chromebooks already in the United States. At that price, Hazleton Area would pay $941,500 for the shipment. Ordering them at $360 per computer, a price on devices still in China and subject to the tariff would push the district’s cost to $1,260,000 or an additional $318,500." \[Hazleton Standard Speaker, [4/14/25](https://www.standardspeaker.com/2025/04/14/hazleton-area-seeks-to-buy-3500-computers-before-tariffs-add-to-cost/)\]
