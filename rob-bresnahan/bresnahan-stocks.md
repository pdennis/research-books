## Overview

Before getting elected, Bresnahan [promised](https://www.republicanherald.com/2024/03/29/candidate-offers-policies-to-restore-trust-in-congress/) to end congressional stock trading, but after he got elected he became one of the [most prolific stock traders](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/congress-stock-trading-ban.html) in the House. It took him [months](https://www.timesleader.com/news/1695841/rep-bresnahan-introduces-legislation-to-ban-stock-trades) to introduce his own stock trading ban despite one [already existing](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/congress-stock-trading-ban.html) that he could have signed onto. When he was asked if he would just stop trading, he scoffed and suggested he would [“go broke”](https://www.wvia.org/news/local/2025-07-31/bresnahan-says-house-rules-thwart-plan-to-put-stock-other-investments-in-blind-trust) even though his net worth was [estimated](https://keystonenewsroom.com/2025/08/19/bresnahan-billionaire-donor-reveal/) to be up to $69 million. 

Bresnahan [promised](https://www.timesleader.com/news/1695841/rep-bresnahan-introduces-legislation-to-ban-stock-trades) that he would put his assets into a blind trust, then, after getting elected, claimed it was [hard](https://www.wvia.org/news/local/2025-07-31/bresnahan-says-house-rules-thwart-plan-to-put-stock-other-investments-in-blind-trust), and [wouldn’t say](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/lawmakers-congress-stock-trading-ban-3a93dc59) whether he would follow through on his promise. 

## Despite Promising To End Congressional Stock Trading, Bresnahan Became One Of The Most Active Stock Traders In Congress

### March 2024: Bresnahan Promised To Ban Congressional Stock Trading 

**March 2024: Bresnahan Promised To Ban Congressional Stock Trading.** According to the New York Times, "Last March, when Rob Bresnahan, Jr., a wealthy Republican business executive, was running to represent a competitive House district in northeastern Pennsylvania, he published a letter to the editor in a local newspaper demanding an end to stock trading by members of Congress. ‘The trust our political leaders and institutions have from Americans is at a historic low and it’s easy to understand why,’ Mr. Bresnahan wrote in the Wilkes-Barre Citizens’ Voice. ‘Too often we hear about how politicians are making millions of dollars during their time in office, and it is sickening. If we want to restore trust in government and our political leaders, then Congress needs to lead with these policies.’ If elected, Mr. Bresnahan told voters, he would co-sponsor legislation to ban stock trading by members of Congress, a practice he said ‘needs to come to an end immediately.’" \[New York Times, [4/5/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/congress-stock-trading-ban.html)\]

-   **Bresnahan: “Some Of The Most Prolific Traders In The Country Serve In Congress. Whether Or Not They Have Done Something Wrong, The Idea That We Can Buy And Sell Stocks While Voting On Legislation That Will Have A Direct Impact On These Companies Is Wrong And Needs To Come To An End Immediately.”** According to a letter to the editor Rob Bresnahan wrote in the Republican Herald, “The trust our political leaders and institutions have from Americans is at a historic low and it’s easy to understand why. Too often we hear about how politicians are making millions of dollars during their time in office and it is sickening. If we want to restore trust in government and our political leaders then Congress needs to lead with these policies. \[…\] Second, ban Congressional stock trading. Some of the most prolific traders in the country serve in Congress. Whether or not they have done something wrong, the idea that we can buy and sell stocks while voting on legislation that will have a direct impact on these companies is wrong and needs to come to an end immediately. This is the topic of bipartisan legislation right now in the House that I would happily co-sponsor. My opponent, Matt Cartwright, is not a co-sponsor of this bill.” \[Rob Bresnahan Letter to the Editor – Republican Herald, [3/29/24](https://www.republicanherald.com/2024/03/29/candidate-offers-policies-to-restore-trust-in-congress/)\]

### After Being Elected To Congress, Bresnahan became One Of The Most Prolific Stock Traders Among Freshman Members

**HEADLINE: "He Said He Would Ban Congressional Stock Trading. Now In Office, He Trades Freely."** \[New York Times, [4/5/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/congress-stock-trading-ban.html)\]

**EDITORIAL: "Be Leery Of Officials Who Promise One Thing, Do Another"** \[Editorial Board – Scranton Times-Tribune, [4/8/25](https://www.thetimes-tribune.com/2025/04/08/our-opinion-be-leery-of-officials-who-promise-one-thing-do-another/)\]

**April 2025: New York Times Reported Bresnahan Was One Of The Most Active Stock Traders Among The Freshman Congressional Members And Had Yet To Sponsor A Stock Trading Ban.** According to the New York Times, "More than two months after being sworn in, Mr. Bresnahan, who defeated a Democratic incumbent last November in one of the most expensive House races in the country, has not introduced or co-sponsored such a bill. Over that time, he has emerged as one of the most active stock traders in the freshman class, according to Capitol Trades, a site that monitors the stock market activity of lawmakers." \[New York Times, [4/5/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/congress-stock-trading-ban.html)\]

**As Of August 2025, Bresnahan Had Reported 617 Stock Trades That Totaled $7.24 Million.** According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, "U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan, a first-term Republican, has become the most active trader in Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation even as he pushes to ban the practice. Despite introducing a House bill to ban congressional stock trading in May, Bresnahan has reported 617 stock trades totaling $7.24 million this year, according to investment research firm Quiver Quantitative. He’s placed roughly five times as many trades as the next most active trader in the delegation, freshman Republican Sen. Dave McCormick, a former CEO of Bridgewater, the world’s largest hedge fund." \[Philadelphia Inquirer, [8/10/25](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/congressional-stock-trading-ban-pennsylvania-rob-bresnahan-20250810.html)\]

#### April 2025: Bresnahan’s Spokesperson Claimed Bresnahan Never Handled His Own Stock Trading And Used Financial Advisors To Trade Stocks For Him

**April 2025: Bresnahan’s Spokesperson Claimed Bresnahan Had Never Handled His Own Stock Trading And Used Financial Advisors To Trade Stocks For Him.** According to the New York Times, "Ms. Pope said that Mr. Bresnahan relies on a financial adviser to trade stocks for him, and never knows about the trades before they happen or when they occur. He also does not know the companies being traded, she said. ‘Like the overwhelming majority of Americans, Rob does not handle his own stock trading, and he never has,’ Ms. Pope said. ‘Rob’s focus is on delivering for the people of northeastern Pennsylvania by securing our border, continuing to revitalize our economy and repairing our crumbling infrastructure.’" \[New York Times, [4/5/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/congress-stock-trading-ban.html)\]

### April 2025: Bresnahan’s Spokesperson Claimed Bresnahan Had Not Yet Co-Sponsored A Bill To Ban Congressional Stock Trading Because He Wanted To Introduce His Own Bill 

**April 2025: Bresnahan’s Spokesperson Claimed Bresnahan Had Not Co-Sponsored A Bill To Ban Congressional Stock Trading Yet Because He Wanted To Introduce His Own Bill That Was Still In The Works.** According to the New York Times, "If elected, Mr. Bresnahan told voters, he would co-sponsor legislation to ban stock trading by members of Congress, a practice he said ‘needs to come to an end immediately.’ \[…\] Hannah Pope, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bresnahan said that he had yet to co-sponsor legislation on the topic because he had decided instead to introduce his own bill, which is still in the works." \[New York Times, [4/5/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/congress-stock-trading-ban.html)\]

### May 2025: Bresnahan Introduced A Stock Trading Ban And Pledged To Form A Blind Trust

**HEADLINE: "Rep. Bresnahan Introduces Legislation To Ban Stock Trades"** \[Times Leader, [5/3/25](https://www.timesleader.com/news/1695841/rep-bresnahan-introduces-legislation-to-ban-stock-trades)\]

**May 2025: Bresnahan Sponsored A Bill To Ban Members Of Congress And Their Spouses From Trading Stocks Upon Taking Office.** According to the Times Leader, "Bresnahan, R-Dallas Township, announced his introduction of the Transparency in Representation through Uniform Stock Trading Ban (TRUST) Act — legislation to ban stock trading for Members of Congress. Rep. Bresnahan said the TRUST Act would bar Members of Congress and their spouses from purchasing or selling stocks upon taking office." \[Times Leader, [5/3/25](https://www.timesleader.com/news/1695841/rep-bresnahan-introduces-legislation-to-ban-stock-trades)\]

**May 2025: Bresnahan Pledged To Form A Blind Trust.** According to the Times Leader, "To comply with his new legislation, Rep. Bresnahan said he is working with the House Committee on Ethics to move his personal holdings into a blind trust.  ‘Members of Congress should not be allowed to profit off the information they are entrusted with — this is a belief I have held since before taking office, and this belief has not changed,’ Rep. Bresnahan said. ‘I have never traded my own stocks, but I want to guarantee accountability to my constituents. That is why I am working with House Ethics to begin the process of enacting a blind trust. I want the people I represent to trust that I am in Congress to serve them, and them alone.’" \[Times Leader, [5/3/25](https://www.timesleader.com/news/1695841/rep-bresnahan-introduces-legislation-to-ban-stock-trades)\]

#### July 2025: Bresnahan Complained About The Process Of Putting His Assets In A Blind Trust

**HEADLINE: "Bresnahan Says House Rules Thwart Plan To Put Stocks, Other Investments In Blind Trust"** \[WVIA, [7/31/25](https://www.wvia.org/news/local/2025-07-31/bresnahan-says-house-rules-thwart-plan-to-put-stock-other-investments-in-blind-trust)\]

**Bresnahan Said He Felt “Pinned Between A Rock And A Hard Place” About The Handling Of His Personal Finances.** According to WVIA, “Bresnahan said he feels ‘pinned between a rock and a hard place.’ ‘I tried to put it into a qualified blind trust,’ he said. ‘And I say (to the House Ethics Committee) ‘I can't invest in foreign adversaries and, you know, fund our, biggest global competitor, China,’ and I'm not allowed to (say) that.’ Congressmen must file forms disclosing their stocks and other financial assets by May 15 each year. Bresnahan asked for and was granted a 90-day extension, which means he has until Aug. 15 to file the 2024 form. As a candidate last year, he filed a form that covers Jan. 1, 2023, through July 14, 2024. That form showed Bresnahan had assets ranging from about $18.8 million to almost $77 million and income during that period of between about $1.7 million and $8.4 million.” \[WVIA, [7/31/25](https://www.wvia.org/news/local/2025-07-31/bresnahan-says-house-rules-thwart-plan-to-put-stock-other-investments-in-blind-trust)\]

-   **Bresnahan Said He Would Continue Following The Existing Laws Around Congressional Stock Trading And Was In Constant Contact With The House Ethics Committee.** According to WVIA, “For now, he plans to continue following current federal law requiring disclosure of stock trades and providing ‘absolutely no investment advice or input to my financial advisors’ or won’t trade stocks on his own, he said. ‘There’s a lot of conversations happening in Washington (on future disclosure rules),’ he said. ‘I will continue to follow the law as written. Our compliance team and staff have been in constant communication with the House Ethics Committee about avenues to pursue and will continue to do so as these discussions happen.’” \[WVIA, [7/31/25](https://www.wvia.org/news/local/2025-07-31/bresnahan-says-house-rules-thwart-plan-to-put-stock-other-investments-in-blind-trust)\]

#### September 2025: Bresnahan’s Spokesperson Declined To Say Whether He Would Follow Through On Plans To Put His Investments In A Blind Trust

**A Spokesperson For Bresnahan’s Campaign Declined To Say Whether He Would Follow Through With Plans To Put His Investment Portfolio Into A Blind Trust.** According to the Wall Street Journal, “Now a congressman representing northeastern Pennsylvania, Bresnahan is one of the most active traders in Congress and is drawing political heat for some of the transactions, which he says are handled by an adviser who doesn’t consult him on trades. He recently suggested he wouldn’t follow through on his plan to put his investment portfolio in a blind trust as an ethical firewall. He hasn’t signed on to a leading House effort to restrict stock trading, instead introducing his own bill that ethics advocates and colleagues have said is weak. When asked during a Scranton-area radio interview if he planned to tell his adviser to stop trading stocks to avoid backlash, he replied: ‘And then do what with it? Just leave it all in accounts and just leave it there and lose money and go broke?’ Hannah Pope, a spokeswoman for Bresnahan, declined to say whether he plans to follow through with his plans for a blind trust. She said Bresnahan’s trades are executed without his input.  ‘Any suggestion that Rob has involvement in his financial planner’s trades is complete and utter bulls—,’ she said.” \[Wall Street Journal, [9/3/25](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/lawmakers-congress-stock-trading-ban-3a93dc59)\]

### July 2025: Asked About Whether He Would Just Stop Stock Trading Altogether, Bresnahan Scoffed and Suggested He Would “Go Broke”

**Bresnahan Scoffed At The Suggestion Of Telling His Financial Advisers To Stop Trading Stocks, Claiming That He Would “Go Broke.”** According to WVIA, “U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said House ethics rules have so far thwarted his try at putting his stocks and other investments into a blind trust that will block him from controlling or knowing about trades. Bresnahan, who as a candidate last year called for banning members of Congress from trading stocks, has faced sharp criticism from a Democratic political action committee for continuing to trade stocks as a congressman. He has repeatedly said he has had nothing to do with any stock trades carried out by his financial advisers since he became a congressman Jan. 3. Theoretically, Bresnahan could order his financial advisers to stop trading his stocks, but he does not plan to do that. ‘And then do what with it?’ he asked in an interview with WVIA News this week. ‘Just leave it all in the accounts and just leave it there and lose money and go broke?’” \[WVIA, [7/31/25](https://www.wvia.org/news/local/2025-07-31/bresnahan-says-house-rules-thwart-plan-to-put-stock-other-investments-in-blind-trust)\]

### Bresnahan Has Made Multiple Controversial Stock Trades Since Getting Elected to Congress

#### Bresnahan Purchased Stock In Lockheed Martin Less Than One Month Before The Israel-Iran Conflict Broke Out

**Bresnahan Made More Than 600 Stock Trades Since Coming To Office As Of June 2024, Including Purchasing Lockheed Martin Stock Less Than A Month Before The Israel-Iran Conflict Broke Out.** According to The Independent, “Bresnahan, meanwhile, continues to own a sizable stock portfolio, containing millions in assets and making more than 600 trades since coming to office this year. Less than halfway through his first full term, the congressman is now facing the same kind of suspicion from voters regarding his financial activity outside of Congress. Recent trades have included a purchase of Lockheed Martin stock reported on May 15, less than a month before Israel’s war with Iran broke out and eventually drew the U.S. into launching strikes against three targets associated with Iran’s nuclear program. Lockheed is a major defense partner of the Israeli government, and is under contract to provide the Israeli Air Force with 75 of its F-35 strike fighters.” \[Independent, [6/25/25](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/congress-iran-stock-trading-defense-b2776998.html)\]

-   **Bresnahan’s Campaign Received A $1,000 Donation From Lockheed Martin Two Weeks After He Purchased Their Stock.** According to The Independent, “Bresnahan’s re-election campaign was the recipient of a $1,000 donation from a PAC representing Lockheed Martin Corporation two weeks after reporting the trade. The donation was one of dozens the PAC made at the end of May to centrist members of both parties, an early investment in the 2026 cycle.” \[Independent, [6/25/25](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/congress-iran-stock-trading-defense-b2776998.html)\]
-   **Bresnahan Continued Claiming That All Stock Trades In His Name Were Made By A Financial Advisor Without His Involvement.** According to The Independent, “His office told The Independent on Wednesday: ‘Rep. Bresnahan does not trade his own stocks – a point he has made repeatedly. All stock trades are and have been made by a financial advisor without his involvement, and he does not know what is traded or when. He believes Members of Congress should not be allowed to profit off the information they are entrusted with, which is why he introduced legislation to ban Congressional stock trading, restoring the integrity Americans expect and deserve from their government.’” \[Independent, [6/25/25](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/congress-iran-stock-trading-defense-b2776998.html)\]

The sale came after a report identified 10 rural hospitals in Pennsylvania that faced immediate risk of closure, and a month after Mr. Bresnahan voted for the House budget resolution that paved the way for large Medicaid cuts." \[New York Times, [8/16/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/16/us/politics/bresnahan-congress-stock-trading.html)\]

From April 2, when Trump launched the sweeping tariffs, to April 8, the day before he paused many of them, more than a dozen House lawmakers and their family members made more than 700 stock trades, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of disclosure filings. Top stocks purchased in that “Liberation Week” period, by the number of trades listed in the disclosures, included MKS Instruments and JPMorgan Chase, while the most sold stocks included Honeywell International and Visa. Two lawmakers who have called for stock-trading bans in the past—Reps. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.) and Rob Bresnahan (R., Pa.)—reported the most transactions by themselves or family members, the analysis found.” \[Wall Street Journal, [6/10/25](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-tariffs-congress-stock-trades-4610ff90?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAgQKe8BYDHNdSPXRX2p13rECKXrZkF4L6PtOTMTsEpGOFDjebwHm4bigMTIz9Q%3D&gaa_ts=68950f4a&gaa_sig=Pbho-OA-7xF6u6eZqzDq3g9LOndjGXM3c_KCT0w0ytnWhJFNXU2zhcanFBofKMrzEPWv1kL6iPPijU-L9WPJ_g%3D%3D)\]

Lawmakers are required to make filings showing trading by the lawmakers as well as close family members.”
