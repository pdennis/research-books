## Overview

Bresnahan also [promised](https://x.com/Rob4PA/status/1832031067273855429) to [protect](https://broadandliberty.com/2024/07/30/rob-bresnahan-ensuring-the-future-of-social-security-and-medicare-for-northeast-pennsylvania/) Social Security. Then, he claimed the Trump administration was [taking care of America](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rVLmS_JudVA) despite acknowledging he had to [clean up](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OWTX43sO3xQ) some of the “Department of Government Efficiency’s” messes. He even [dumped](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook-remaking-government/2025/04/02/musks-day-of-reckoning-00266772) his Tesla stock at the height of DOGE’s chaos.

More than [_193,000 Pennsylvanians_](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/pa.pdf) in Bresnahan’s district relied on Social Security benefits.

## Bresnahan Defended DOGE, Which Has Forced Mass Layoffs And Reduced Services At The Social Security Administration

### Bresnahan Defended the Trump Administration, Claiming It Was “Tak\[ing\] Care of America” and “Being Fiscally Responsible”

**Bresnahan: “There's Some Things That Come Out Of You Know, Out Of Pennsylvania Avenue That Just Happen.”** According to an interview Rob Bresnahan gave on the Sue Henry Show, “BRESNAHAN: I have family members that work for Steamtown. You know, I have family members that work in the Social Security Administration. One of my best friend's wife works for the SSA. And, you know, these are dedicated people that care about their country and their jobs. And, you know, there's some things that come out of you know, out of Pennsylvania Avenue that just happen. But at the end of the day here, we try to do and clarify different situations, different challenges.” \[The Sue Henry Show, [2/26/25](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OWTX43sO3xQ)\] (audio) 

**Bresnahan: “Everything Donald Trump Said He Was Going To Do On The Campaign Trail Is Exactly What He's Doing.”** According to an interview Rob Bresnahan gave on the Chuck Volpe show, “BRESNAHAN: 77 million people voted for Donald Trump. The House of Representatives received the highest level of votes ever, and that's because people were ready for a change. People are frustrated with what was- what we were being called. And Donald Trump brought a totally different perspective. And here's what's remarkable. Everything Donald Trump said he was going to do on the campaign trail is exactly what he's doing.” \[Chuck Volpe Report, [2/17/25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak9ngbFDmAs)\] (video) 

-   **Bresnahan: “The Golden Goose Is Sick. It's Going To Stop Laying Golden Eggs. We Have To Take Care Of America. And That's Exactly What The \[Trump\] Administration Is Doing. That's Exactly What House Republicans Are Doing.”** According to an interview Rob Bresnahan gave on the Volpe Report, “BRESNAHAN: They want fiscal responsibility. They are sick and tired of being put second. We, I said on my campaign trail, the golden goose is sick. It's going to stop laying golden eggs. We have to take care of America. And that's exactly what the administration is doing. That's exactly what House Republicans are doing.” \[The Volpe Report, [3/9/25](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rVLmS_JudVA)\] (audio) 

### Bresnahan Acknowledged That he has had to step in to try to clean up the trump administration’s messes in his district

**Bresnahan Acknowledged That His Office Had Had To Step In To “Clarify Different Situations, Different Challenges” That Had Come Out Of The Trump Administration That Affected His District.** According to an interview Rob Bresnahan gave on the Sue Henry Show, “BRESNAHAN: I have family members that work for Steamtown. You know, I have family members that work in the Social Security Administration. One of my best friend's wife works for the SSA. And, you know, these are dedicated people that care about their country and their jobs. And, you know, there's some things that come out of you know, out of Pennsylvania Avenue that just happen. But at the end of the day here, we try to do and clarify different situations, different challenges.” \[The Sue Henry Show, [2/26/25](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OWTX43sO3xQ)\] (audio) 

-   **Trump Administration Fired Five National Park Service Employees At A Scranton, PA Museum That Contributed More Than $5 Million To Local Economy And Supported 84 Jobs In 2017.** According to WVIA Public Media, "The Cheseks were heartbroken to learn that five park employees were abruptly fired as part of National Park Service (NPS) cuts imposed by the Trump administration, and worry about what that could mean for Steamtown's future. \[...\] the museum was established in 1986 'to preserve, interpret and protect the history of steam railroading in America,' as its website states. Developed around a private collection that was moved from Vermont, the facility formally opened as a National Historic Site on July 1, 1995. \[...\] A 2017 National Park Service report showed that 99,600 visitors to Steamtown National Historic Site in 2016 spent $5,403,500 in communities near the park. That spending supported 86 jobs in the local area and had a cumulative benefit to the local economy of $7,432,400, the report added." \[WVIA Public Media, [2/21/25](https://www.wvia.org/news/local/2025-02-21/save-steamtown-rally-set-for-saturday-morning-in-scranton-as-supporters-blast-federal-job-cuts)\]

-   **April 2025: Tesla Announced A 13 Percent Drop In Quarterly Sales While Musk Was Set To Leave His Role As Chief Of DOGE.** According to Politico, “As the sun rose today, Musk’s company, Tesla, announced a 13 percent drop in quarterly sales — the firm’s largest plunge ever, underperforming analysts’ already-bleak estimates. Much of Musk’s vast wealth comes from Tesla, a stock market wunderkind which, in the 15 years since its initial public offering, has exploded into one of the most valuable companies in history. But its valuation has plummeted since the election, driven in no small part by Musk’s controversial role in the White House. That, too, looks like it’s coming to an end. The DOGE chief, who has jubilantly barreled through the federal bureaucracy since Trump took office, is staring down a late May or early June deadline, after which his ‘special government employee’ designation will mandate he cease his work.” \[Politico, [4/2/25](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook-remaking-government/2025/04/02/musks-day-of-reckoning-00266772)\]
-   **April 2025: Amid Low Approval Ratings On How Musk Was Handling His Work At DOGE, The White House Reported It Would Not Try To Extend Musk’s Time At The Department.** According to Politico, “Against a backdrop of Musk’s low favorability ratings, reported tiffs with Cabinet secretaries and the Wisconsin loss — which Democrats, and Musk himself, framed as a referendum on the billionaire — Trump has informed his inner circle that Musk will retreat after his status terminates, our RACHAEL BADE reports. It’s a reversal from just a month ago, when White House officials were prepared to find a way around the 130-day limit. And to rub salt in the wound, a new poll released today out of Milwaukee-based Marquette University found approval of how Musk is handling his work at DOGE stands at 41 percent, with disapproval at 58 percent, our ALI BIANCO reports. Musk’s personal favorability, the poll found, is 38 percent, with 60 percent of respondents viewing him unfavorably.” \[Politico, [4/2/25](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook-remaking-government/2025/04/02/musks-day-of-reckoning-00266772)\]

-   **Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Reported Bresnahan Owned, Bought And Sold Shares Of Private And Public Companies Rather Than Investing In Investment Funds.** According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, "While some incoming lawmakers invest only in widely held investment funds to reduce the possibility of conflicts of interest, many others — including Rep.-elect Rob Bresnahan, R-Pa., and Sen.-elect Dave McCormick, R-Pa. — own, buy and sell shares of private and public companies." \[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, [1/2/25](https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2025/01/02/president-biden-calls-for-ban-on-lawmakers-trading-on-wall-street/stories/202501010046)\]

This is the largest staffing cut in SSA’s history.\[2\] (See Figure 1.)" \[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, [6/23/25](https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/reassignment-wont-fix-the-largest-ever-social-security-staffing-cut)\]

In the field, office managers have resorted to answering phones in place of receptionists because so many employees have been pushed out. Amid all this, the agency no longer has a system to monitor customer experience because that office was eliminated as part of the cost-cutting efforts led by Elon Musk. And the phones keep ringing.

#### February 2025: Department Of Government Efficiency Falsely Claimed 150-Year Olds Were Collecting Social Security Benefits

**HEADLINE: "No, 150-Year-Olds Aren’t Collecting Social Security Benefits"** \[Wired, [2/17/25](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-social-security-150-year-old-benefits/)\]

**February 2025: Department Of Government Efficiency Claimed 150 Year-Olds Were Claiming Social Security Benefits.** According to Wired, "Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed that his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) project had uncovered massive government fraud when it alleged that 150-year-olds were claiming Social Security benefits. But Musk has provided no evidence to back up his claims, and experts quickly pointed out that this is very likely just a quirk of the decades-old coding language that underpins the government payment systems." \[Wired, [2/17/25](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-social-security-150-year-old-benefits/)\]

**The Social Security Administration Used The Old Coding Language COBOL Which Experts Said Defaulted To A May 20, 1875 Reference Date When Birth Date Data Values Were Missing, Leading To An Age Of 150 Being Shown.** According to Wired, "Computer programmers quickly claimed that the 150 figure was not evidence of fraud but rather the result of a weird quirk of the Social Security Administration’s benefits system, which was largely written in COBOL, a 60-year-old programming language that undergirds SSA’s databases as well as systems from many other US government agencies. COBOL is rarely used today, and as such, Musk’s cadre of young engineers may well be unfamiliar with it. Because COBOL does not have a date type, some implementations rely instead on a system whereby all dates are coded to a reference point. The most commonly used is May 20, 1875, as this was the date of an international standards-setting conference held in Paris, known as the Convention du Mètre. These systems default to the reference point when a birth date is missing or incomplete, meaning all of those entries in 2025 would show an age of 150." \[Wired, [2/17/25](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-social-security-150-year-old-benefits/)\]

**As Of September 2015, On A Monthly Basis, The Social Security Administration Automatically Terminated Social Security Benefits For People 115 Years-Old Or Older.** According to the Social Security Administration’s Program Operations Manual System and Wired, "Effective September 2015, the Social Security Administration (SSA) implemented an automated process in which the Regular Transcript Attainment and Selection Pass (RETAP) application selects records for which the Title II beneficiary is:  • Age 115 or older;  • In any current continuous suspense for seven years or more; and  • Entitled on a record where there are no other beneficiaries in a non-terminated status younger than the age of 115.  The Title II Redesign (T2R) system automatically selects and terminates entitlement to beneficiaries meeting the criteria in this section on a monthly basis using Ledger Account File (LAF) T9 and Reason for Suspension or Termination (RFST) of AGETRM." \[Social Secuirty Administration, Program Operations Manual System, "GN 02602.578 Termination of Entitlement for Title II Beneficiaries Who are Age 115 or Older," [10/28/22](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0202602578); Wired, [2/17/25](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-social-security-150-year-old-benefits/)\]

#### July 2024: Incorrect Payments From The Social Security Administration Accounted For Less Than One-Percent Of All Benefit Payouts, With Most Being Overpayments To Living People

**HEADLINE: "Tens Of Millions Of Dead People Aren’t Getting Social Security Checks, Despite Trump And Musk Claims"** \[Associated Press, [2/19/25](https://apnews.com/article/social-security-payments-deceased-false-claims-doge-ed2885f5769f368853ac3615b4852cf7)\]

**July 2024: The Social Security Administration’s Inspector General Found Less Than One-Percent Of Payments Were Improper, With Most Incorrect Payments Being Overpayments To Living People.** According to the Associated Press, "A July 2024 report from Social Security’s inspector general states that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, including $71.8 billion — or less than 1% — in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people." \[Associated Press, [2/19/25](https://apnews.com/article/social-security-payments-deceased-false-claims-doge-ed2885f5769f368853ac3615b4852cf7)\]
