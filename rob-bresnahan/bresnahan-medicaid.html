<h2>Despite Promising Not To Vote For A Bill That “Guts The Benefits My Neighbors Rely On,” Bresnahan Voted For Massive Cuts To Medicaid</h2>
<h3>After Getting Elected To Congress, Bresnahan Promised He Would Not Support A Bill That Cut Medicaid</h3>
<p><strong>2/14/25: Bresnahan Promised He Would Not Vote For A Reconciliation Bill That Gutted Medicare Or Medicaid.</strong>&nbsp;According to a press release from Rep. Rob Bresnahan’s office, “Today, U.S. Representative Rob Bresnahan, Jr. (PA-08) released the following statement in response to current budget reconciliation negotiations: ‘I ran for Congress under a promise of always doing what is best for the people of Northeastern Pennsylvania,’ said Rep. Bresnahan. ‘If a bill is put in front of me that guts the benefits my neighbors rely on, I will not vote for it. Pennsylvania’s Eighth District chose me to advocate for them in Congress. These benefits are promises that were made to the people of NEPA and where I come from, people keep their word.’ Pennsylvania’s Eighth Congressional District is home to more than 200,000 Medicaid recipients, amounting to 25% of the district. Additionally, it is home to 66,000 Medicare recipients, and 190,000 Social Security recipients.” [Press Release - Rep. Rob Bresnahan,&nbsp;<a href="https://bresnahan.house.gov/media/press-releases/bresnahan-statement-budget-reconciliation">2/14/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>2/19/25: Bresnahan Joined A Letter To Speaker Johnson Urging Him To Not Cut Medicaid, Food Assistance And Pell Grants.</strong> According to Politico, "Eight House Republicans who are members of the Hispanic conference or represent large Hispanic populations are publicly pressing Speaker Mike Johnson to not slash Medicaid, food assistance and Pell Grants in his budget plan. The group’s new letter to Johnson Wednesday is a serious escalation of private concerns lawmakers have been airing in recent days. House GOP leaders are pressing for rank-and-file lawmakers to back the latest budget plan on the House floor next week — the next step to unlock their massive, party-line bill that spans energy, border and tax policy. GOP Reps. Tony Gonzales (Texas), Monica De La Cruz (Texas), David Valadao (Calif.), Juan Ciscomani (Ariz.), Rob Bresnahan (Pa.), Nicole Malliotakis (N.Y.), along with Dels. James Moylan of Guam and Kimberlyn King-Hinds of the Northern Mariana Islands, sent the letter to Johnson Wednesday. That means six voting members are further complicating Johnson’s plans."

<h3>2/25/25: Bresnahan Voted for The Republican Budget Resolution, Which Set up Future Sweeping Cuts to Medicaid</h3>
<p><strong>2/25/25: Bresnahan Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Framework That Included $2 Trillion In Cuts, Raised The Statutory Debt Limit By $4 Trillion, And Required House Committees To Recommend Legislation That Would Implement Trump’s Agenda.</strong> In February 2025, Bresnahan voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the concurrent resolution that would recommend a budget for fiscal 2025 and budget levels through fiscal 2034. The resolution would assume minimum savings of $1.5 trillion over 10 years and 2.6 percent economic growth over the same period. It also would require the statutory debt limit to be raised by $4 trillion. It also would authorize the House Ways and Means Committee to increase deficits by $4.5 trillion over 10 years to extend the 2017 tax cuts and implement new tax cuts proposed by the White House. It also would provide instructions for the budget reconciliation process through which separate legislation could be considered and passed in the Senate via a simple majority vote. The measure would deliver instructions to 11 House committees to report legislation that would implement President Donald Trump’s agenda, such as expanding tax cuts and bolstering border security and immigration enforcement. The committees would be required to report their legislative recommendations to the House Budget Committee by March 27, 2025. It also would set a $2 trillion target for the spending cuts to be submitted to the House Budget Committee. The resolution also would stipulate that if the committees don't reach that target, the Ways and Means’ reconciliation instructions to increase the deficit by a maximum of $4.5 trillion would be decreased by the amount the other committees come in below the target. Similarly, it would stipulate that Ways and Means could increase the deficit above the $4.5 trillion level by the amount of savings the committees achieve above the $2 trillion target.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 217 to 215.

  <li><strong>New York Times Reported The $880 Billion In Cuts Required By The Republican Budget Proposal Would Have To Come From Medicaid, Medicare Or CHIP.</strong>&nbsp;According to the New York Times, "The budget resolution itself is silent on whether Congress cuts Medicaid, which provides health coverage to 72 million poor and disabled Americans. But it instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the program, to cut spending by $880 billion over the next decade. If the committee can’t save at least that much, the entire effort could be imperiled because of the special process Congress is using to avoid a Senate filibuster. Ten other committees have their own instructions to follow, though none have been assigned with cutting nearly as much.&nbsp; It’s not so simple as finding the cuts elsewhere. The special process, known as budget reconciliation, means Republicans will have to find all $880 billion from within the Energy and Commerce Committee’s jurisdiction. That leaves them with fewer options than one might think. […] If Republicans want to avoid major cuts to Medicaid, the largest pot of available money is in the other big government health insurance program: Medicare. […] Even if the committee cuts everything that’s not health care to $0, it will still be more than $600 billion short.&nbsp; The committee could also save around $200 billion by eliminating the Children’s Health Insurance Program, but that option has not been raised by the budget committee or anyone in House leadership. […] Even if all of these cuts, revenues and rule cancellations from outside health care can pass muster, the committee will still be left with hundreds of billions of dollars to cut to hit its goal. Mathematically, the budget committee’s instructions mean the committee would need to make major cuts to either Medicare, Medicaid or both."

<p><strong>5/22/25: Bresnahan Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Included $3.8 Trillion In Tax Cuts Offset By $1.5 Trillion In Spending Reductions To Programs Like Medicaid And The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</strong> In May 2025, Bresnahan voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would provide for approximately $3.8 trillion in net tax cuts and $321 billion in military, border enforcement and judiciary spending, offset by $1.5 trillion in spending reductions, as instructed in the fiscal 2025 budget resolution. It would raise the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion and provide for increased spending on defense and border security, spending cuts on social safety net programs, such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It also includes a mix of tax breaks for businesses and individuals; tax increases on universities and foundations; and a phase-down of clean energy tax credits. […] It would reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by requiring states to shoulder more of the cost, expand work requirements for SNAP, extend programs authorized under the 2018 farm bill, and prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Program. As amended, it would cap state and local tax deductions at $40,000 for households with incomes below $500,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 215 to 214.

We have been in active dialogue with our long term care providers, our hospitals, all of the various different providers. And when we went into that vote this bill looked very different 48 hours before. There was proposals to reduce FMAP, there was proposals to reduce the provider tax and we would not support it.

<p><strong>Bresnahan Touted His Vote For The Final GOP Budget Bill.</strong>&nbsp;According to a press release from Rep. Rob Bresnahan, “Today, U.S. Representative Rob Bresnahan, Jr. (PA-08) released the following statement after the U.S. House passed the budget reconciliation package by a vote of 218-214. ‘This bill delivers on the promise I made to the people of Northeastern Pennsylvania by providing the largest working-class tax cuts in American history, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime, and securing the southern border.&nbsp;‘We also protect and strengthen Medicaid by cracking down on the fraud, waste, and abuse that is driving the program toward collapse. This ensures Medicaid is there for seniors, people with disabilities, and vulnerable families, not for those who can work but refuse to do so. ‘Most importantly, we worked directly with the White House to ensure all our hospitals in Northeastern Pennsylvania will qualify for the funding they need to stay open and protect critical healthcare access for our communities.’” [Press Release – Rep.

  <li><strong>Bresnahan Touted The Tax Cuts In The Final GOP Budget Bill.</strong>&nbsp;According to the Times Leader, “‘We’re standing up for the working class by making the 2017 pro-worker tax cuts permanent, preventing what would’ve been the largest tax increase in American history,’ Bresnahan said. ‘Raising a family shouldn’t come with a tax penalty. Doubling the Child Tax Credit helps parents keep more of what they earn.’ He also said no tax on tips or overtime means workers get more of their hard-earned money, incentivizing them to earn more. ‘This legislation also gets rid of taxes on auto loan interest for American made cars, putting money back in people’s pockets and supporting our domestic automotive industry,’ Bresnahan said. ‘We’re also providing targeted relief for seniors on Social Security, ensuring retirement income stretches further.’” [Times Leader, <a href="https://www.timesleader.com/news/1706701/rep-bresnahan-explains-his-vote-for-president-trumps-one-big-beautiful-bill">7/5/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Bresnahan Claimed The Final GOP Budget Bill Protected Rural Communities’ Access To Health Care.</strong>&nbsp;According to the Times Leader, “Bresnahan said the legislation protects health care access in rural communities through the Rural Transformation Fund. ‘I met with President Trump, Vice President Vance, CMS Administrator Dr. Oz, and other Administration staff to make sure that this fund would apply to our hospitals in NEPA,’ he said. ‘This $50 billion fund is going to deliver investments directly into hospitals across Northeastern Pennsylvania.’ Bresnahan said that help will be available as early as the beginning of next year, and he said he is looking forward to working to get that money to NEPA hospitals.” [Times Leader, <a href="https://www.timesleader.com/news/1706701/rep-bresnahan-explains-his-vote-for-president-trumps-one-big-beautiful-bill">7/5/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Bresnahan Claimed The Medicaid Changes In The Budget Bill Were A Win And Touted The Work Requirement Carve Outs For Children And Seniors.</strong>&nbsp;According to the Times Leader, “He also said the Medicaid reforms included in the package are a win for those who truly depend on these benefits. ‘It focuses support on the truly vulnerable, while making the system fair,’ he said. ‘Work requirements apply only to able-bodied adults without dependents.’ Bresnahan said many work requirement exemptions exist for children, seniors, veterans, students, pregnant women, individuals with medical conditions or disabilities and others. ‘Anyone who Medicaid was designed to serve will continue to receive those benefits,’ he said. ‘If you can work, you should. And the requirement is 20 hours a week, and it can be fulfilled through school, volunteering, care-giving, apprenticeship programs, and traditional work.’” [Times Leader, <a href="https://www.timesleader.com/news/1706701/rep-bresnahan-explains-his-vote-for-president-trumps-one-big-beautiful-bill">7/5/25</a>]</li>
