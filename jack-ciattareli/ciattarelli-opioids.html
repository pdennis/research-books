Concerns about opioid dependence, addiction, or non-medical use often create barriers to effective pain management.’ But he continued: ‘The risk of opioid misuse is low among patients with chronic pain who do not have preexisting substance use disorders.’” [NJ Advance Media For NJ.com, <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/09/ciattarelli-often-touts-his-main-street-business-on-the-campaign-but-it-was-no-mom-and-pop-operation.html"><u>9/25/21</u></a>]</p>

<h5><i>The Ciattarelli Campaign Spokesperson Said The University Of Tennessee Faculty Brainstormed The Topics For The Continuing Education Content, Not Drug Manufacturers</i></h5>
<p><strong>The Ciattarelli Campaign Spokesperson Said The University Of Tennessee Faculty Brainstormed The Topics For The Continuing Education Content, Not Drug Manufacturers Or Galen, And Galen Submitted A Grant Application With Faculty Input.</strong> According to NJ Advance Media for NJ.com, “Williams said the topics for continuing education came from University of Tennessee faculty and never from drug manufacturers. Galen, she said, then took the idea for a continuing education class, created a grant application with input from faculty and submitted it to pharmaceutical companies with interests in those areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Those companies would either agree to fund the continuing education grant or reject the grant request. If a grant was funded, university faculty responsible for the continuing education program would then prepare the content for the training or for direct publication in the journal,’ she said. ‘The content never focused on a specific drug, but instead addressed all relevant drugs.’” [NJ Advance Media For NJ.com, <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/09/ciattarelli-often-touts-his-main-street-business-on-the-campaign-but-it-was-no-mom-and-pop-operation.html"><u>9/25/21</u></a>]</p>

It’s all advertising and it’s very well disguised,’ said Fugh-Berman, who heads PharmedOut, a group that monitors pharmaceutical industry marketing efforts.” [NJ Advance Media For NJ.com, <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/09/ciattarelli-often-touts-his-main-street-business-on-the-campaign-but-it-was-no-mom-and-pop-operation.html"><u>9/25/21</u></a>]</p>
