<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Ciattarelli claimed to take a “libertarian” approach to abortion rights, but ultimately supported a 20-week abortion ban, claiming that was when fetuses began to feel pain. He also opposed state funding of Planned Parenthood, and instead uplifted anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers. Ciattarelli opposed both the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act and the first version of abortion rights legislation, the Reproductive Freedom Act. Ciattarelli called the Reproductive Freedom Act “extreme,” comparing it to extreme abortion bans, and “radical” for easing restrictions on abortion and expanding access to abortion providers.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Ciattarelli Claimed To Take A “Libertarian” Approach To Abortion Rights</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2024: Ciattarelli Claimed That, As A Libertarian, He Believed Abortion Was “A Deeply Personal Decision Between A Woman, Her Partner, Her Medical Professionals, And Her God If She So Believes.” </strong>According to a Jack Ciattarelli interview with State of Affairs with Steve Adubato, “HOST: Supreme Court is a couple of years ago they decided on Roe v. Wade. They overturned it. What is your view of what the state policy should be? It was codified, if you will, the right to a legal abortion in the state of Jersey. Would you in any way attempt to change that? CIATTARELLI: My position hasn't changed on this issue, Steve. I've got a very strong libertarian streak and us libertarians do not like big government involved in deeply personal decisions. I believe this is a deeply personal decision between a woman, her partner, her medical professionals and her God if she so believes. And so I've always respected a woman's right to choose.” [Jack Ciattarelli Interview – State of Affairs with Steve Adubato, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZC_BuGtbuk"><u>7/6/24</u></a>] (VIDEO)&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2021: New Jersey Right To Life Cautiously Recommended Ciattarelli For Governor But Declined To Fully Endorse Him Because He Claimed To Support Abortion Rights. </strong>According to The New Jersey Globe, “New Jersey Right to Life PAC&nbsp;cautiously ‘recommended’&nbsp;Jack Ciattarelli in his 2021 campaign to unseat Gov.

<h4><strong><u>Ciattarelli Claimed That He Supported A Woman’s Right To An Abortion, Yet He Supported A 20-Week Abortion Ban</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2021: Ciattarelli Said That He Would Support Banning Abortions After 20 Weeks, Said He Supported Parental Notification, And Said He Opposed Tax-Payer Funded Abortion Services.</strong> According to Jack Ciattarelli on an episode of WPG Talk Radio, “If Roe V. Wade is overturned in Washington, Frank, it is going to be turned back to the states. And at that time, I'll sit down with our Republican majority in the legislature to see where we want to go. I certainly support the Steve Oroho, Joe Pennacchio bill that would disavow any and all abortions after the 20-week mark, which is the mark at which our science and our medical professionals tell us that the fetus experiences pain. I certainly believe in parental notification. I don't think taxpayer dollars should ever be used for abortions.”<strong> </strong>[Jack Ciattarelli Interview – WPG Talk Radio, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/horton-mcdaniel/jack-ciattarelli-wpg-talk-radio-4172021/s-O5J4K9LC1N5?si=651253e91264484f876fdac90ae717f2&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>4/17/21</u></a>] (AUDIO)<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>2021: Ciattarelli Called For Restricting Abortion Later In Pregnancy, Said That Parents Should Be Notified If Their Child Wants To Get An Abortion, And Said He Opposed The Expansion Of Abortion Providers. </strong>According to Jack Ciattarelli in an episode of IndusTV, “First of all, I support the agencies that provide healthcare to thousands of women across the state and I also support a woman’s right to choose. I do think there need to be restrictions. I don’t know of anybody across the state of New Jersey that believes they shouldn’t be notified if their teen daughter is pregnant and seeking an abortion. But I do respect a woman’s right to choose with restriction, with restrictions. The science says the developing baby feels pain after five months if there's an abortion. The science says that developing baby is viable outside the womb after five months. I believe in parental notification. Phil Murphy does not. Phil Murphy believes that abortion should be performed right up until the day of birth in months seven, eight, nine, and have it performed by somebody other than an M.D., which would put the woman's life at stake if there were complications. New Jerseyans don't believe that, nor do I.”<strong> </strong>[Jack Ciattarelli Interview – IndusTV (New Jersey), <a href="https://youtu.be/8LrTUtDENyg"><u>10/27/21</u></a>] (VIDEO)&nbsp;</p>
<h5><i>Ciattarelli Couched His So-Called Support For Abortion Rights With His Support For Abortion Restrictions</i></h5>
<p><strong>2021: Ciattarelli Claimed He “Never Not Advocated For A Woman’s Right To Choose” But Went On To Say He Supported A Parental Notification Law For Minors And Supported A Ban On Abortion After 20 Weeks. </strong>According to The Star Ledger, “Ciattarelli: ‘I have never not advocated for a woman's right to choose.’&nbsp;Ciattarelli made this statement during the first debate last month. But when questioned further, he said he supports a parental notification law for minors — a requirement in 10 other states — and a ban on abortion after 20 weeks, which 17 states have enacted, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.” [Star Ledger, <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/10/why-abortion-rights-matter-more-in-the-nj-governors-race-this-year-than-ever-before.html"><u>10/16/21</u></a>]&nbsp;</p>
<h5><i>Opinion Pieces Highlighted Ciattarelli’s Support For Restricting Abortion At 20 Weeks And Restricting Planned Parenthood Funding</i></h5>
<p><strong>Star-Ledger Editorial Board Opinion: Ciattarelli Favored A Ban On Abortions After 20 Weeks And Supported Christie’s Policy To Cut Funding For Planned Parenthood. </strong>According to a Star-Ledger Editorial Board opinion, “There is a consensus that&nbsp;abortion&nbsp;rights are safe in New Jersey, and that nothing is likely to dim the beacon of freedom that our state represents for any woman who needs access to&nbsp;reproductive&nbsp;health care.&nbsp;The reality is more sobering. In a post-Roe nation, where 21 states have imposed full bans or significant restrictions on&nbsp;abortion&nbsp;rights, New Jersey could be only a few election cycles away from severe curtailment or a possible elimination of those rights, and all you have to do is listen to the politicians who want to make that happen. […] They are reminders that anti-abortion&nbsp;politicians have always been certain that they are better equipped than a woman and her doctor to determine whether a&nbsp;pregnancy&nbsp;should be carried to term, and as Chris Christie proved for eight years, some Republicans have no misgivings about making&nbsp;reproductive&nbsp;health care available only to the wealthy by erasing funding for Planned Parenthood.&nbsp;We know this because they introduce such bills almost every year.&nbsp;So ask yourself again what can happen if the Assembly and Senate turn over next month, followed by the 2025 election of a governor like&nbsp;Jack&nbsp;Ciattarelli, who favors a ban on&nbsp;abortions&nbsp;after 20 weeks and supported Christie's cut to family planning services.” [Editorial Board Opinion – Star-Ledger, <a href="https://www.nj.com/opinion/2023/10/make-no-mistake-abortion-is-on-the-nj-ballot-this-year-editorial.html"><u>10/22/23</u></a>]&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tom Moran Opinion: Ciattarelli Wanted To Ban Abortion After 20 Weeks And Eliminate Funding For Planned Parenthood, Saying He Would Instead Fund “Federal Health Centers.” </strong>According to a Tom Moran Opinion from The Star-Ledger, “The Supreme Court’s midnight decision to support a Texas ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy is bad news for women in the state, who will have to flee across the border to secure what was a Constitutional right until last week. […] Finally, the Texas decision is bad news for Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican candidate for governor, who wants to ban abortions after 20 weeks, in violation of the 24-week protection spelled out in Roe v. Wade. He would also eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, saying he would plug the gap in women’s health care by funding federal health centers instead.” [Tom Moran Opinion – Star-Ledger, <a href="https://www.nj.com/opinion/2021/09/texas-abortion-ruling-will-hurt-ciattarelli-moran.html"><u>9/5/21</u></a>]&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>Ciattarelli Spread False Information About Abortions, Claiming Fetuses Began To Feel Pain After 20 Weeks</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2021: Ciattarelli Said That Science Proved A Fetus Could Feel Pain During An Abortion After 20 Weeks Despite Studies Showing That A Fetus Did Not Have The Capacity To Feel Pain Until At Least 24 Weeks Of Gestation. </strong>According to The Star Ledger, “‘We know the baby feels pain during an abortion after 20 weeks. That's the science,’ Ciattarelli said.&nbsp;But is it? According to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, ‘A human fetus does not have the capacity to experience pain until after viability.’&nbsp;‘Rigorous scientific studies have found that the connections necessary to transmit signals from peripheral sensory nerves to the brain, as well as the brain structures necessary to process those signals, do not develop until at least 24 weeks of gestation,’ according to a statement on the medical association's website, addressing the Trump administration.” [Star Ledger, <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2021/10/why-abortion-rights-matter-more-in-the-nj-governors-race-this-year-than-ever-before.html"><u>10/16/21</u></a>]&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2021: Ciattarelli Said He Supported Restricting Abortions After 20 Weeks Because He Believed In “The Science” That Claimed At That Stage The Developing Fetus Began To Feel Pain. </strong>According to a Jack Ciattarelli interview with News 12 New Jersey, “I don't support the Texas law. I think it's a bit extreme. But at the same time, what's extreme is Phil Murphy's position on abortion. He doesn't believe in parental notification. I do. And I think most parents do. And he also believes, because he keeps asking for Steve Sweeney to put that abortion law on his desk, he believes abortions should be performed in months seven, eight, nine, and even have it performed by somebody other than an M.D. That's not where New Jersey is. That too is extremism. I've never advocated for overturning Roe v. Wade. I've always respected a woman's right to choose. But I also respect the science, which says after 20 weeks, five months, that the developing baby begins to feel pain. And so let's have restrictions on abortion, but let's not necessarily overturn Roe v. Wade.” [Jack Ciattarelli Interview – News 12 New Jersey, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh0SHSirQcw"><u>9/25/21</u></a>] (VIDEO)&nbsp;</p>

And while he has policies on culture war issues like abortion and immigration, he says that's not where his focus lies.&nbsp;‘I have an obligation to speak to those issues whenever anyone asks, but I think the reason why I've won seven races in this state, all in contests where Democrats outnumber Republicans, is because I focus on the two issues that matter most to people: opportunity and security,’ Ciattarelli said in an interview. ‘I think a commonsense, conservative approach to government and ... lower taxes better provide opportunity and security.’” [The Hill, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/564023-seeking-red-gains-in-blue-jersey/"><u>7/21/21</u></a>]</p>

And that raises the temperature on an issue where Ciattarelli has no natural allies in New Jersey.&nbsp;Matthew Hale, a political scientist at Seton Hall University, says Ciattarelli alienates pro-choice voters by favoring restrictions, and alienates pro-life voters by supporting abortion rights under some conditions. ‘He doesn’t gain on either end,’ Hale says.” [Tom Moran Opinion – Star-Ledger, <a href="https://www.nj.com/opinion/2021/09/texas-abortion-ruling-will-hurt-ciattarelli-moran.html"><u>9/5/21</u></a>]&nbsp;</p>

Abortions should not be funded with taxpayer money.’&nbsp;‘I will tell you that since Planned Parenthood arrived on the scene there have been a number of other very urgent matters that have arisen in the community,’ replied Ciattarelli, in perhaps the most pointed exchange of the night. ‘When I think about homeless veterans, beds for drug addicts, the lack of mental health services in the community, we are at peak demand for mental health services.

<p><strong>The Reproductive Freedom Act Did Not “Expand The Window Of Time A Woman May Seek An Abortion,” But Lifted Some Bureaucratic Credentialing Requirements To Expand Access To Abortion Providers, And Allowed Advance Practice Nurses To Perform First-Trimester Abortions, While Still Requiring A Doctor To Perform Second- And Third-Trimester Abortions. </strong>According to NJ.com, “The Reproductive Freedom Act would not expand the window of time a woman may seek an abortion, said Roxanne Sutocky, Patient Advocate and Director of Community Engagement, Cherry Hill Women’s Center. New Jersey law has never banned abortion at any point in pregnancy.&nbsp;But ‘old and outdated’ state regulations have created a de facto ban, Sutocky said.&nbsp;The bill would lift some of the bureaucratic credentialing requirements that require doctors who perform later abortions to apply to the state Board of Medical Examiners and demonstrate ‘superior training and experience,’ as well as proof of support staff and facilities deemed adequate to accommodate the increased risks of providing this service.&nbsp;In Cherry Hill, only two doctors meet this requirement, and they are permitted to perform abortions up to 24 weeks and six days, Sutocky said. […] New Jersey regulations allow only physicians to perform aspiration abortions, a first-trimester procedure, Sutocky said.
