<h3><strong>Harrigan Defended The DOGE Cuts&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Harrigan Claimed That The DOGE Cuts Saved Taxpayers “A Substantial Amount Of Money.” </strong>According to the Washington Reporter, “Washington Reporter: How has the DOGE agenda helped your district? Rep. Pat Harrigan: It has saved the American taxpayer a substantial amount of money. They have really shined a light on the waste, fraud, and abuse that exist within government that have been systemic, long term abuses of taxpayer dollars. Curbing this allows for the long term stability of these programs and allows for important programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, that ordinary Americans count on, to be preserved for the people who have earned those benefits.” [Washington Reporter, <a href="https://washingtonreporter.news/p/interview-15-house-republicans-on"><u>4/29/25</u></a>]</p>

<p><strong>[Transcript] Pat Harrigan Defended Precedent For Federal Workforce Reductions</strong> According to CNN: This Morning, “when you look back at historical changes that have happened with our federal workforce, I’d point back to 1995 with President Clinton when he let 400,000 federal workers go to make things a little bit leaner, a little bit meaner.
