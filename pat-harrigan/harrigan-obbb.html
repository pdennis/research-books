<h2><strong>Harrigan Voted For The Big Ugly Bill</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Harrigan Supported The GOP’s Big Ugly Bill&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Harrigan Voted For The House Version Of “One Big Beautiful Bill”&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2025: Harrigan Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Included $3.8 Trillion In Tax Cuts Offset By $1.5 Trillion In Spending Reductions To Programs Like Medicaid And The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</strong> In May 2025, Harrigan voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would provide for approximately $3.8 trillion in net tax cuts and $321 billion in military, border enforcement and judiciary spending, offset by $1.5 trillion in spending reductions, as instructed in the fiscal 2025 budget resolution. It would raise the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion and provide for increased spending on defense and border security, spending cuts on social safety net programs, such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It also includes a mix of tax breaks for businesses and individuals; tax increases on universities and foundations; and a phase-down of clean energy tax credits. […] It would reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by requiring states to shoulder more of the cost, expand work requirements for SNAP, extend programs authorized under the 2018 farm bill, and prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Program. As amended, it would cap state and local tax deductions at $40,000 for households with incomes below $500,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 215 to 214. [House Vote 145, <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml"><u>5/22/25</u></a>; Congressional Quarterly, <a href="https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/145?4"><u>5/22/25</u></a>; Congressional Actions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions"><u>H.R. 1</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Bill Reduced Medicaid Funding By $625 Billion Over 10 Years And Imposed Work, Volunteer, And Education Requirements On Adult Recipients And Prohibited Medicaid From Covering Gender Affirming Care. According to Congressional Quarterly, “It would reduce spending on Medicaid by $625 billion over a 10-year period and modify eligibility and cost provisions for enrollees and health providers and impose work, volunteer and education requirements on adults ages 19 to 64 who are covered by the program. […] [The bill] prohibit[ed] Medicaid funding for gender transition therapies or procedures for minors and adults, among other provisions.” [Congressional Quarterly, </strong><a href="https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/145?4"><strong><u>5/22/25</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><u>Harrigan Voted for The Senate Version Of The “One Big Beautiful Bill”&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Harrigan Voted For The Senate Version Of The “One Big Beautiful Bill.” </strong>According to a press release from Congressman Pat Harrigan, “Today, Congressman Pat Harrigan (NC-10) voted to pass H.R.1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, landmark legislation that delivers the largest tax cut in American history, locks down the southern border, and restores fiscal and military strength after years of Democrat failure.” [Press Release – Congressman Pat Harrigan, <a href="https://harrigan.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-pat-harrigan-applauds-passage-one-big-beautiful-bill"><u>7/2/25</u></a>]</p>
<h3><strong>The GOP’s Big Ugly Bill Hurt North Carolina</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>North Carolina Lost $32 Billion In Federal Funding And Over 650,000 North Carolinians Were Set To Lose Their Insurance Coverage From The Bill’s Medicaid Cuts</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>North Carolina Was Set To Lose $32 Billion In Federal Funding Over The Next Decade And Over 650,000 North Carolinians Would Lose Their Insurance Coverage. </strong>According to the Guardian, “North Carolina is set to lose $32bn in federal funding in the next decade, according to an analysis by the office of the Republican senator Thom Tillis, who represents the state. He’s one of just three Senate Republicans who voted against the bill on Tuesday. North Carolina’s expansion only went into effect in December 2023, and in less than 19 months it enrolled more than 650,000 people – all of whom will lose coverage if the program ends.” [Guardian, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/04/rural-americans-medicaid-cuts-trump-bill"><u>7/4/25</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Governor Stein Said That The Bill Could Cause Half-Million North Carolinians Losing Healthcare Coverage. </strong>According to the Citizen Times, “In a July 3 statement released after the bill’s passage in the House, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said the bill could result in more than a half-million North Carolinians losing health care coverage while leaving 1.4 million people unable to afford food.” [Citizen Times, <a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2025/07/08/big-beautiful-bill-critics-worry-about-west-north-carolina-health-food-access/84495172007/"><u>7/9/25</u></a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Bill Mandated Eligibility Checks Every Six Months For Medicaid Expansion Recipients And Required Certain Recipients To Pay A Portion Of Their Care. According to CNN, “The package also mandates states to check Medicaid expansion enrollees’ eligibility every six months, instead of annually, and to require that certain low-income adults covered under Medicaid expansion pay for a portion of their care.” [CNN, </strong><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/what-is-in-trump-tax-spending-cuts-package"><strong><u>5/28/25</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>States That Expanded Medicaid Or Use State Funds To Cover Undocumented Immigrants Would Face A 20 Percent Reduction In Federal Medicaid Funding. According to CNN, “In addition, the legislation would penalize states that have expanded Medicaid and that provide Medicaid coverage to undocumented immigrants using state funds. These states would see a 10% reduction in their federal matching funds for the expansion population. Several states, including California, New York, Utah and Illinois, cover undocumented children, adults or both in state health plans.” [CNN, </strong><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/what-is-in-trump-tax-spending-cuts-package"><strong><u>5/28/25</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The Bill Postponed The Biden Administration Rule That Streamlined Medicaid Eligibility And Enrollment. According to CNN, “The package would postpone implementation of a Biden administration rule aimed at streamlining Medicaid eligibility and enrollment until 2035. Such a delay would make it harder for people to enroll in the program and renew their coverage.” [CNN, </strong><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/what-is-in-trump-tax-spending-cuts-package"><strong><u>5/28/25</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The Bill Codified A Trump Administration Proposal That Restricted Access To Obamacare. According to CNN, “The bill also calls for codifying a Trump administration proposal that would make changes to the Affordable Care Act enrollment process, including shortening the open enrollment period and eliminating the ability of low-income Americans to sign up year-round.” [CNN, </strong><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/what-is-in-trump-tax-spending-cuts-package"><strong><u>5/28/25</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The Bill Was Estimated To Increase The Uninsured Population By 8.6 Million By 2034. According to CNN, “The Medicaid and Affordable Care Act provisions in the package could result in 8.6 million more people being uninsured in 2034, according to an early CBO estimate released by Democratic lawmakers. That number is expected to grow with the latest changes.” [CNN, </strong><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/what-is-in-trump-tax-spending-cuts-package"><strong><u>5/28/25</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The Work Requirement Would Effectively Result In Adults With Jobs Losing Coverage. According to CNN, “The new Medicaid work requirements are expected to result in millions of people losing their health care coverage, multiple analyses have shown. While many adults on Medicaid have jobs, they may have trouble meeting the reporting requirements, obtaining exemptions or landing enough hours each month to maintain their eligibility.” [CNN, </strong><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/what-is-in-trump-tax-spending-cuts-package"><strong><u>5/28/25</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><u>The Bill Put Rural North Carolina Hospitals At Risk&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Five Rural Hospitals In North Carolina Were At Risk Of Closure. </strong>According to WRAL, “The research noted that 338 rural hospitals nationwide were at risk of closing. […] Five hospitals in North Carolina made the list, including Person Memorial in Roxboro and UNC Health Chatham in Siler City.” [WRAL, <a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/nc-rural-hospitals-risk-closure-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-june-2025/"><u>6/16/25</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Bill Likely Would Prevent Martin General Hospital From Reopening. </strong>According to the New York Times, “But those plans are now in jeopardy, as is Medicaid coverage for hundreds of thousands of North Carolina residents, after Congress passed President Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill. To help pay for tax cuts, the bill slashes federal spending on Medicaid, leaving states that expanded the program under Obamacare in a particularly difficult spot. If Medicaid expansion is eliminated in North Carolina, Martin General Hospital almost surely will not reopen” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/06/us/north-carolina-medicaid-cuts.html"><u>7/6/25</u></a>]</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><u>1.4 Million North Carolinians, Including 600,000 Children, Lost Food Assistance Under The Bill’s Changes To The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>NC Health News Claimed That The Bill’s SNAP Cuts “Could Leave 1.4 Million North Carolina Residents — 600,000 Of Whom Are Children — Without Food Assistance.”</strong> According to NC Health news, “Changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, could leave 1.4 million North Carolina residents — 600,000 of whom are children — without food assistance. [...] In North Carolina, there are more than 1.4 million participants in the SNAP program, Karen Wade, the state Department of Health and Human Services policy director, said during the July 1 media briefing. The federal legislation expands work requirements that already are part of the program, she added. ‘Our programs serve a range of populations, including older adults, veterans, individuals with disabilities and children, and it’s also important to note that these are working families, with an average of 80 percent of SNAP households including someone who’s working,’ Wade said. Since SNAP’s establishment as a countrywide program 50 years ago, the benefits have been 100 percent federally funded. Wade noted, though, that the new federal law shifts hundreds of millions of dollars annually in costs to the state and counties in North Carolina — ‘a new unprecedented mandate.’” [NC Health News, <a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2025/07/10/big-beautiful-bill-impacts/"><u>7/10/25</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>The Bill’s SNAP Cuts Added “At Least $425 Million In New Costs” For North Carolina And Forced Consideration Of Enrollment Reductions Or Withdrawal From The SNAP Program. </strong>According to NC Health news, “That could add at least $425 million in new costs for the state under the final version of the law. The state is also on the hook for an additional $65 million for program administration — now that the law increases the state’s responsibility from 25 percent to 50 percent. The state now faces tough choices, which could include: Shifting state budget funds to cover the federal gap. Reducing enrollment to lower costs. Withdrawing from the SNAP program.” [NC Health News, <a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2025/07/10/big-beautiful-bill-impacts/"><u>7/10/25</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>North Carolina’s Department Of Health And Human Services Policy Director Claimed That “Hunger And Poverty Would Increase, Along With Worsening Health Outcomes,” If The State Withdrew From SNAP. </strong>According to NC Health news, “If the state were to withdraw from SNAP, Wade told reporters on July 1, ‘hunger and poverty would increase, along with worsening health outcomes.’ ‘SNAP is also an important economic driver to our state,’ Wade added.” [NC Health News, <a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2025/07/10/big-beautiful-bill-impacts/"><u>7/10/25</u></a>]</li>

<h5><i>The Reduction in SNAP Funding Threatened Rural North Carolina Grocery Stores</i></h5>
<p><strong>NC Health News Claimed That “Rural Grocery Stores That Depend On SNAP For Revenue Would Be At Risk Of Closure, And Jobs Generated By Those Would Be At Risk Across The State.” </strong>According to NC Health news, “According to DHHS estimates, North Carolina stands to lose $2.8 billion in annual federal funds that generate $4.2 billion in economic impact. Rural grocery stores that depend on SNAP for revenue would be at risk of closure, and jobs generated by those would be at risk across the state.” [NC Health News, <a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2025/07/10/big-beautiful-bill-impacts/"><u>7/10/25</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>The Bill’s Revised Clean Energy Tax Credits Raised North Carolinians’ Energy Prices And Reduced The State’s New Electric Capacity</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>The Big Ugly Bill “Would Increase Annual Energy Bills By $1.3 Billion Across North Carolina Households Annually In 2030, Swelling To $3.3 Billion In Higher Energy Costs By 2035, For A Total Of $13 Billion During The Budget Window Of 2025 To 2034.”</strong> According to Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, “We find the House OBBBA as passed would increase annual energy bills by $1.3 billion across North Carolina households annually in 2030, swelling to $3.3 billion in higher energy costs by 2035, for a total of $13 billion during the budget window of 2025 to 2034. This is due to higher dependence on fossil fuels and higher fossil fuel prices. Although the House OBBBA leads to more fossil fuel production, prices still exhibit a net increase, as increased demand would raise prices more than increased domestic supply could lower them.” [Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/Impacts-Of-The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-On-North-Carolina-Energy-Costs-Jobs-Health-And-Emissions_FINAL.pdf"><u>6/2025</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>North Carolinians Faced A $360 Increase On Their Annual Vehicle Fuel Costs And A 29% Increase In Their Electric Costs.</strong> According to Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, “Some fuels see greater price increases than others; in North Carolina in 2035, we find a $0.28 per gallon increase in gasoline (approximately 9.4 percent), 18- and 2.3-percent increases in residential electricity and natural gas prices, respectively, and 29- and 5.5-percent increases in electricity and natural gas prices for industrial producers, respectively. We find the average North Carolina household will spend $150 more on annual vehicle fuel alone in 2030 and $360 annually in 2035.” [Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/Impacts-Of-The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-On-North-Carolina-Energy-Costs-Jobs-Health-And-Emissions_FINAL.pdf"><u>6/2025</u></a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology: “The Bill Would Increase Household Energy Spending By An Average Of More Than $290 Per Year In 2030 And Nearly $700 Per Year In 2035.”</strong> According to Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, “Increased capital, fuel, and operating expenses from the OBBBA would raise North Carolina consumer energy bills, forcing households to pay more for their electricity and natural gas. The bill would increase household energy spending by an average of more than $290 per year in 2030 and nearly $700 per year in 2035. Statewide, households will foot $16 billion in increased energy bills through 2035.” [Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/Impacts-Of-The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-On-North-Carolina-Energy-Costs-Jobs-Health-And-Emissions_FINAL.pdf"><u>6/2025</u></a>]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bill Reduced North Carolina’s Cumulative New Electric Capacity “By 13 Gigawatts” By 2030 And “25 GW By 2035.”</strong> According to Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, “Collectively, these changes would dramatically slow deployment of new electricity generating capacity in North Carolina at a time of rapidly growing electricity demand – total U.S. demand is forecast to increase 16 percent, or 128 GW, in the next four years. Compared to the Current Policies scenario, the House OBBBA would decrease cumulative new electricity capacity in North Carolina by 13 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 and 25 GW by 2035.” [Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/Impacts-Of-The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-On-North-Carolina-Energy-Costs-Jobs-Health-And-Emissions_FINAL.pdf"><u>6/2025</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>North Carolina Business Owners Warned That “The Grid Needs Power, And Solar Is One Of The Fastest That You Can Implement.” </strong>According to WSOC-TV, “Bill Taylor, the owner of DCE Solar, said when he started the company in Cornelius 16 years ago, he was seeing nearly 20% growth year to year as the solar industry was growing across the country. In recent years, he says it had really taken off thanks both to the tax credits established in the 2022 IRA and a sudden surge in energy demand. ‘We’re all plugging in as consumers. We’ve got more devices. We’re trying to create more manufacturing here,’ he said. ‘The grid needs power, and solar is one of the fastest that you can implement.’” [WSOC-TV, <a href="https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/north-carolinas-clean-energy-sector-raises-alarm-cuts-big-beautiful-bill/DDDDT4QKJRHT3MOCQ53UJATRVA/"><u>7/2/25</u></a>]</li>

<h4><strong><u>The Big Ugly Bill Slashed North Carolina Jobs And Shrunk The State’s GDP By Over $66.5 Billion</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>The Bill’s Revised Energy Tax Credits “Would Cost North Carolina’s Workforce Over 45,000 Jobs In 2030 And More Than 42,000 Jobs In 2035.”</strong> According to Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, “The changes envisioned by this bill would cost North Carolina’s workforce over 45,000 jobs in 2030 and more than 42,000 jobs in 2035 as new investment in domestic energy and manufacturing falters.” [Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/Impacts-Of-The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-On-North-Carolina-Energy-Costs-Jobs-Health-And-Emissions_FINAL.pdf"><u>6/2025</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Job Loss Projections Were “Likely Conservative” And Stemmed From Canceled Projects And “Lower Induced Economic Activity.”</strong> According to Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, “This includes losing direct jobs from decreased investments in clean energy projects, indirect jobs from lower demand for the inputs to those projects, and induced jobs from lower induced economic activity (e.g., higher fuel costs mean consumers have less money to re-spend in the economy). These numbers are likely conservative because we only explicitly model the potential cancellation of domestic battery manufacturing facilities, not other advanced manufacturing projects.” [Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/Impacts-Of-The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-On-North-Carolina-Energy-Costs-Jobs-Health-And-Emissions_FINAL.pdf"><u>6/2025</u></a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Bill Slashed The State’s Battery Manufacturing Output And “Would Cost North Carolina 4,000 Battery Manufacturing Jobs By 2030.”</strong> According to Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, “We estimate this change would result in the loss of approximately 31 GWh of battery manufacturing in North Carolina by 2032. Companies selling EVs in the U.S. would increasingly rely on foreign sourced batteries and minerals, and fewer domestic factories would export to other countries. Losing these announced facilities means the OBBBA would cost North Carolina 4,000 battery manufacturing jobs by 2030.” [Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/Impacts-Of-The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-On-North-Carolina-Energy-Costs-Jobs-Health-And-Emissions_FINAL.pdf"><u>6/2025</u></a>]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>North Carolina’s Cumulative GDP “Would Shrink By $66.68 Billion” Between 2025 And 2034 Under The Big Ugly Bill’s Revised Energy Tax Credits.</strong> According to Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, “Annual GDP in North Carolina would shrink by $8.7 billion in 2030 and $9.4 billion in 2035. Between 2025 and 2034 – the Reconciliation budget window – cumulative GDP would shrink by $66.68 billion in North Carolina.” [Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/Impacts-Of-The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-On-North-Carolina-Energy-Costs-Jobs-Health-And-Emissions_FINAL.pdf"><u>6/2025</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Revised Tax Credits “Will Force Developers To Cancel A Significant Number Of The Announced Clean Energy Manufacturing Facilities While Significantly Delaying Clean Electricity Deployment.”</strong> According to Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, “Changes to funding and tax credits in the OBBBA will force developers to cancel a significant number of the announced clean energy manufacturing facilities while significantly delaying clean electricity deployment. The OBBBA provisions modeled would shrink GDP by $67 billion across the budget window from 2025 to 2034 in North Carolina as clean energy manufacturing and construction projects fail.” [Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/Impacts-Of-The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-On-North-Carolina-Energy-Costs-Jobs-Health-And-Emissions_FINAL.pdf"><u>6/2025</u></a>]</li>
  <li><strong>North Carolina Business Owners Were “Sounding The Alarm About Provisions In The Bill Focused On Clean Energy They Say Could Undermine Job Growth In The State And Increase The Cost Of Energy.” </strong>According to WSOC-TV, North Carolina’s clean energy sector is sounding the alarm about provisions in the bill focused on clean energy they say could undermine job growth in the state and increase the cost of energy. The bill, which is focused on extending the 2017 tax cuts passed during the first Trump administration, also included significant cuts to clean energy incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act which sought to grow renewable power generation and onshore manufacturing in the EV, battery and solar sectors.” [WSOC-TV, <a href="https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/north-carolinas-clean-energy-sector-raises-alarm-cuts-big-beautiful-bill/DDDDT4QKJRHT3MOCQ53UJATRVA/"><u>7/2/25</u></a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Asheville-Based Sugar Hollow Solar Claimed The Bill Was “Going To Be Bad For Our Economy And Just Overall In Our Industry” And Predicted “There Are Going To Be Some Job Losses.” </strong>According to the Citizen Times, “Though only a few employees milled about the West Asheville-based renewable energy provider on July 10, Sugar Hollow Solar is busy these days. All of the company's vans were out on job sites, making solar panel installations on hot rooftops or maintaining systems. Despite steady business, shifting federal policies have the company of around 65 people bracing for impact. Federal support for residential solar panel installations will wind down later this year. ‘It's going to be bad for our economy and just overall in our industry,’ Sugar Hollow Solar's co-founder and CEO Doug Ager said. ‘There are going to be some job losses.’” [Citizen Times, <a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/2025/07/14/asheville-north-carolina-solar-power-panel-company-warns-of-big-beautiful-bill-impacts/84502841007/"><u>7/14/25</u></a>]</li>
