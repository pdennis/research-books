<h2><strong>Harrigan District-Hopped, Lied About His Residency, And Neglected To File Required Financial Disclosures</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Harrigan Claimed That He Planned To Live In The 14th District “Whether He Wins Or Loses” But Abandoned His 2024 Campaign, And His Plans To Move, For The Safer 10th District Where He Already Lived</strong></h3>
<p><strong>October 2022: Harrigan’s Spokesman Claimed That He Planned To Move To The 14th District “Whether He Wins Or Loses But Hasn’t Been Able To Sell His Home Because Interest Rates Are Too High.” </strong>According to the North State Journal, “A spokesman for Harrigan also said he had planned to move to the 14th District ‘whether he wins or loses but hasn’t been able to sell his home because interest rates are too high.’ However, Harrigan’s history since that story has been a move to Gaston County, where he voted in a 2023 municipal election in Gastonia, and a move back to a residence in Catawba County after McHenry’s retirement announcement.” [North State Journal, <a href="https://nsjonline.com/article/2024/02/representing-or-renting-residency-questions-become-an-issue-in-republican-congressional-primaries/"><u>2/7/24</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Harrigan’s Advisor Claimed That He “Absolutely” Intended To Live In The 14th District Permanently And That Harrigan Was Waiting For His Catawba County Home To Sell. </strong>According to The Charlotte Observer, “Shaw said Harrigan ‘absolutely’ intends to live in the district permanently, and that Harrigan put his Catawba County home on the market in the early spring. Harrigan and his family are still waiting for the house to sell.” [Charlotte Observer, <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article266911781.html#storylink=cpy"><u>10/6/22</u></a>]&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>August 2023: Harrigan Declared His Candidacy In The Newly Gerrymandered 14th District. </strong>According to Politico, “Jackson, a former prosecutor and veteran serving his first term in Congress, represents NC-14, one of four significantly redrawn districts under the new congressional map Republicans adopted Wednesday. The current congressional delegation is split 7-7, but the new map draws 10 districts that are safe GOP seats, three that are safe Democratic districts and one that is competitive. The newly redrawn NC-14 would have voted 58 percent for former President Donald Trump in 2020 — a reversal from the blue-leaning district that Jackson won in 2022. [...] Republican state House Speaker Tim Moore is considering a bid for NC-14, and Republican Pat Harrigan, who lost to Jackson by around 15 points in 2022, has been in the race since August.” [Politico, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/26/jeff-jackson-north-carolina-attorney-general-00123751"><u>10/26/23</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>December 2023: Harrigan Dropped His Bid In The 14th District And Declared His Candidacy In The, Safer, 10th District Where His Daughters Had Spent “Their Entire Lives” And Where His Lake House Was Located.</strong> According to WCNC, “This week, Republican congressional candidate Pat Harrigan announced he was switching his candidacy to run in the 10th Congressional District, dropping his bid for the 14th district seat. ‘We've always had a home on Lake Hickory. This is near and dear place to our heart. My daughters, their entire lives had been in school in Hickory. It's where my wife and I go to church,’ Harrigan said on WCNC's Flashpoint. [...] Harrigan's announcement came shortly after incumbent Rep. Patrick McHenry that he wouldn't run for reelection in the 10th district, ending a 20-year career in the U.S. House.&nbsp; Initially, Harrigan was running in the 14th district, which covers Gastonia and Kings Mountain, and faced a tough primary race against N.C. House Speaker Tim Moore.” [WCNC, <a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/politics/flashpoint/harrigan-defends-switch-10th-district-congressional-race/275-a4f872cf-bfed-4767-8561-0915fbf1a0d4"><u>12/10/23</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>December 2023: Harrigan Registered To Vote In Catawba County. </strong>According to the North State Journal, “Harrigan unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2022 and was the GOP nominee in the 14th District, which encompassed areas of Mecklenburg County, Gaston County and others along the state’s southern border. He has been registered in Catawba, Mecklenburg and Gaston counties since 2020, most recently registering again in Catawba County on Dec. 4, 2023.” [North State Journal, <a href="https://nsjonline.com/article/2024/02/representing-or-renting-residency-questions-become-an-issue-in-republican-congressional-primaries/"><u>2/7/24</u></a>]</li>

<h3><strong>Harrigan’s 2022 Opponent, Asked The Mecklenburg County Board Of Elections To Investigate Whether Harrigan Was Fraudulently Registered To Vote In The County</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Jeff Jackson, Harrigan’s Opponent, Asked The Mecklenburg County Board Of Elections To Investigate Whether Harrigan Was Fraudulently Registered To Vote In The County. </strong>According to The Charlotte Observer, “Democratic congressional nominee Jeff Jackson on Thursday asked the Mecklenburg County Board of Elections to investigate whether his Republican opponent Pat Harrigan is fraudulently registered to vote in Mecklenburg County.” [Charlotte Observer, <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article266911781.html#storylink=cpy"><u>10/6/22</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Jackson Claimed That Harrigan Registered To Vote In Mecklenburg County And Voted Twice Despite It Not Being His Permanent Residence. </strong>According to The Charlotte Observer, “In a letter to the Mecklenburg Board of Elections, Jackson claimed Harrigan registered to vote in Mecklenburg County and voted twice despite it not being his permanent residence. Harrigan has a home in Catawba County, which is outside of the district where he’s running.” [Charlotte Observer, <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article266911781.html#storylink=cpy"><u>10/6/22</u></a>]&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Jackson Asked The Board Of Elections To Investigate Whether Harrigan Improperly Voted And Registered To Vote In A County Where He Doesn’t Permanently Reside. </strong>According to The Charlotte Observer, “Candidates are allowed to run for congressional districts where they don’t live. Jackson argues in his letter, though, that the Board of Elections should investigate whether Harrigan improperly voted and registered to vote in a county where he doesn’t permanently reside.” [Charlotte Observer, <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article266911781.html#storylink=cpy"><u>10/6/22</u></a>]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Harrigan’s Advisor Said The Complaint Was “A Bogus Distraction From A Radical Leftist Lawyer Who Is Closer In The Polls Than He Wants To Be, And Is Desperately Trying To Change The Subject From His Disastrous Inflation-Causing Policies.” </strong>According to The Charlotte Observer, “Jordan Shaw, Harrigan’s advisor, said in a statement to the Observer Jackson’s complaint is ‘a bogus distraction from a radical leftist lawyer who is closer in the polls than he wants to be, and is desperately trying to change the subject from his disastrous inflation-causing policies.’” [Charlotte Observer, <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article266911781.html#storylink=cpy"><u>10/6/22</u></a>]</p>
<h3><strong>2022: Harrigan Refused To Send A Financial Disclosure Form To The U.S. House Committee On Ethics</strong></h3>
<p><strong>2022: Harrigan Refused To Send A Financial Disclosure Form To The U.S. House Committee On Ethics. </strong>According to The News &amp; Observer, “Four candidates running for Congress in North Carolina failed to submit required documents to the House ethics committee that would give constituents a better idea of their finances and what could influence the decisions they make in Congress. Those candidates include Charles Graham, Scott Huffman, Tyler Lee and Pat Harrigan. None of them sent in a financial disclosure form to the U.S. House Committee on Ethics.” [News &amp; Observer, <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article267512253.html"><u>10/19/22</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Harrigan Declined To Comment On The Missing Report. </strong>According to The News &amp; Observer, “McClatchy contacted each of the four campaigns. Graham's team said it was looking into the situation. None of the rest provided comment.” [News &amp; Observer, <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article267512253.html"><u>10/19/22</u></a>]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A North Carolina Campaign Finance And Ethics Lawyer Said That “The Problem With Candidates Failing To File These Financial Disclosure Forms Is That They Are Asking The Voters To Make A Decision Without All The Information They Are Entitled To Have.” </strong>According to The News &amp; Observer, “‘The problem with candidates failing to file these financial disclosure forms is that they are asking the voters to make a decision without all the information they are entitled to have,’ said Brett Kappel, an attorney focused on campaign finance, lobbying and government ethics laws.” [News &amp; Observer, <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article267512253.html"><u>10/19/22</u></a>]</p>
