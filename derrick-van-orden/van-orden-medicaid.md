## Overview

Van Orden promised that he could not cut Medicaid and that Americans would not see [“a single nickel reduction”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8LISRGHpcs&list=PLWuvMonaruUimi7u8uNYdlKyfYpbR1AHu&index=8) in their benefits. Then, he [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that would kick [17 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including nearly [12 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off of Medicaid. More than [32,000 Wisconsinites](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) could lose their health coverage as a result of his votes. Van Orden also put [rural hospitals](https://www.wpr.org/news/rural-hospitals-midwest-medicaid-changes) like [MCHS Oakridge](https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_on_rural_hospitals.pdf) [at risk](https://upnorthnewswi.com/2025/08/08/rural-health-care-death-spiral-gop-medicaid-cuts/). 

## 2025: After Promising To Protect Rural Health Care, Van Orden Voted To Kick Nearly 12 Million Americans Off Their Health Insurance

### Van Orden Claimed Americans Would Not See “A Single Nickel Reduction” in Their Medicaid Benefits as A Result of Republicans’ Actions in Congress

**Van Orden Claimed Americans Who Relied On Medicare, Medicaid, WIC, SNAP Or Veterans’ Benefits Would Not See “A Single Nickel Reduction” In Their Benefits.** According to a Facebook Town Hall hosted by Rep. Derrick Van Orden, “VAN ORDEN: Last Congress, there was a group of people on the left saying that Republicans were going to cut Medicaid, said we were going to cut Medicare, said we're going to cut Social Security. They said we're going to cut SNAP. They said we're going to cut WIC. They said we're going to cut veterans benefits. And none of that came true. And the same people that lied to you about Republicans cutting Medicaid, Medicare, SNAP, WIC, veterans benefits, they are the same people that are telling you the same lies now. And for me personally, I find it despicable when people are fear mongering with those most vulnerable: our veterans, our seniors, and hungry children. So there is nothing in the continuing resolution at all that cuts any of these programs. So if you are an American citizen and you're legally accessing any of these programs, SNAP, WIC, veterans’ benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, you're not going to see a single nickel reduction in your benefits, period. And anybody that's telling you anything else is lying to you.” \[Facebook, Rep. Derrick Van Orden, [3/12/25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8LISRGHpcs)\] (video) 

-   **Van Orden Claimed Anyone Who Said The House Republicans’ Reconciliation Bill Would Include Cuts To Medicaid Was A Liar.** According to a Facebook Town Hall hosted by Rep. Derrick Van Orden, “VAN ORDEN: The budget resolution that was passed and everybody was calling saying you're cutting Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. That's not true. There's no specific programs listed in the budget resolution, zero. So when we get 400 phone calls and people are literally reading off a script, to me, that's not a spontaneous uprising. What that is, is a centralized group of people that are muckraking, sending out a script for people to read. And when you do that, you clog the phones and I can't hear an actual issue. So when there's nothing listed and there isn't, it's a public record. And if you want, we'll post the link to the budget resolution. There is no specific programs listed at all. So if people have been telling you that, and I know a lot of people on the left have been telling you there were specific things listed to cut in the budget resolution, Its not true, which means they've been lying to you. So one more time, there was no specific programs listed in the budget resolution at all. And that's not even a budget. A budget resolution allows the committees to look into the individual budgets to make sure that we can maximize all of the dollars. So if anybody told you anything other than that, again, they're lying to you.” \[Facebook, Rep. Derrick Van Orden, [3/12/25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_QWl3hf_UA)\] (video)

**Van Orden: “We Are Not Cutting Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, WIC, SNAP Benefits, Or Veterans’ Benefits. And Anybody That Tells You We Are, They’re The Same People That Told You Two Years We’re Doing That And They Lied To You And They’re Lying To You Again."** According to an interview Derrick Van Orden gave on the Vicki McKenna show, "VAN ORDEN: I want to say one last thing. We are not cutting Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, WIC, SNAP benefits, or veterans’ benefits. And anybody that tells you we are, they’re the same people that told you two years we’re doing that and they lied to you and they’re lying to you again." \[The Vicki McKenna Show, [3/25/25](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/derrick-van-orden-the-vicki-mckenna-show-32525/s-yJywpTQxMSo?si=a6030d2f190e44ef849bb8f24427cbf0&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)\] (audio) 

**2/25/25: Van Orden Promised That Medicaid And Social Security Would Not Be Affected By House Republicans’ Reconciliation Bill.** According to an interview Derrick Van Orden did on the John Fredericks show, “VAN ORDEN: Well, let's make sure we understand what we're talking about so that in order, how Congress works, the rules that are set, we have to do a budget resolution that comes through the Budget Committee, chaired by Jody Arrington, who's a friend of mine, great dude, Texas guy. And what that does is it sets parameters like the Ag committee is supposed to get X amount of money, the Department of Defense is going to gain X percentage of cash. We're voting on that today. And there is not a single individual program that's listed in that budget resolution. And so all this stuff you're hearing from the Democrats, all the attack ads, everything this is going to sound shocking, is a lie. So there's not, you're going to cut this Medicaid thing or any of that stuff. Medicaid is not getting affected. Social Security's not getting affected. Right? But there's no individual programs listed in that budget resolution. This just sets targets.” \[John Fredericks Show, [2/25/25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkLCQ9iRnb4)\] (video) 

#### Van Orden Promised He Would Not Vote For A Bill That Cut Rural Health Care

**Van Orden: “I've Been Crystal Clear With The Leadership In The House Here. If During This Budget Reconciliation Process They're Going To Try To Cut Rural Health Care, I Am Not On Board.”** According to a Facebook Town Hall hosted by Rep. Derrick Van Orden, “VAN ORDEN: So just because we live in rural areas doesn't mean that high quality health care should be rarely accessible to us. I have very, very few hard lines when it comes to these issues that we talk about regularly. One of them is this. That I've been crystal clear with the leadership in the House here. If during this budget reconciliation process they're going to try to cut rural health care, I am not on board. I will not be on board with a package that does, that if anybody is trying to cut any type of rural health care, it's just not going to happen on my watch.” \[Facebook, Rep. Derrick Van Orden, [3/12/25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA5Za19RS90)\] (video) 

-   **Van Orden: “What I Care About Is Making Sure That My Constituents And The Other People In Rural Wisconsin And All Across Rural America Have Access To Clean Drinking Water, Have Access To Public Safety, Have Access To Meaningful, Reliable Power And Medical Care.”** According to a Facebook Town Hall hosted by Rep. Derrick Van Orden, “VAN ORDEN: So, what I'm doing here every day and I know it’s, the reason you don't see this stuff on TV or read about in the paper is because people it's just not, you know, it's not sexy to people. Well, I don't care about that. What I care about is making sure that my constituents and the other people in rural Wisconsin and all across rural America have access to clean drinking water, have access to public safety, have access to meaningful, reliable power and medical care. Those are the issues that we work on every single day tirelessly here in Washington, D.C.” \[Facebook, Rep. Derrick Van Orden, [3/12/25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDnTulk2Kxo)\] (video)

### July 2025: Van Orden Voted for The Final Version of Republicans’ Reconciliation Bill

**July 2025: Van Orden Celebrated Voting For The Final Republican Budget Bill, Claiming It Was A “Once-In-A-Lifetime Opportunity For Americans.”** According to a press release from Rep. Derrick Van Orden, "Today, Congressman Derrick Van Orden (WI-03) released the following statement after voting to pass H.R.1 – the One, Big, Beautiful Bill: ‘This bill is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Americans – our seniors, veterans, families, farmers, manufacturers, and most vulnerable populations. ‘My Democrat colleagues have been fearmongering and pushing blatant lies from day one, and that ends now. When this beautiful bill reaches President Trump’s desk, Americans will see their taxes go down, wages go up, and integrity and stability restored in critical programs like SNAP and Medicaid. ‘This is what delivering real results for the people I represent looks like and what 77 million Americans and 1.7 Wisconsinites voted for.’" \[Press Release – Rep. Derrick Van Orden, 7/3/25; H.R. 1, House Vote 190, [7/3/25](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2025190)\]

-   **The Congressional Budget Office Estimated That 11.8 Million People Would Become Uninsured As A Result Of The Medicaid Cuts In Republicans’ Reconciliation Bill.** According to the Washington Post, "The bill, which narrowly passed the Senate on Tuesday and now heads back to the House, would effectively accomplish what Republicans have long failed to do: unwind many of the key components of the ACA, President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement, which dramatically increased the number of Americans with access to health insurance. To start, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Senate version of the bill would result in 11.8 million more uninsured in 2034, mostly because of Medicaid cuts, compared with 10.9 million if the House version became law." \[Washington Post, [7/1/25](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/)\]

### May 2025: Van Orden Voted for House Republicans’ Budget Bill, Which Would Kick Millions of People Off Medicaid and Snap to Give Tax Breaks to Billionaires 

**2025: Van Orden Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Included $3.8 Trillion In Tax Cuts Offset By $1.5 Trillion In Spending Reductions To Programs Like Medicaid And The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.** In May 2025, Van Orden voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would provide for approximately $3.8 trillion in net tax cuts and $321 billion in military, border enforcement and judiciary spending, offset by $1.5 trillion in spending reductions, as instructed in the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). It would raise the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion and provide for increased spending on defense and border security, spending cuts on social safety net programs, such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It also includes a mix of tax breaks for businesses and individuals; tax increases on universities and foundations; and a phase-down of clean energy tax credits. \[…\] It would reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by requiring states to shoulder more of the cost, expand work requirements for SNAP, extend programs authorized under the 2018 farm bill, and prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Program. As amended, it would cap state and local tax deductions at $40,000 for households with incomes below $500,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 215 to 214. \[House Vote 145, [5/22/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [5/22/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/145?4); Congressional Actions, [H.R. 1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions)\]

-   **The House GOP Budget Bill Was Estimated To Increase The Uninsured Population By 8.6 Million By 2034.** According to CNN, “The Medicaid and Affordable Care Act provisions in the package could result in 8.6 million more people being uninsured in 2034, according to an early CBO estimate released by Democratic lawmakers. That number is expected to grow with the latest changes.” \[CNN, [5/28/25](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/what-is-in-trump-tax-spending-cuts-package)\]
-   **The House GOP Budget Bill SNAP Funding By $267 Billion.** According to CNN, “Funding for Medicaid would be slashed by nearly $700 billion, according to CBO, though that figure will likely grow even larger once CBO factors in changes made to the bill. The food stamps program would see a cut of $267 billion in federal support.” \[CNN, [5/28/25](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/what-is-in-trump-tax-spending-cuts-package)\]
-   **The House GOP Budget Bill Codified A Trump Administration Proposal That Restricted Access To The Affordable Care Act.** According to CNN, “The bill also calls for codifying a Trump administration proposal that would make changes to the Affordable Care Act enrollment process, including shortening the open enrollment period and eliminating the ability of low-income Americans to sign up year-round.” \[CNN, [5/28/25](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/what-is-in-trump-tax-spending-cuts-package)\]
-   **The House GOP Budget Bill Made The 2017 Income Tax Breaks Permanent And Added An Estimated $3.8 Trillion To The National Debt Over 10 Years.** According to CNN, “The package includes several controversial measures that would deeply cut into two of the nation’s key safety net programs – Medicaid and food stamps – while making permanent essentially all of the trillions of dollars of individual income tax breaks contained in the GOP’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. What’s more, it would fulfill Trump’s campaign promises to cut taxes on tips and overtime, albeit temporarily. The magnitude of the measures is evident in the estimates of the cost they would incur or the savings they would produce. \[…\] The tax changes in the package would add $3.8 trillion to the nation’s debt over a decade, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis released before last-minute changes were made to the bill.” \[CNN, [5/28/25](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/what-is-in-trump-tax-spending-cuts-package)\]

### February 2025: Van Orden Voted for A Budget Resolution That Spelled Out Future Medicaid Cuts But Claimed It Didn’t

**February 2025: Van Orden Voted In Favor Of The House Republican Budget Resolution.** According to a press release from Rep. Derrick Van Orden, "Today, Congressman Derrick Van Orden (WI-03) released the following statement after voting to pass the House Budget Resolution: ‘To be explicitly clear: today’s budget resolution did not include any cuts to specific programs. Anyone saying otherwise is lying and engaging in the fearmongering of our farmers, veterans, seniors, and most vulnerable populations. The budget resolution simply sets the framework for how the federal government can be better stewards of taxpayer dollars. ‘Millions of Americans depend on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and I will have no part in cutting these programs for the folks that are legally entitled to them.’" \[Press Release – Rep. Derrick Van Orden, [2/25/25](https://vanorden.house.gov/media/press-releases/van-orden-statement-house-budget-resolution)\]

-   **HEADLINE: “What Can House Republicans Cut Instead Of Medicaid? Not Much.”** \[New York Times, [2/25/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/upshot/republicans-medicaid-house-budget.html)\]
-   **HEADLINE: "House Republican Budget Takes Away Health Care, Food Aid To Pay For Expanded Tax Cuts For Wealthy"** \[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, [2/21/25](https://www.cbpp.org/blog/house-republican-budget-takes-away-health-care-food-aid-to-pay-for-expanded-tax-cuts-for)\]
-   **New York Times Reported The $880 Billion In Cuts Required By The Republican Budget Proposal Would Have To Come From Medicaid, Medicare, Or CHIP.** According to the New York Times, "The budget resolution itself is silent on whether Congress cuts Medicaid, which provides health coverage to 72 million poor and disabled Americans. But it instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the program, to cut spending by $880 billion over the next decade. If the committee can’t save at least that much, the entire effort could be imperiled because of the special process Congress is using to avoid a Senate filibuster. Ten other committees have their own instructions to follow, though none have been assigned with cutting nearly as much.  It’s not so simple as finding the cuts elsewhere. The special process, known as budget reconciliation, means Republicans will have to find all $880 billion from within the Energy and Commerce Committee’s jurisdiction. That leaves them with fewer options than one might think. \[…\] If Republicans want to avoid major cuts to Medicaid, the largest pot of available money is in the other big government health insurance program: Medicare. \[…\] Even if the committee cuts everything that’s not health care to $0, it will still be more than $600 billion short.  The committee could also save around $200 billion by eliminating the Children’s Health Insurance Program, but that option has not been raised by the budget committee or anyone in House leadership. \[…\] Even if all of these cuts, revenues and rule cancellations from outside health care can pass muster, the committee will still be left with hundreds of billions of dollars to cut to hit its goal. Mathematically, the budget committee’s instructions mean the committee would need to make major cuts to either Medicare, Medicaid or both." \[New York Times, [2/25/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/upshot/republicans-medicaid-house-budget.html)\]
