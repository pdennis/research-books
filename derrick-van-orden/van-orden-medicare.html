<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Van Orden claimed Americans would not see a “single nickel reduction” in their Medicare benefits as a result of Republicans' budget bill. Then, he <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml">voted</a> for a bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would result in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/">nearly $500 billion</a> in cuts to Medicare, absent future congressional action.</p>
<h2>Van Orden Voted For Massive Cuts To Medicare After Promising He Wouldn’t</h2>
<h3>2025: Van Orden Voted For House Republicans’ Reconciliation Bill, Which Would Trigger Nearly $500 Billion in Medicare Cuts</h3>
<p><strong>2025: Van Orden Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Included $3.8 Trillion In Tax Cuts Offset By $1.5 Trillion In Spending Reductions To Programs Like Medicaid And The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</strong> In May 2025, Van Orden voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would provide for approximately $3.8 trillion in net tax cuts and $321 billion in military, border enforcement and judiciary spending, offset by $1.5 trillion in spending reductions, as instructed in the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). It would raise the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion and provide for increased spending on defense and border security, spending cuts on social safety net programs, such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It also includes a mix of tax breaks for businesses and individuals; tax increases on universities and foundations; and a phase-down of clean energy tax credits. […] It would reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by requiring states to shoulder more of the cost, expand work requirements for SNAP, extend programs authorized under the 2018 farm bill, and prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Program. As amended, it would cap state and local tax deductions at $40,000 for households with incomes below $500,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 215 to 214.

  <li><strong>Congressional Budget Office Estimated That The House Republican Reconciliation Bill Would Trigger Nearly $500 Billion In Cuts To Medicare.</strong>&nbsp;According to a letter the Congressional Budget Office sent to Rep. Brendan Boyle, "Today the Congressional Budget Office transmitted an estimate of the budgetary effects of the 2025 reconciliation bill, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Budget on May 18, 2025. 1 CBO has not yet completed estimates of the effects of interactions among the titles of the legislation. This letter responds to your questions concerning the sequestration (the cancellation of budgetary resources) in accordance with the Statutory Pay‑As‑You‑Go Act of 2010 (S-PAYGO) that would occur if an enacted bill raised deficits by $2.3 trillion over 10 years. Under S-PAYGO, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is required to maintain 5- and 10-year scorecards that it updates with the estimated cumulative changes in revenues and outlays generated by newly enacted legislation. […] The 4 percent maximum reduction in Medicare spending would apply to sequestration orders for years after 2026. If OMB ordered a sequestration of $230 billion for each year through 2034, the ordered reductions in Medicare spending would increase to about $75 billion in 2034 and would total roughly $490 billion over the 2027–2034 period."

<p><strong>July 2025: Van Orden Voted For The Senate FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Extended $4 Trillion In Expiring Tax Cuts, Added New Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025, Van Orden voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, the “motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214.

<h3>Van Orden Claimed Americans Would Not See “A Single Nickel Reduction” In Their Medicare Benefits As A Result of Republicans’ Actions In Congress</h3>
<p><strong>Van Orden Claimed Americans Who Relied On Medicare, Medicaid, WIC, SNAP Or Veterans’ Benefits Would Not See “A Single Nickel Reduction” In Their Benefits.</strong>&nbsp;According to a Facebook Town Hall hosted by Rep. Derrick Van Orden, “VAN ORDEN: Last Congress, there was a group of people on the left saying that Republicans were going to cut Medicaid, said we were going to cut Medicare, said we're going to cut Social Security. They said we're going to cut SNAP. They said we're going to cut WIC. They said we're going to cut veterans benefits. And none of that came true. And the same people that lied to you about Republicans cutting Medicaid, Medicare, SNAP, WIC, veterans benefits, they are the same people that are telling you the same lies now. And for me personally, I find it despicable when people are fear mongering with those most vulnerable: our veterans, our seniors, and hungry children. So there is nothing in the continuing resolution at all that cuts any of these programs. So if you are an American citizen and you're legally accessing any of these programs, SNAP, WIC, veterans’ benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, you're not going to see a single nickel reduction in your benefits, period. And anybody that's telling you anything else is lying to you.” [Facebook, Rep. Derrick Van Orden, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzuAI8bVis">3/12/25</a>] (video)</p>

  <li><strong>Van Orden Claimed Anyone Who Said The House Republicans’ Reconciliation Bill Would Include Cuts To Medicaid Was A Liar.</strong>&nbsp;According to a Facebook Town Hall hosted by Rep. Derrick Van Orden, “VAN ORDEN: The budget resolution that was passed and everybody was calling saying you're cutting Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. That's not true. There's no specific programs listed in the budget resolution, zero. So when we get 400 phone calls and people are literally reading off a script, to me, that's not a spontaneous uprising. What that is, is a centralized group of people that are muckraking, sending out a script for people to read. And when you do that, you clog the phones and I can't hear an actual issue. So when there's nothing listed and there isn't, it's a public record. And if you want, we'll post the link to the budget resolution. There is no specific programs listed at all. So if people have been telling you that, and I know a lot of people on the left have been telling you there were specific things listed to cut in the budget resolution, Its not true, which means they've been lying to you. So one more time, there was no specific programs listed in the budget resolution at all. And that's not even a budget. A budget resolution allows the committees to look into the individual budgets to make sure that we can maximize all of the dollars. So if anybody told you anything other than that, again, they're lying to you.” [Facebook, Rep. Derrick Van Orden, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_QWl3hf_UA">3/12/25</a>] (video)</li>
