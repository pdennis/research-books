## Overview

Despite acknowledging that tariffs were “going to be painful” for Wisconsinites, Van Orden not only [defended](https://www.wizmnews.com/2025/05/22/rep-van-orden-speaks-on-snap-vote-and-how-farmers-could-benefit-from-tariffs/) the tariffs, but threatened other countries and told them to get in line with the [trade war](https://wisconsinagconnection.com/news/wisconsin-soybean-farmers-hit-hard-by-new-us-tariffs?utm_source=chatgpt.com) or Trump would destroy them. He even [taunted](https://www.wispolitics.com/2025/baldwin-calls-trump-tariffs-bad-news-while-gop-house-members-express-support/) a Canadian premier after he announced retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. 

Then, he voted four times to protect the tariffs, including in April 2025 when he was the [deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect them, dooming Wisconsin families who relied on him to a trade war and rising prices. Tariffs are contributing to [higher food prices](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi) and [causing](https://barnraisingmedia.com/farmer-cost-of-trump-tariffs-wisconsin/) [problems](https://www.wisn.com/article/a-whole-lot-of-uncertainty-tariffs-take-a-toll-on-wisconsin-farmers/64425479) for Wisconsin farmers. 

As a result of Trump’s trade war, China has [stopped buying Americans soybeans](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/business/china-us-soybeans-farming.html) and instead [started buying them from Brazil](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-misses-out-billions-dollars-china-soybean-sales-midway-through-peak-season-2025-09-10/). China has previously been the [biggest buyer](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/the-american-farmers-china-is-using-as-a-trade-war-bargaining-chip-134c2cda?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAim6K_ctW7ArWM9H6fc_WMa3BuzkmnO1jk_Gc3V0CbMeWyyd1kdeiVJGKHZ73M%3D&gaa_ts=68cc4400&gaa_sig=a7zuiQ_nXRNWx5AM9EsmgKrpRrZEa7Quu2sP9yd5RR5WSyKuJld_wSYsuOip6gkZwbwixDT4bJjsGn-_hMlecQ%3D%3D) of American soybeans.

## Van Orden Defended Trump’s Tariffs, Which Were Causing Higher Costs And Uncertainty For Wisconsin Farmers

### Van Orden Defended Trump’s Tariffs

**Van Orden Said He Supported A Trade War Until American Manufacturers And Farmers Were Shown Respect.** According to an interview with Derrick Van Orden on WSAW (CBS), “VAN ORDEN: We don't want to have a trade war with Canada, Mexico, or the EU, but we will have one if they don't start showing our American manufacturers respect, and showing our farmers respect. We're not gonna tolerate this anymore.” \[WSAW (CBS), [5/2/25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcAAqy978Xo)\] (video)

-   **Van Orden Met With Business Leaders At The La Crosse Chamber And Said He Understood The Uncertainty Businesses Were Feeling But Claimed Republicans Were Trying To Create A Leveled Playing Field For Manufacturers And Farmers.** According to WXOW, "Representative Derrick Van Orden made a stop in the Coulee Region Wednesday, meeting with La Crosse business owners and the La Crosse Chamber. 20 business and educational leaders met at Mid-City Steel to share their concerns about the uncertainty in the economy and how it is affecting their businesses.  Everything from healthcare to higher education and tariffs was discussed.  Van Orden said he hears and understands their concerns.  ‘The big elephant in the room is what is going on right now at the federal level,’ he said. ‘And there's a lot of uncertainty for businesses. I encourage everybody—it's been less than 100 days. There is a plan in place in order to get a level playing field for our manufacturers and farmers and everybody here. When America has a level playing field, we will dominate any industry. So, that's what is taking place. There is uncertainty right now and I understand it completely.’" \[WXOW (ABC), [4/23/25](https://www.wxow.com/news/politics/rep-van-orden-talks-with-la-crosse-business-owners-about-economy/article_75968558-eb53-4d59-9ef3-c81b8ffc8549.html)\]
-   **Van Orden Defended Trump’s Tariffs On Foreign Trade And Suggested Things Were Going To Turn Out Good For Farmers Because They Will Be “Respected” As A Result Of Trump’s Deals.** According to WIZM News, According to WIZM News, "The Congressman also says area farmers will benefit from tariffs on foreign trade being enacted by the Trump White House.  ‘Things are gonna turn out good, and they are,’ said Van Orden. He mentions a new trade deal with the UK. ‘You know what that’s for? Ag,’ he said.  Van Orden says farmers in his district will be ‘respected’ as a result of realignments in American trade policies. He believes that if people relax and see beyond the arguments, they will see benefits of the trade deals." \[WIZM News, [5/22/25](https://www.wizmnews.com/2025/05/22/rep-van-orden-speaks-on-snap-vote-and-how-farmers-could-benefit-from-tariffs/)\]

### Van Orden Admitted Local Businesses Would Be Affected by Tariffs

**While Talking To Workers At A Manufacturing Facility In Eau Claire, Van Orden Said In A Perfect World There Would Be No Impact From Tariffs On Local Businesses.** According to the Leader-Telegram, "International tariffs were a big talking point for Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Prairie du Chien) during a visit to an Eau Claire manufacturing facility on Friday.  J&D Manufacturing, the Eau Claire-based business which primarily manufactures industrial fans for use in the agriculture industry, has business that extends beyond the Chippewa Valley to international customers. That is the case for many other businesses that operate out of the third congressional district, as Van Orden said it is his job to go speak to his constituents and bring their concerns to Washington D.C. in an effort to try to work out legislative solutions. \[…\] When asked about tariff impacts on local businesses, Van Orden said, ‘In a perfect world, they would have no impact. What we are trying to do is rearrange the entire global trade network, and it is an incredibly complicated thing.’ Continuing, he said that with the 90-day tariff hold, 77 countries have come directly to the United States to do bilateral trade agreements. Van Orden said the federal government does not want a trade war, but rather wants a level playing field and respect for manufacturers and farmers." \[Leader-Telegram, [5/4/25](https://www.leadertelegram.com/news/local/rep-van-orden-visits-local-manufacturer-amid-international-tariff-discussions/article_749b2af4-515b-402e-b829-d011853ef076.html)\]

**Van Orden Defended Trump’s Tariffs Despite Admitting They Were “Going To Be Painful.”** According to an interview Rep. Derrick Van Orden gave on NewsNation, “HOST: On a different kind of international affairs. President Trump is touting billions of dollars in tariff revenue flowing into federal coffers as his latest round of import taxes take effect. Since imposing an initial round of 10% baseline tariffs on most goods in April, the Treasury has collected more than $100 billion in revenue. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says it could be more than $300 billion in all this year. That's a big bite out of the economy. Some in your party suggested tariff rebates to soften the blow. Others want to use the money to cool down our red hot deficit. What do you think should become of that money? VAN ORDEN: Well, first and foremost, I think the American industries that have been affected by this horrible trade environment set by the Biden administration need to be made whole. So if our farmers are hurting because we can't export stuff, if our manufacturers are hurting because we can't import stuff, they need to be compensated from these tariffs. These money should be going to American industries to make sure that they remain vital throughout this really difficult time. We've got to understand President Trump is in the process of reordering the entire global trade system, and that's going to be painful. And I understand that. And there's a lot of angst going out with our American companies. But here's what the folks around the world need to understand. Donald Trump is the most American first president in the history of our country, maybe besides George Washington, because he made America. And if President Trump is willing to have it be very uncomfortable for some of our folks here in the United States, imagine what he's going to do to you.” \[NewsNation, The Hill, [8/10/25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaMf-PCm77c)\] (video) 

#### Van Orden’s Advice To Wisconsin Farmers Dealing With Trump’s Tariffs Was To “Take A Knee And Hydrate” And “Just Hold On”

**Van Orden To Farmers On Trump’s Tariffs: “Just Again, Take A Knee And Hydrate. Just Hold On. Do Not Make Long Term Business Decisions Over A Short Term Consequence, Meaning Let's Let These Play Out.”** According to a virtual town hall hosted by Rep. Derrick Van Orden, “HOST: In a similar subject. Verlyn asks from Clover asks, what is the best way for Wisconsin farmers to capitalize on the tariffs? VAN ORDEN: Well, first and foremost, Clover is awesome. I mean, it's just fantastic. I love Clover. How do you capitalize on it right now? Just again, take a knee and hydrate. Just hold on. Do not make long term business decisions over a short term consequence, meaning let's let these play out. Be postured to produce your agricultural products to export. But don't start saying, oh, my goodness, you know, we're going to have a larger market for beans. So instead of corn to put being in the ground. No, don't do that . Just wait. Do what you're doing before. We will find markets for your products.” \[Rep. Derrick Van Orden Virtual Town Hall, [5/22/25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_-nQ9J-4bw)\] (video) 

### Van Orden Threatened Other Countries and Told Them to Get in Line with Trump’s Trade War or Trump Would Destroy Them

**Van Orden On Trump’s Tariffs: “We Don't Want A Trade War With Anybody. You Better Get On Board. You Better Set A Level Playing Field For Our American Manufacturers And Our Farmers, Or We're Going To Destroy You. Utterly.”** According to an interview Rep. Derrick Van Orden gave on NewsNation, “VAN ORDEN: Well, first and foremost, I think the American industries that have been affected by this horrible trade environment set by the Biden administration need to be made whole. So if our farmers are hurting because we can't export stuff, if our manufacturers are hurting because we can't import stuff, they need to be compensated from these tariffs. These money should be going to American industries to make sure that they remain vital throughout this really difficult time. We've got to understand President Trump is in the process of reordering the entire global trade system, and that's going to be painful. And I understand that. And there's a lot of angst going out with our American companies. But here's what the folks around the world need to understand. Donald Trump is the most American first president in the history of our country, maybe besides George Washington, because he made America. And if President Trump is willing to have it be very uncomfortable for some of our folks here in the United States, imagine what he's going to do to you. So I'm encouraging all of our partners around the world. We don't want a trade war with anybody. You better get on board. You better set a level playing field for our American manufacturers and our farmers, or we're going to destroy you. Utterly.” \[NewsNation, The Hill, [8/10/25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaMf-PCm77c)\] (video) 

#### Van Orden Taunted Canada After One Of Its Officials Announced Retaliatory Tariffs On The United States

**Van Orden Told The Ontario Premier To “Kick Rocks” After He Announced Retaliatory Actions To Trump’s Tariffs.** According to WisPolitics, "Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Prairie du Chien, blasted Ontario Premier Doug Ford in a post on X for banning American companies from contracts with the province, telling him Wisconsin’s maple syrup ‘kicks the sh\*t out of yours.’   ‘Not to mention our cheese, butter, milk, sausage, cranberries, corn, potatoes, carrots, bovine genetics, mink pelts, and real football. That is just Wisconsin. Get your mind right or Kick Rocks, Tubby,’ Van Orden wrote." \[WisPolitics, [2/4/25](https://www.wispolitics.com/2025/baldwin-calls-trump-tariffs-bad-news-while-gop-house-members-express-support/)\]

-   **HEADLINE: “Ontario Premier 'Ripping Up Contract' With Musk's Starlink In Response To Tariffs”** \[ABC News, [2/3/25](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/ontario-premier-ripping-contract-musks-starlink-response-trump-118394700)\]

### Van Orden Repeatedly Voted to Protect Trump’s Tariffs

#### September 2025: Van Orden Voted To Protect Trump’s Tariffs

**2025: Van Orden Effectively Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through March 2026.** In September 2025, Van Orden voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the resolution \[that\] would allow for the tolling (the pausing of counting) of days for resolutions of inquiry from Sept. 30, 2025 through March 31, 2026. It also would provide that each day during the period from April 9, 2025, through March 31, 2026. would not constitute a calendar day for the purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution to terminate President Donald Trump's April 2, 2025 executive order declaring a national emergency regarding tariffs on imported goods. The resolution also would provide that during the period for March 11, 2025 through March 31, 2026, would not constitute a calendar day for purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution terminating a national emergency executive order declared by President Trump on Feb. 1, 2025. Such an executive order concerned tariffs on many Canadian and Mexican imports and Chinese goods. The resolution also would provide that the provisions of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act would not apply through March 31, 2026 to a joint resolution terminating the national emergency.” The vote was on the rule. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 213 to 211. \[House Vote 268, [9/16/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll268.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [9/16/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/268?4); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 707](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/707/all-actions);Congressional Actions, [H.Con. Res. 14](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/14/all-actions)\]

-   **Support Was Won From GOP Holdouts Through A Promise Of A Vote Later In The Week To Shorten The Block To End In January Rather Than March.** According to Politico, “GOP leaders flipped several of the Republican holdouts with a promise to add language shortening the block on tariff disapproval votes to a forthcoming measure set for approval later in the week, per two Republicans with direct knowledge of the agreement. The expiration date on the block will be reset from March 31 to the end of January, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Tuesday. It’s likely the Supreme Court will have ruled on a challenge to Trump’s tariff-declaring powers by then.” \[Politico, [9/16/25](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/16/congress/house-again-votes-to-surrender-tariff-powers-to-trump-00566975)\]

#### April 2025: Van Orden Was The Deciding Vote To Protect Trump’s Tariffs

**2025: Van Orden Cast The Deciding Vote For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through September 2025.** In April 2025, Van Orden voted for, “adoption of the rule (H Res 313) that would provide for floor consideration of the Senate amendment to the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). The rule would provide up to one hour of debate on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the measure. It also would block the expedited consideration of joint resolutions terminating President Donald Trump’s tariff actions under the April 2 executive order by providing that each day during the period from April 9, 2025 through Sept. 30, 2025, will not constitute a calendar day under the federal law pertaining to terminating national emergencies.” The vote was on the rule. The underlying legislation was the FY 2025 budget resolution. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 216 to 215. \[House Vote 94, [4/9/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/9/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/94?4); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 313](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/313/all-actions);Congressional Actions, [H.Con. Res. 14](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/14/all-actions)\]

-   **Speaker Johnson Backed The Move, Claiming Trump Has “Executive Authority” And That The Tariffs Are “In The Interest Of The American People.”** According to ABC News, “House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., defended the move, telling reporters, ‘I've made it very clear I think the president has executive authority. It's an appropriate level of authority to deal with the unfair trade practices. That's part of the role of the president is to negotiate with other countries.’ Johnson said Trump told him Tuesday night that ‘there are almost 70 countries that are \[in\] some stage in negotiation of more fair-trade agreement agreements with the United States. I think that is in the interest of the American people. I think that is an ‘America First’ policy that will be effective, and so we have to give them the space to do it.’” \[ABC News, [4/9/25](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-gop-moves-prevent-votes-rescinding-trump-tariffs/story?id=120644968)\]
-   **The Vote Was The Second Use Of The Procedural Tactic To Block Votes On The Tariffs, The First Use Of It Being In March.** According to ABC News, “House Democrats, led by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., moved to force a vote on Tuesday on terminating the national emergency authority and blocking Trump's sweeping tariffs. Now, that vote is unlikely to occur. This is the second time Johnson has moved to stop the legislative calendar to prevent votes on Trump's authority on tariffs. Under House rules, these votes would typically come up within 15 calendar days but now will not if the ‘rule’ passes during the vote series Wednesday afternoon.” \[ABC News, [4/9/25](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-gop-moves-prevent-votes-rescinding-trump-tariffs/story?id=120644968)\]

#### April 2025: Van Orden Voted To Protect Trump’s Tariffs

**2025: Van Orden Effectively Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through September 2025.** In April 2025, Van Orden voted for, “motion to order the previous question (thus ending debate and possibility of amendment) on the rule (H Res 313) that would providing for floor consideration of the Senate amendment to the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). The rule would provide up to one hour of debate on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the measure. It also would block the expedited consideration of joint resolutions terminating President Donald Trump’s tariff actions under the April 2 executive order by providing that each day during the period from April 9, 2025 through Sept. 30, 2025, will not constitute a calendar day under the federal law pertaining to terminating national emergencies.” The vote was on the previous question. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 217 to 212. \[House Vote 93, [4/9/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll093.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [4/9/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/93?4); Congressional Actions, [H.Res. 313](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/313/all-actions)\]

#### March 2025: Van Orden Voted To Protect Trump’s Tariffs

**2025: Van Orden Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs.** In March 2025, Van Orden voted for, “the bill that would provide for Congressional disapproval of, and nullify, a December 2024 IRS rule related to gross proceeds reporting by brokers involved in digital asset sales. The rule imposed reporting requirements, beginning in 2027, on non-custodial barkers who participate in the decentralized digital asset market. It also required brokers to file information returns and provide payee statements reporting gross proceeds from certain digital asset sales and transactions.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 292 to 132. \[House Vote 71, [3/11/25](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll071.xml); Congressional Quarterly, [3/11/25](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/71?4); Congressional Actions, [H.J. Res. 25](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-joint-resolution/25/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Effectively Blocked The House From Voting To Reverse Trump’s Tariffs On Mexico, Canada, And China For The Next Year.** According to the New York Times, “Republican leaders on Tuesday slipped language into a procedural measure that would prevent any resolution to end the tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China from receiving a vote this year. It passed on party lines as part of a resolution that cleared the way for a vote later Tuesday on a government spending bill needed to prevent a shutdown at the end of the week.” \[New York Times, [3/11/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]
-   **The Bill Nullified A Law That Would Allow The House And Senate To End A Disaster Declared By The President.** According to the New York Times, “In this case, Republican leaders did so using a particularly unusual contortion: They essentially declared the rest of the year one long day, nullifying a law that allows the House and Senate to jointly put an end to a disaster declared by the president.” \[New York Times, [3/11/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]
-   **The National Emergencies Act Required Consideration Of Resolutions Ending A Presidentially Declared Emergency Within Fifteen Calendar Days But Republican Leadership Included A Measure In The Bill Declaring The Rest Of The Year Did Not Constitute A Calendar Day.** According to the New York Times, “The national emergency law lays out a fast-track process for Congress to consider a resolution ending a presidential emergency, requiring committee consideration within 15 calendar days after one is introduced and a floor vote within three days after that. But the language House Republicans inserted in their measure on Tuesday declared that, ‘Each day for the remainder of the 119th Congress shall not constitute a calendar day’ for the purposes of the emergency that Mr. Trump declared on Feb. 1.” \[New York Times, [3/11/25](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html)\]

### Trump’s Tariffs Were Causing Higher Costs and Uncertainty for Wisconsin Farmers

**HEADLINE: "Tariffs, Trade War And Woes For Wisconsin's Soybean Farmers"** \[PBS Wisconsin, [10/2/25](https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/tariffs-trade-war-and-woes-for-wisconsins-soybean-farmers/)\]

**HEADLINE: "Tariff Wars Causing Uncertainties For Wisconsin Farmers"** \[WBAY, [3/19/25](https://www.wbay.com/2025/03/19/tariff-wars-causing-uncertainties-wisconsin-farmers/)\]

**Wisconsin Farmer: “Thanks To Trump, The Total Cost Of My Seed Treater Had Risen From $12,810 To $26,132.”** According to an opinion by a farmer in Wisconsin on Barn Raiser, "In response, on April 8, Trump announced he would raise tariffs on China to a total of 104% if China did not remove its tariffs, which China refused to do. Consequently, on April 9 (my birthday), thanks to Trump, the total cost of my seed treater had risen from $12,810 to $26,132. (Later that day, Trump announced he would pause the ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs for 90 days. At the same time he raised the cumulative tariff on China to 125%, while keeping in place the 10% universal tariff and the 25% tariff on both Mexico and Canada.) This kind of uncertainty and the skyrocketing costs associated with these tariffs means that it will take me an extra four years to pay for the treater, and, consequently, I will have less money to invest elsewhere in my business. Multiply this millions of times nationwide, and the result is trillions of dollars lost, with fewer jobs, products, goods and services for everyone in the country." \[Fourth Generation Wisconsin Farmer Mark Peck, Opinion – Barn Raiser, [4/10/25](https://barnraisingmedia.com/farmer-cost-of-trump-tariffs-wisconsin/)\]

**A Wisconsin Soybean Farmer Said The Uncertainty Brought By Tariffs Was Hard On His Farm And Expected His Products To Sell For Less Than What They Planned For.** According to WISN (ABC), "Local farmers are bracing for the impacts. Kevin Malchine is a sixth-generation farmer at Malchine Farms in Waterford.  ‘Our farm's been here since 1854,’ Malchine said.  His family's been farming in Racine County since before the tractor was invented. \[…\] ‘There's just a whole lot of uncertainty, maybe more uncertainty than I've ever seen in my lifetime,’ Malchine said.  He said the uncertainty is especially heightened during planting season. At his farm, they'll plant soybeans by the end of the month. Some of the crop will likely sell for less than what they planned for months ago. ‘We just don't know where it's going to end. That's probably the hardest thing that we're dealing with right now is that we just don't know,’ Malchine said." \[WISN (ABC), [4/8/25](https://www.wisn.com/article/a-whole-lot-of-uncertainty-tariffs-take-a-toll-on-wisconsin-farmers/64425479)\]

-   **The American Soybean Association Estimated A $5.9 Billion Annual Loss For The Soybean Industry Due To A Trade War.** According to WISN (ABC), "The American Soybean Association estimates a 60 percent tariff into China could result in a $5.9 billion annual loss for the industry. That number could climb, could China's implement retaliatory tariffs even higher." \[WISN (ABC), [4/8/25](https://www.wisn.com/article/a-whole-lot-of-uncertainty-tariffs-take-a-toll-on-wisconsin-farmers/64425479)\]
-   **The Top Three Countries That Bought Wisconsin Soybeans Were China, Canada, And Mexico.** According to WEAU, "As an ongoing trade war with China continues, Wisconsin farmers are bracing for the possible impacts.  With farmers ready to enter the fields, planting season starts with concerns over how tariffs will affect soybean exports.  ‘If you’ve ever looked down during the summer and see rolls of soybeans, two out of three rows get exported to a different country out of the United States,’ Dan Linse, a soybean farmer and member of the Wisconsin Soybean Association, said.  The top three countries that buy Wisconsin soybeans are China, Canada and Mexico. So, if there are ongoing tariffs against these countries, the farmers will feel it." \[WEAU, [4/15/25](https://www.weau.com/2025/04/15/soybean-farmer-shares-concerns-about-tariffs/)\] 

**One Wisconsin Farmer Expressed Concern Over The Impact Of Tariffs And Said She Didn’t Believe Tariffs Were The Right Solution Because Trump’s 2018 Trade War With China Led To Losses In The Soybean Market.** According to WKOW (ABC), "Farmers in Wisconsin are worried about the impacts of the tariffs on agricultural products like soybeans could have on the economy. Sara Stelter, the owner of Stelter Farms in Wautoma, Wisconsin, grows a variety of crops including green beans, corn, and soybeans. For farmers like her, prices are often determined by the commodity markets, especially when it comes to crops used in canning. However, with the growing uncertainty surrounding international trade deals, particularly the impact of tariffs, Stelter is concerned about the financial future of her farm. ‘When I raise canning crops, my prices are based on the commodity markets,’ Stelter said. ‘It's going to make us all take a really hard look at our bottom line and what kind of cuts we can make.’  While Stelter understands the need for the U.S. to ensure fair trade, she does not believe tariffs are the right solution. Reflecting on the 2018 trade war with China, she recalled how tariffs led to losses in the soybean market." \[WKOW (ABC), [3/5/25](https://www.wkow.com/news/wisconsin-farmer-expresses-concerns-over-tariffs-impact-on-agricultural-products/article_52090f88-fa17-11ef-8379-9f3d00a94ee4.html)\]

**Athens, WI Farmer Said Rapidly Changing Economic Conditions Made It Difficult For Her To Invest In Her Farm.** According to Wisconsin Public Radio, "Cattail Organics focuses primarily on growing vegetables, seedlings, maple syrup and herbs. Becker said the uncertainty surrounding funds and costs is taking a toll on farmers in her community.  ‘As farmers, we know the weather will be uncertain. We know there are things we can and cannot control. But being in a landscape where we aren’t sure what’s happening on a week to week basis, it is hard to make responsible and consistent economic choices,’ Becker said. ‘It’s difficult to be a good business person when you don’t have clear information.’  Becker said rapidly changing economic conditions make it difficult to invest in her farm." \[Wisconsin Public Radio, [4/25/25](https://www.wpr.org/news/wisconsins-growing-season-arriving-with-uncertainty-amid-usda-cuts-tariffs)\]
