<h2>Political Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>John Reid, the GOP nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, held far-right positions on several key issues:&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Supports Firing Federal Workers In Virginia</h3>
<p>Reid was a committed Trump supporter, and vocally backed even the Trump policies that harmed Virginia. Reid said of Trump’s mass firing of federal workers, many based in Virginia, “it’s bad and it’s gonna hurt but it has to be done.” Reid also defended Trump’s tariffs.</p>
<h3>Compared Abortion To Slavery</h3>
<p>Reid compared abortion to slavery, and called abortion “an atrocity that should be rare if allowed at all.” Reid also appeared to criticize pro-choice women, saying they believed “being able to kill their baby at any time before it’s born is a private and personal right.” In campaigning against abortion rights, Reid repeated the lie that women in Virginia could have abortions though the day of the baby’s birth, which no Virginia lawmaker had proposed. Reid supported Youngkin’s 15-week abortion ban proposal.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Wanted To Shut Down The Public School System</h3>
<p>Reid assailed Virginia’s public schools and called for them to be closed in favor of private schools. Reid said of public education in Virginia, “I say we break the whole system and start over… with vouchers to let people send their kids to their own choice!!!” In another Facebook post, Reid wrote, “It TRULY may be time to just close the public schools and hand out vouchers.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Opposed The Affordable Care Act</h3>
<p>As late as 2024, Reid attacked the Affordable Care Act and lamented that the law “won’t go away.” Reid claimed those who benefitted from the ACA used “every sob story” to uphold the law, and that he resented having to pay for “free healthcare” for “people who don’t want to work.” Reid claimed that paying for one’s own healthcare was a “patriotic responsibility.”&nbsp;</p>
