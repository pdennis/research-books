Jeff Van Drew has repeatedly taken credit for bringing home federal funding for local projects—even when he voted against the bills that actually funded them. His office has touted millions in earmarks, such as $4.6 million for rebuilding the Lake Lenape Dam, calling them wins he “secured” for South Jersey. But those earmarks were part of the 2024 government funding package that Van Drew voted against. The projects only became law because Congress passed that broader spending bill over his objections. Despite opposing it, Van Drew continues to promote the same earmarks as proof he delivers for his district.

### Van Drew publicly takes credit for district “earmark” (Community Project Funding) wins
- His office said the Lake Lenape Dam rebuild “was made possible after Congressman Van Drew secured $4.6 million in federal funding through a Community Project Funding Congressional earmark.” ([vandrew.house.gov](https://vandrew.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1902&utm_source=openai))
- His office also announced he “secured $4.6 million in funding” for the Lake Lenape Dam as part of FEMA’s budget when construction commenced in 2024. ([vandrew.house.gov](https://vandrew.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1745&utm_source=openai))
- Atlantic County’s official announcement tied the same $4.6 million Lake Lenape Dam award to the federal omnibus spending bill and credited Van Drew for helping land it. ([atlanticcountynj.gov](https://www.atlanticcountynj.gov/Home/Components/News/News/396/))
- Independent compilations of New Jersey earmarks list multiple projects attributed to “Van Drew” (e.g., $2 million for Lower Township MUA water mains; $2 million for Vineland Chestnut Avenue safety; $250,000 for Bangladesh Association of South Jersey; $2 million for Cape May Airport).

### These earmarks are enacted inside the annual appropriations packages
- Community Project Funding/earmarks are member-requested projects that are “selected” and “written into law each year as the annual appropriations process.” ([dot.ca.gov](https://dot.ca.gov/programs/local-assistance/fed-and-state-programs/earmark-programs))
- Congress’s FY2024 appropriations were finalized in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (H.R. 2882), which became Public Law 118-47 on March 23, 2024. ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2882/amendments))
- CRS tallies confirm CPF/earmark tables are embedded in the explanatory statements to recent appropriations laws (FY2022 P.L. 117-103; FY2023 P.L. 117-328; FY2024 P.L. 118-42). ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48471))

### He voted against the 2024 appropriations package while later touting CPF-funded projects
- On March 22, 2024, Van Drew voted “Nay” on the House motion to concur in the Senate amendment to H.R. 2882, the final FY2024 appropriations package. ([clerk.house.gov](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024102))
- Coverage of the March 2024 spending votes notes Van Drew opposed both funding bills that kept the government open, while New Jersey’s Democrats and Rep. Tom Kean Jr. supported them. ([newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/how-n-j-s-congressional-delegation-voted-in-march/))
- Months after those “no” votes, his office continued to highlight the $4.6 million CPF for the Lake Lenape Dam as a funding win he “secured” for the district. ([vandrew.house.gov](https://vandrew.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1902&utm_source=openai))

### The pattern: he requests/claims credit for CPFs while opposing the omnibus vehicles that carry them
- Van Drew publicly advocates continuing earmarks, saying “Nothing’s been dropped” and “We’re not giving up on FY2025” when a stopgap left CPFs out—demonstrating he seeks and values these projects even as he resists broader spending packages. ([newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/n-j-missed-out-on-219-million-in-federal-earmarks-under-stopgap-bill-but-are-they-gone-for-good/))
- Lists of funded New Jersey CPFs credit Van Drew for multiple district projects in the same appropriations cycles he opposed on final passage, illustrating the gap between his “no” votes on the omnibus and his promotion of the earmarked wins.
