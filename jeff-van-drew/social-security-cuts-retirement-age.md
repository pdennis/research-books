Jeff Van Drew helped move forward a House bill that cut the Social Security Administration’s budget by $250 million, even though the agency already faced long wait times and staff shortages. He is also part of a Republican caucus whose budget plans would raise the full retirement age to 69—an across-the-board cut of about 13% for future retirees. At the same time, a “fiscal commission” plan moving in the House would fast-track big changes to Social Security with limited debate, which AARP warns could be used to push through drastic cuts.

### Van Drew backed moving forward a House bill that cut the Social Security Administration’s operating budget by $250 mILLION, undermining benefit access and delivery
- The FY2024 House Labor–HHS–Education bill (H.R. 5894) proposed cutting SSA’s customer-service funding by about 2% ($250 million) despite already severe staffing shortages and record backlogs—cuts that would worsen wait times for claims and appeals.

- On November 14, 2023, Van Drew voted “Yea” on the key procedural vote (H. Res. 864, ordering the previous question) to advance H.R. 5894, helping move the bill—and its SSA cuts—forward in the House. The House Clerk’s roll call lists “Van Drew — Yea.” ([clerk.house.gov](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023646))

### He is aligned with a caucus whose budget blueprints call for future Social Security benefit cuts
- The House Republican Study Committee’s budget proposals call for raising the full retirement age to 69 and other changes that reduce future benefits (about a 13% cut when fully phased in), shifting costs onto workers and retirees.

- Van Drew is listed as a member of the Republican Study Committee, aligning him with the caucus advancing those benefit‑cutting ideas. ([RSC](https://rsc-pfluger.house.gov/media/press-releases/one-big-beautiful-bill-one-big-beautiful-win-america))

### Independent senior advocates warn that current “fiscal commission” proposals moving in the House are a vehicle to fast‑track Social Security cuts
- AARP opposed the House Fiscal Commission legislation when it advanced in January 2024, warning it would empower a small group to “ram through drastic cuts to Social Security and Medicare” via an expedited, unamendable process. ([press.aarp.org](https://press.aarp.org/2024-1-18-AARP-Statement-House-Committee-Approval-Fiscal-Commission-Legislation))
- The House Budget Committee advanced H.R. 5779 (Fiscal Commission Act), whose text establishes a commission and fast‑track procedures that limit amendments and force up‑or‑down votes on its package—including trust‑fund programs such as Social Security.
