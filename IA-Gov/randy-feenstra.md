# How To Win Against Randy Feenstra

Randy Feenstra built his career claiming to fight for Iowan families but voted to cut medical services and nutrition assistance while raising costs for Iowans. He voted to rip health insurance away from thousands of Iowans, supported massive cuts to Medicare, and backed the largest SNAP cuts in history. Feenstra cast the deciding vote to protect Trump’s tariffs, which drove up grocery prices and hurt small businesses and farmers across Iowa. He stood by while Trump’s DOGE cuts shut down federal offices, reduced nonprofit funding, and threatened the livelihoods of federal workers and seniors who rely on Social Security services. Feenstra previously recognized the importance of biofuel credits for Iowa’s economy, yet he supported GOP plans to gut the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean-energy incentives and jeopardize Iowa jobs. He advanced an extreme anti-abortion agenda, co-sponsored legislation establishing personhood at fertilization, and repeatedly voted against protecting abortion rights, contraception access, and out-of-state reproductive care. Feenstra initially voted against releasing the Epstein files and only supported their release once Trump approved it. He also promoted election denial claims and defended Trump after the January 6th insurrection.  
 

### Feenstra Voted For Devastating Health Care Cuts

-   In 2025, Randy Feenstra [voted for a bill](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) that is estimated to kick [17 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including [nearly 12 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) who rely on Medicaid. Nearly [107,000 Iowans](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) could lose their health insurance as a result of Feenstra’s vote. Randy Feenstra supported [work requirements for Medicaid](https://x.com/RepFeenstra/status/1942278519188267104) under Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” even though [58,721 Medicaid recipients](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) in Iowa were expected to lose their coverage by 2034. 
-   Randy Feenstra [opposed](https://www.radioiowa.com/2025/10/24/feenstra-says-gop-stands-firm-in-fight-over-aca-subsidies/) Affordable Care Act tax credits that reduced insurance costs for middle-income families, and instead promoted market competition and cash-payer discounts without a plan to protect people with pre-existing conditions. Nearly [137,000 Iowans](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/marketplace-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=0&selectedRows=%7B%22states%22:%7B%22iowa%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) were enrolled in Affordable Care Act Marketplace health insurance plans. The “One Big Beautiful Bill” and expiring ACA tax credits would result in [106,000 uninsured Iowans](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-will-increase-the-number-of-americans-without-health-coverage-in-every-state-and-congressional-district/#:~:text=Table_content:%20header:%20%7C%20State%20%7C%20Increase%20in,%7C%20Increase%20in%20uninsured%20population:%20+422%2C000%20%7C) by 2034.

**Message:** Randy Feenstra voted to make massive cuts to health care services seniors rely on.   
 

### Feenstra WAS THE DECIDING VOTE TO PROTECT TRUMP’S TARIFFS

-   In 2025, Randy Feenstra voted five times to protect Trump’s tariffs, including in April when he was the [deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect the tariffs from being repealed by Congress, dooming Iowans who relied on him to a trade war and [rising prices](https://www.press-citizen.com/story/news/local/2025/06/18/iowa-farmers-business-donald-trump-tariffs-impact/84242027007/). Tariffs are contributing to [higher food prices](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi) and are [hurting Iowa small businesses](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2025/11/29/after-slow-sales-small-businesses-feel-more-uneasy-ahead-of-the-holidays) and [farmers](https://www.kcrg.com/2025/11/14/iowas-economy-will-feel-more-impacts-than-other-states-tariffs-says-economist/). In April 2025, Trump’s devastating tariffs cost Iowa businesses nearly [$90 million](https://www.press-citizen.com/story/news/local/2025/06/18/iowa-farmers-business-donald-trump-tariffs-impact/84242027007/).
-   Despite this, Randy Feenstra told Iowans to trust Trump’s team to “[do their magic](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/randy-feenstra-the-fox-news-rundown-101625/s-PFgj9qsW7EH?si=cf5a1db5a11041ff8bee2c577450cbca&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing),” even though the [U.S. stock market crashed](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/04/nx-s1-5352362/markets-selloff-dow-trump-tariffs) due to Trump’s escalating global trade war.

More than [701,000 Iowans](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/ia.pdf) relied on Social Security benefits. 
-   Randy Feenstra [joined the DOGE Caucus](https://feenstra.house.gov/media/press-releases/feenstra-joins-doge-caucus-cut-reckless-government-spending-and-restore-fiscal) and [promoted codifying DOGE](https://x.com/RepFeenstra/status/1929601361458401764) cuts even though it resulted in federal funding cuts to [Iowa nonprofits](https://abcnews4.com/news/nation-world/president-donald-trump-elon-musk-doge-axes-24-million-in-americorps-funding-and-245-jobs-across-iowa-dollars-cut). Inspired by Trump’s DOGE, Iowa DOGE also threatened state [workforce programs](https://www.kcrg.com/2025/11/12/iowa-doge-task-force-looks-eliminate-training-program-community-colleges/). Trump threatened the livelihoods of [nearly 22,000 federal workers](https://www.cbpp.org/blog/sweeping-federal-worker-layoffs-leave-states-reeling) in Iowa as DOGE cuts also [closed federal offices in Iowa.](https://cbs2iowa.com/news/local/seven-federal-offices-closing-in-iowa-under-doge-cuts-but-savings-remain-unclear)
