Feenstra is a Republican who will represent the 4th Congressional District in northwest Iowa. He said he looks forward to Jan. 6, when the House of Representatives will consider what in the past has been a largely ceremonial confirmation of the Electoral College results. The Electoral College on Monday awarded Biden the votes needed to win the presidential election. Biden also won the popular vote. President Donald Trump has declined to acknowledge Biden’s victory and has challenged the results.” [Iowa Capital Dispatch, <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2020/12/18/feenstra-declines-to-call-biden-president-elect-eyes-debt-reduction-to-save-social-security/#:~:text=Feenstra%20said%20Hart's%20appeal%20should,to%20break%20up%20the%20monopoly.%E2%80%9D">12/18/20]</a></p>

Bureau that he was disappointed by the violence that had unfolded Wednesday, saying what started as peaceful protesters ‘got carried away.’ We had just a wonderful group over the last 24 hours to protest peacefully,’ Feenstra said in the full interview. ‘Obviously, in the last 4-6 hours, that changed dramatically and that’s just tragic and unfortunate. We live in this free country that we have freedoms and liberties, freedom of speech specifically, and this group got carried away. And it’s sad, it’s a very sad day for our country.’” [KCRG,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kcrg.com/2021/01/07/iowa-rep-feenstra-clarifies-description-of-protest-that-led-up-to-the-mob-attack-on-us-capitol/">1/7/21</a>]</p>
