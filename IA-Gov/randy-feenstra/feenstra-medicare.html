<h4>July 2025:&nbsp;Randy Feenstra Voted For The Final Version Of The “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Which Would Trigger Nearly $500 Billion In Medicare Cuts</h4>
<p><strong>July 2025: Randy Feenstra Voted For The Senate FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill, The “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Which Extended $4 Trillion In Expiring Tax Cuts, Added New Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025 Randy Feenstra voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, the “motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214. The bill was ultimately signed into law.

  <li><strong>The “One Big Beautiful Bill” Sped Up The Timeline For When The Medicare Trust Fund Will Become Insolvent, And Without Additional Action, The Bill Would Trigger A $500 Billion Cut In Medicare Funding Between 2026 And 2034.&nbsp;</strong>According to Medicare Advocacy, “On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1 – the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB).&nbsp;This sweeping legislation narrowly passed Congress through a special budget process (‘reconciliation’), which allowed it to pass the Senate with a simple majority vote rather than the usual 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. The law extends tax cuts that were first enacted in 2017 and funds other administration priorities. To help pay for these policies, it makes unprecedented cuts to critical safety-net programs that provide health care and other assistance. […] Even with these significant cuts, the Act is still projected to add at least $3.4 trillion to the national debt.[2] It also speeds up the timeline for when Medicare’s trust fund (which pays for hospital care) will become insolvent. If Congress takes no additional action, automatic spending cuts will be triggered, reducing Medicare funding by approximately $500 billion between 2026 and 2034.” [Medicare Advocacy,&nbsp;<a href="https://medicareadvocacy.org/impact-of-the-big-bill-on-medicare/#:~:text=The%20law%20imposes%20a%20nine,to%20make%20Medicare%20more%20affordable.">7/24/25</a>]</li>

<h4>May 2025: Randy Feenstra Voted For The House Republicans’ Reconciliation Bill, Which Would Trigger Nearly $500 Billion In Medicare Cuts</h4>
<p><strong>May 2025: Randy Feenstra Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill, The “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Which Included $3.8 Trillion In Tax Cuts Offset By $1.5 Trillion In Spending Reductions To Programs Like Medicaid And The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</strong> In May 2025, Randy Feenstra voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would provide for approximately $3.8 trillion in net tax cuts and $321 billion in military, border enforcement and judiciary spending, offset by $1.5 trillion in spending reductions, as instructed in the fiscal 2025 budget resolution. It would raise the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion and provide for increased spending on defense and border security, spending cuts on social safety net programs, such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It also includes a mix of tax breaks for businesses and individuals; tax increases on universities and foundations; and a phase-down of clean energy tax credits. […] It would reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by requiring states to shoulder more of the cost, expand work requirements for SNAP, extend programs authorized under the 2018 farm bill, and prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Program. As amended, it would cap state and local tax deductions at $40,000 for households with incomes below $500,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 215 to 214.

  <li><strong>HEADLINE: "Trump And GOP’s Tax Bill Would Force Cuts To Medicare, CBO Says"</strong> [Washington Post,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/">5/21/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Congressional Budget Office Estimated That The House Republican Reconciliation Bill Would Trigger Nearly $500 Billion In Cuts To Medicare.&nbsp;</strong>According to a letter the Congressional Budget Office sent to Rep. Brendan Boyle, "Today the Congressional Budget Office transmitted an estimate of the budgetary effects of the 2025 reconciliation bill, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Budget on May 18, 2025. 1 CBO has not yet completed estimates of the effects of interactions among the titles of the legislation. This letter responds to your questions concerning the sequestration (the cancellation of budgetary resources) in accordance with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (S-PAYGO) that would occur if an enacted bill raised deficits by $2.3 trillion over 10 years. Under S-PAYGO, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is required to maintain 5- and 10-year scorecards that it updates with the estimated cumulative changes in revenues and outlays generated by newly enacted legislation. […] The 4 percent maximum reduction in Medicare spending would apply to sequestration orders for years after 2026. If OMB ordered a sequestration of $230 billion for each year through 2034, the ordered reductions in Medicare spending would increase to about $75 billion in 2034 and would total roughly $490 billion over the 2027–2034 period."

<h3>Feenstra Voted Against Capping Insulin Costs At $35 Dollars Per Month For Seniors And Families</h3>

[…] The bill would cap cost-sharing for insulin under both Medicare and private health insurance at $35 for a month’s supply, or 25% of a plan’s negotiated price, whichever is less. It would go into effect in 2023. […] Reps. Ashley Hinson and Randy Feenstra, who represent Northeast and Northwest Iowa, respectively, voted against it.” [Iowa Starting Line, <a href="https://iowastartingline.com/2022/04/03/hinson-feenstra-vote-against-insulin-price-cap-axne-and-miller-meeks-support/">4/3/22</a>]</p>

  <li><strong>As Of 2022, More Than 230,000 Iowans Relied On Insulin.</strong> According to Iowa Starting Line, “More than 230,000 Iowans have diabetes and rely on insulin for their health. Because of the high costs, many people ration their insulin by taking less than is required to try to make it last longer. Rationing can have severe health effects though, such as diabetic ketoacidosis which happens when a person’s blood sugar is too high, and can lead to death.” [Iowa Starting Line,&nbsp;<a href="https://iowastartingline.com/2022/08/08/chuck-grassley-blocks-effort-to-cap-insulin-prices-for-many-iowans/#:~:text=More%20than%20230%2C000%20Iowans%20have,and%20can%20lead%20to%20death">8/8/22</a>]</li>
