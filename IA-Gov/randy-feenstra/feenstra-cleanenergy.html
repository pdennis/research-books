<h2>Randy Feenstra Voted Against Protecting Iowa’s Clean Energy Jobs</h2>
<h3>Randy Feenstra Voted To Cut Clean Energy Tax Credits That Supported Iowa Jobs&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>July 2025: Randy Feenstra Voted For The “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Which Cut Inflation Reduction Act Clean Energy Tax Credits And Made It Harder For Projects To Qualify For Clean Energy Tax Credits</h4>
<p><strong>July 2025: Randy Feenstra</strong> <strong>Voted For The Senate FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill, The “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Which Extended $4 Trillion In Expiring Tax Cuts, Added New Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025, Randy Feenstra voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, the “motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214. The bill was ultimately signed into law.

  <li><strong>The Republican Reconciliation Bill Restricted The Ability Of Projects To Qualify For Certain Clean Energy Tax Credits And Repealed Electric Vehicle Tax Credits.&nbsp;</strong>According to Utility Dive, "The bill restricts the ability of projects to qualify for the tech-neutral clean electricity 45Y production tax credit and 48E investment tax credit, shortens the timeline for those credits, and ends the 25D residential solar credit after this year. The 25E, 30D, 30C and 45W electric vehicle credits will terminate after Sept. 30. While clean energy advocates and congressional Democrats maintain that the final version of the bill goes too far in slashing IRA credits, some Republicans wanted to see more significant cuts."

  <li><strong>The Final Republican Reconciliation Bill Allowed Projects To Avoid A Requirement That They Be In Service By 2027 To Qualify For Certain Credits If They Began Construction Within A Year Of The Bill Being Signed.&nbsp;</strong>According to Utility Dive, "Before the House Freedom Caucus reached an agreement with House leadership to vote in favor of the bill, the caucus circulated a memo that criticized the Senate’s version of the bill for offering an exemption from the House’s onerous requirement that clean energy projects be placed in service by 2027 to qualify for the 45Y and 48E credits. The Senate version allows projects to avoid this requirement if they begin construction within a year after the bill is signed into law."

<h4>May 2025: Randy Feenstra Voted For The House Republican Budget Bill, Which Cut Clean Energy Tax Credits Provided By The Inflation Reduction Act</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Randy Feenstra Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Included $3.8 Trillion In Tax Cuts Offset By $1.5 Trillion In Spending Reductions To Programs Like Medicaid And The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</strong> In May 2025, Randy Feenstra voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would provide for approximately $3.8 trillion in net tax cuts and $321 billion in military, border enforcement and judiciary spending, offset by $1.5 trillion in spending reductions, as instructed in the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). It would raise the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion and provide for increased spending on defense and border security, spending cuts on social safety net programs, such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It also includes a mix of tax breaks for businesses and individuals; tax increases on universities and foundations; and a phase-down of clean energy tax credits. […] It would reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by requiring states to shoulder more of the cost, expand work requirements for SNAP, extend programs authorized under the 2018 farm bill, and prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Program. As amended, it would cap state and local tax deductions at $40,000 for households with incomes below $500,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 215 to 214.

  <li><strong>The House Republican Budget Bill Included Cuts To Federal Tax Credits For Wind, Solar, Storage, And Other Clean Energy Projects.</strong> According to Utility Dive, "House Republicans on Thursday morning narrowly passed a sweeping budget bill that guts federal support for wind, solar, storage and other clean energy industries. The bill terminates most technology-neutral clean energy tax credits for projects placed in service after 2028 and those that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill’s passage. It also tightens restrictions on foreign entities’ involvement in projects, creating a ‘truly untenable’ situation for developers, Jefferies analysts said Thursday. Nuclear projects have more time to qualify for the credit."

  <li><strong>One Trade Association CEO Said The Bill Would Weaken Power Systems, Send Shockwaves Through The U.S. Economy, And Kill Tens Of Thousands Of Jobs.</strong> According to Utility Dive, "The House bill ‘abruptly dismantles bipartisan, long-standing tax policy that has catalyzed billions in private investment for affordable, reliable energy while sparking a rebirth of manufacturing across America,’ AEU President and CEO Heather O’Neill said. ‘If enacted as written, this bill will weaken our power system and send shockwaves throughout the U.S. economy by raising electricity prices, killing tens of thousands of jobs and ceding energy dominance to China.’" [Utility Dive, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-gop-budget-worse-than-feared-for-clean-energy-analysts/748862/">5/22/25</a>]<br>&nbsp;</li>

<h3>Clean Energy Advocates Warned Iowa Could Lose Jobs And Face Higher Utility Costs Under The Gop Reconciliation Bill</h3>
<p><strong>June 2025: Clean Energy Advocates Warned Iowa Could Lose Jobs And Face Higher Utility Costs Under The GOP Reconciliation Bill’s Elimination Of Inflation Reduction Act Clean Energy Tax Credits.</strong> According to KCRG, “Clean energy advocates said Iowa stands to lose jobs, manufacturing facilities, renewable energy project expansions and face more expensive utility bills if Congress passes the budget reconciliation bill as is.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these credits were extended via the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which put them under attack from Republican lawmakers opposed to the green policies. Renewable energy advocates say continued investment into wind, solar and other clean energy sources, regardless of environmental impact, is vital to meeting growing energy demands. Nearly three-fifths of Iowa’s total electricity generation comes from renewable sources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which also reports Iowa is one of the top states for solar and wind energy generation. Since 2019, Iowa has generated more electricity via wind than from coal and continues to grow its solar production. […] Per the reconciliation bill text as it passed the House May 22, the bill would terminate clean vehicle credits, residential energy efficiency credits, hydrogen fuel credits and place restrictions on credits for clean electricity production, zero-emission nuclear energy production and other sectors.” [KCRG, <a href="https://www.kcrg.com/2025/06/06/clean-energy-tax-cuts-reconciliation-budget-would-stall-renewable-energy-projects-iowa">6/6/25</a>]<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Prior To Voting To Eliminate Clean Energy Tax Credits In 2025, Feenstra Voted For LEgislation Only After Biofuel Tax Credits Were Preserved In 2023</h3>
<p><strong>2023: Feenstra Voted For The Limit, Save, Grow Act Of 2023, Which Was The GOP Debt Limit Package That Sought To Suspend The Federal Debt Limit Through March 14, 2024 Or Until An Additional $1.5 Trillion.</strong> In April 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Feenstra voted for the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023, which would “suspend the statutory limit on federal debt through March 31, 2024, or until an additional $1.5 trillion has been borrowed — whichever occurs first.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 217 to 215, thus the bill was sent to the Senate.

<p><strong>2023: Feenstra And The Iowa Congressional Delegation Agreed To Vote For The Limit, Save, Grow Act After Proposed Cuts To Biofuel Tax Credits Were Removed, Emphasizing The Importance Of The Tax Credits For Iowa’s Farmers And Economy.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Des Moines Register, “Iowa's four Republican congressional members who were holding up their leadership's debt-ceiling bill because it stripped out biofuel tax credits agreed to vote for the legislation Wednesday afternoon after those credits were restored. But Iowa's delegation helped provide the vital votes to push it to approval. ‘The biofuels industry drives the Iowa economy and is vital to our nation's energy security. We are proud to deliver a major victory for this industry and our whole state in these negotiations,’ delegation members Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, Zach Nunn and Randy Feenstra said in a joint statement. ‘Since this proposal was unveiled, our delegation has stood united for Iowa’s farmers and producers fighting to amend the bill to protect biofuels tax credits. Having successfully amended the bill to protect funding for these tax credits, our delegation will vote for this legislation, which is a starting point to avoid a default and cut wasteful spending.’” [Des Moines Register,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/26/iowa-gop-congressmen-will-vote-for-debt-ceiling-deal-after-concessions/70154329007/">4/26/23</a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Inflation Reduction Act Extended Or Created The Biofuel Tax Credits Which The Limit, Save, Grow Act Initially Sought To Eliminate.</strong> According to the Des Moines Register, “An earlier version of the plan, spearheaded by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, would have eliminated tax credits on biodiesel production and blending, as well as sales and use of low-carbon biofuels like ethanol. It also would have scaled back a tax credit program aimed at carbon sequestration pipelines for ethanol plants. The programs were extended or created as part of 2022's Inflation Reduction Act, a Democrat-approved plan from Biden that directed new federal spending toward climate, health care and tax programs. Republicans have sought to roll back several major line items in that law, calling them excessive spending and expansion of government.” [Des Moines Register,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/26/iowa-gop-congressmen-will-vote-for-debt-ceiling-deal-after-concessions/70154329007/">4/26/23</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>2023: The Limit, Save, Grow Act Was A “Watered-Down Plan” Of GOP Priorities On The Budget, Including Rolling Back Climate Initiatives From The Inflation Reduction Act.</strong> According to the New York Times, “Instead of a budget, House G.O.P. leaders unveiled the Limit, Save, Grow Act — a substantially watered-down plan that dropped the party’s aspirations for balancing the budget and imposing draconian cuts — and urged their members to unite around the bill to try to force Mr. Biden to the negotiating table. […] The legislation would raise the debt ceiling into next year in exchange for freezing spending at last year’s levels for a decade — a nearly 14 percent cut — as well as rolling back parts of Mr. Biden’s landmark health, climate and tax law, imposing work requirements on social programs, and expanding mining and fossil fuel production.” [New York Times,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/04/26/us/debt-ceiling-vote-news">4/26/23</a>]</li>
