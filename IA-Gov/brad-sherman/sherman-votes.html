<h3>Brad Sherman Voted For Medicaid And SNAP Eligibility Restrictions, Which Was “Expected To Kick Thousands Of Iowans Off Of Medicaid And SNAP Benefits”</h3>
<p><strong>April 2023: Brad Sherman Voted For SF 494, Which Made Eligibility Changes To SNAP, Medicaid, CHIP, And The</strong> <strong>Family Investment Program.&nbsp;</strong>In April 2023, according to the Iowa Legislature, Brad Sherman voted for Senate File 494, which “makes various changes related to public assistance programs under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Changes by section include the following: • Section 1 creates various definitions, including defining ‘public assistance’ as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Medicaid Program, the Family Investment Program (FIP), and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); ‘asset’ as liquid assets and other personal property excluding one vehicle and the fair market value in excess of $10,000 of an additional vehicle; and ‘asset test’ as including the value of all assets of all members of the applicant’s household up to $15,000. • Section 2 establishes the gross countable monthly income threshold for SNAP in Iowa at 160.0% of the federal poverty level (FPL) for the household.” Senate File 494 passed the Iowa House by a vote of 58 to 41, and the bill was ultimately signed into law.

  <li><strong>Governor Reynolds Signed Senate File 494 Into Law, Which Was “Expected To Kick Thousands Of Iowans Off Of Medicaid And SNAP Benefits.”</strong> According to the Des Moines Register, “Iowans receiving public assistance will soon face new asset tests and eligibility checks, the culmination of a years-long push by Iowa Republicans to impose stricter requirements on benefit programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;The move is expected to kick thousands of Iowans off of Medicaid and SNAP benefits and has drawn the condemnation of food banks and pantries that say they are already struggling to keep up with the need. To help soften the blow, Gov. Kim Reynolds promised to use federal funding to expand food banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Senate File 494, which Reynolds signed Thursday, will require Iowa families receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds to undergo a new asset test before they can obtain food assistance. And Iowans receiving a range of benefits, including from Medicaid and other public health care programs, will face regular checks to make sure they qualify.” [Des Moines Register,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/01/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-law-with-stricter-requirements-for-snap-medicaid/70147962007/">6/2/23</a>]</li>

The nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency estimates that, beginning in fiscal year 2026, about 1% of Iowans will have their benefits canceled ‘due to discrepancies.’ That means about 8,000 Medicaid recipients and 2,800 SNAP recipients would be kicked out of the programs.” [Des Moines Register,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/01/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-law-with-stricter-requirements-for-snap-medicaid/70147962007/">6/2/23</a>]</li>

<h3>Brad Sherman Sponsored Legislation Tightening Medicaid Eligibility</h3>
<p><strong>January 2023: Brad Sherman Sponsored HF 3, A Public Assistance Crackdown That Tightened Medicaid Eligibility.&nbsp;</strong>In January 2023, according to the Iowa Legislature, Brad Sherman was an original sponsor of House File 3, which included provisions stating that “the department shall establish and implement an asset test and verification procedures for applicants and recipients under the supplemental nutrition assistance program;” directing that “the department of health and human services shall apply for any federal waiver necessary to implement work or community engagement requirements under the medical assistance program;” and requiring that “the department shall seek federal approval to restrict eligible food items for recipients under the supplemental nutrition assistance program to those items eligible for purchase under the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children.” HF 3 advanced out of a House Health and Human Services subcommittee on a 2 to 1 vote. The bill was later amended and renumbered as HF 613, but legislation did not ultimately become law.

  <li><strong>2023: Advocates Raised Alarms That New Medicaid Work Requirements And New Identity Verification Procedures Would Harm Iowans.</strong> According to the Iowa Capital Dispatch, “Lobbyists representing groups including the Iowa Food Bank Association, Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Des Moines Area Religious Council said these proposals would not only create administrative burdens for the state government and those helping Iowans in need, but also could keep people who need help through public assistance programs from getting that aid. Advocates voiced concerns about other changes to Iowa’s public assistance programs laid out in the legislation outside of the WIC food limitations. The bill proposes new asset restrictions on Iowans who receive SNAP and Medicaid benefits. It also would require Medicaid recipients work 20 hours a week as well as implement new identity verification procedures.” [Iowa Capital Dispatch,&nbsp;<a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2023/01/26/lawmakers-advance-proposed-snap-changes-but-say-theyll-drop-plans-to-restrict-some-foods/">1/26/23</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>2023: The Legislation Would Have Imposed Asset Tests That Would Have Excluded Many Low-Income Iowans From Receiving Public Assistance, Like Owning More Than One Vehicle.</strong> According to the Iowa Capital Dispatch, “The asset tests would keep poor Iowans from getting benefits if they have more than one car, which advocates said was unrealistic for households with multiple people who work or have children. The 20-hour-a-week work requirement is unrealistic, advocates said, for people who need Medicaid to&nbsp;treat illnesses so they can work in the future.” [Iowa Capital Dispatch, <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2023/01/26/lawmakers-advance-proposed-snap-changes-but-say-theyll-drop-plans-to-restrict-some-foods/">1/26/23</a>]</li>

  <li><strong>The New Law Required Snap Recipients To Undergo New Asset Tests And Barred Families With Liquid Assets Greater Than $15,000 From Receiving SNAP.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Des Moines Register, “Senate File 494, which Reynolds signed Thursday, will require Iowa families receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds to undergo a new asset test before they can obtain food assistance. And Iowans receiving a range of benefits, including from Medicaid and other public health care programs, will face regular checks to make sure they qualify. […] One of the most controversial elements of the law is the new asset test to receive SNAP benefits, which are currently available, without an asset test, to Iowans making up to 160% of the federal poverty level. That's about $48,000 for a family of four. Once the new law takes effect, any Iowa households with liquid assets of more than $15,000 will not be allowed to receive SNAP benefits. The limit does not count the value of a home, the household's first car and up to $10,000 of the value of a second household car.” [Des Moines Register,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/01/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-law-with-stricter-requirements-for-snap-medicaid/70147962007/">6/2/23</a>]</li>

  <li><strong>Food Banks And Pantries In Iowa Were Worried The New SNAP Restrictions Would Increase Demand For Food Assistance As Iowans Would Lose Their Benefits.</strong> According to the Des Moines Register, “Iowa's food banks and food pantries are worried the law could steer more people to use their services if they lose SNAP benefits, at a time when food banks are already seeing record need.” [Des Moines Register,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/01/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-law-with-stricter-requirements-for-snap-medicaid/70147962007/">6/2/23</a>]</li>

It would also require an asset limit on SNAP participants and Medicare recipients would need to work at least 20 hours a week to receive benefits.

Brad Sherman (R-Williamsburg) sent from his legislative account late Wednesday afternoon to all representatives in the House in which he defended the bills and the rationale behind them. In the email, Sherman said, ‘many of the objections appear to be based largely on misguided emotions without understanding the actual bills.’ […] Sherman also said the bills don’t violate anyone’s civil rights—they do—and that they aren’t telling same-sex couples what to believe because ‘if they want to call their relationship a marriage, they are free to do so; that is freedom. But by the same token, people who do not define same-sex unions as marriage must not be forced to do so.’” [Iowa Starting Line, <a href="https://iowastartingline.com/2023/03/02/sponsor-of-iowa-gop-bills-to-ban-gay-marriage-says-thats-not-what-the-bills-are-about/">3/2/23</a>]</p>
