<h2>Brad Sherman Dismissed Concerns About Trump’s Tariffs Despite Clear Risks To Iowa’s Economy</h2>
<h3>Brad Sherman Dismissed Concerns About Trump’s Devastating Tariffs, Even As The Stock Market Crashed</h3>
<p><strong>April 2025: Sherman Dismissed Concerns About Trump’s Tariffs, Claiming Everyone “Knew That The Tariffs Would Have Some Ups And Some Downs,” But Said He Was “Not Too Worried.”</strong> According to the Washington Post, “Brad Sherman, a pastor and former state representative who has been running for governor as a Republican, predicted the state would continue trending Republican and expressed little concern about political backlash from Trump’s tariffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘We all knew that the tariffs would have some ups and downs to it,’ Sherman said. ‘I’m not too worried about it at this point. There’s lot of other issues in Iowa that will affect the economy.’” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/24/iowa-democrats-midterms-trump-tariffs/">4/24/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>April 2-4, 2025: The U.S. Stock Market Crashed As Trump’s Tariffs “Escalated A Global Trade War And Wiped Out Trillions Of Dollars In Value.”</strong> According to NPR, “Wall Street plummeted for a second straight day on Friday, as President Trump's tariffs escalated a global trade war and wiped out trillions of dollars in value from the U.S. stock market.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-day selloff served as the financial community's most brutal warning yet about the potential fallout of Trump's trade policy. Investors, businesses, and consumers are all expressing mounting terror about how these sweeping new taxes could upend the global economy.” [NPR, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/04/nx-s1-5352362/markets-selloff-dow-trump-tariffs">4/4/25</a>]</p>

<h3>Trump’s Tariffs Were Hurting Small Businesses And Farmers In Iowa</h3>

<p><strong>HEADLINE: “Tariffs Cost Iowa Businesses $90M In April, New Report Says, A 304% Hike From 2024”</strong> [Iowa City Press-Citizen,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.press-citizen.com/story/news/local/2025/06/18/iowa-farmers-business-donald-trump-tariffs-impact/84242027007/">6/18/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>Iowa Farmers For Free Trade: April 2025: Trump’s Tariffs Triggered A 304% Surge In Iowa Tariffs And Added Nearly $90 Million In New Expenses That Would Hurt Iowa Farmers And Businesses.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Iowa City Press-Citizen, “Tariffs are having a sweeping impact on Iowa's economy, costing importers $90 million in April, a 304% increase from the year prior, according to new research. The data was released by Iowa Farmers for Free Trade and aggregated by Tarifflation during a roundtable event on Tuesday, June 17, at the Cedar Ridge Distillery in Swisher.&nbsp;&nbsp;Iowa has the 11th highest change in the amount of tariffs paid between April 2024 and 2025. The report attributed the increase to President Donald Trump's ever-evolving tariff policies, with approximately $80 million from ‘executive actions.’ Import tariff costs from measures approved by the legislature have remained largely unchanged over the past year. The new data may not even capture the full impact on Iowa's economy since the Trump administration has paused the worldwide ‘reciprocal tariffs’ through mid-July. If those tariffs take effect, the report said, there could be ‘major consequences for Iowa businesses with extensive trade relationships around the world.’” [Iowa City Press-Citizen,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.press-citizen.com/story/news/local/2025/06/18/iowa-farmers-business-donald-trump-tariffs-impact/84242027007/">6/18/25</a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Drake University Professor Dr. Thomas Root: Trump’s Tariffs Hurt Iowa Farmers And Delayed Key Agricultural Investments That Supported Local Economies.</strong> According to KCRG, “Drake University Professor Dr. Thomas Root said Iowa’s economy feels tariff changes more intensely than other states.&nbsp;&nbsp;He said the state’s economy relies so heavily on agriculture that any hits to farmers create widespread effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘It doesn’t just hurt the farmer. The farmer then puts off doing things like buying new equipment. They put off doing things that are going to help their local economy in terms of spending and things like that. And so it spills over to the rest of the local economy in that lost income,’ Root said.” [KCRG,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kcrg.com/2025/11/14/iowas-economy-will-feel-more-impacts-than-other-states-tariffs-says-economist/">11/14/25</a>]<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>2025: Tariffs Raised Prices On Imported Goods And Increased Costs For Iowa Small Businesses, Including Simply Nourished Market &amp; Mercantile In Mason City.&nbsp;</strong>According to MPR News, “Melissa Fabian opened Simply Nourished Market &amp; Mercantile four years ago in Mason City, Iowa. Shoppers can find organic produce and grass-fed lamb from nearby farms and bakeware made across the border in Minnesota at the brick-and-mortar shop.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘We are built upon the backbone of supporting local first,’ Fabian said. ‘So, when you walk into our store, you're really going to see a variety of Iowa and Midwest products.’&nbsp;[…] ‘We are paying for the cost of getting the goods to us, and so that has to be reflected in the price of our goods,’ she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;Though imports are a smaller slice of her inventory, Fabian said tariffs spiked prices for olive oil, coffee and some of the kitchenware she sells.” [MPR News,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2025/11/29/after-slow-sales-small-businesses-feel-more-uneasy-ahead-of-the-holidays">11/29/25</a>]<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>November 2025: 56% Of Iowa Small Businesses Reported Net Profit Losses.&nbsp;</strong>According to MPR News, “A national survey from nonprofit Main Street America found that 45 percent of the nearly 1,300 small business owners who responded experienced a drop in net profit this fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘In Iowa, just one example, those numbers were more severe,’ said Michael Powe, senior director of research at Main Street America. ‘Fifty-six percent had a net profit decrease.’&nbsp;&nbsp;Around two-thirds of the survey respondents in Iowa and the U.S. at large were from rural areas, Powe said. Over 60 percent said they were in the retail and food and beverage sectors.” [MPR News,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2025/11/29/after-slow-sales-small-businesses-feel-more-uneasy-ahead-of-the-holidays">11/29/25</a>]</li>
