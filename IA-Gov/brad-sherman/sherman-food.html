<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In 2023, Brad Sherman <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/HJNL/20230413_HJNL.pdf#page=20">voted</a> for <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/FN/1371875.pdf">legislation</a> that restricted SNAP eligibility for Iowans, and was expected to kick <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/01/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-law-with-stricter-requirements-for-snap-medicaid/70147962007/">thousands of Iowans off of Medicaid and SNAP benefits</a>. He also sponsored a separate public assistance crackdown <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF3&amp;ga=90">targeting SNAP and Medicaid</a> in Iowa. The proposal <a href="https://time.com/6249096/iowa-bill-threatens-snap/">restricted eligibility</a> and limited allowable food purchases, and drew warnings from hunger advocates that it would make <a href="https://time.com/6249096/iowa-bill-threatens-snap/">SNAP less accessible</a> during rising food insecurity.

<h2>Brad Sherman Voted For And Sponsored Legislation To Restrict SNAP Access For Thousands Of Iowans</h2>
<h3>Brad Sherman Voted For A Public Assistance Crackdown That Restricted SNAP Access And Was Expected To Leave Thousands Of Iowans Without SNAP Benefits</h3>
<h4>Brad Sherman Voted For Medicaid And SNAP Eligibility Restrictions, Which Was “Expected To Kick Thousands Of Iowans Off Of Medicaid And SNAP Benefits”</h4>
<p><strong>April 2023: Brad Sherman Voted For SF 494, Which Made Eligibility Changes To SNAP, Medicaid, CHIP, And The</strong> <strong>Family Investment Program.&nbsp;</strong>In April 2023, according to the Iowa Legislature, Brad Sherman voted for Senate File 494, which “makes various changes related to public assistance programs under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Changes by section include the following: • Section 1 creates various definitions, including defining ‘public assistance’ as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Medicaid Program, the Family Investment Program (FIP), and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); ‘asset’ as liquid assets and other personal property excluding one vehicle and the fair market value in excess of $10,000 of an additional vehicle; and ‘asset test’ as including the value of all assets of all members of the applicant’s household up to $15,000. • Section 2 establishes the gross countable monthly income threshold for SNAP in Iowa at 160.0% of the federal poverty level (FPL) for the household.” Senate File 494 passed the Iowa House by a vote of 58 to 41, and the bill was ultimately signed into law. [Iowa Legislature – <a href="http://legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=90&amp;ba=SF494">Senate File 494</a>; Iowa House Of Representatives, <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/HJNL/20230413_HJNL.pdf#page=20">4/13/23</a>; Legislative Services Agency – Fiscal Note, <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/FN/1371875.pdf">5/9/23</a>]&nbsp;</p>

  <li><strong>The New Law Required Snap Recipients To Undergo New Asset Tests And Barred Families With Liquid Assets Greater Than $15,000 From Receiving SNAP.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Des Moines Register, “Senate File 494, which Reynolds signed Thursday, will require Iowa families receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds to undergo a new asset test before they can obtain food assistance. And Iowans receiving a range of benefits, including from Medicaid and other public health care programs, will face regular checks to make sure they qualify. […] One of the most controversial elements of the law is the new asset test to receive SNAP benefits, which are currently available, without an asset test, to Iowans making up to 160% of the federal poverty level. That's about $48,000 for a family of four. Once the new law takes effect, any Iowa households with liquid assets of more than $15,000 will not be allowed to receive SNAP benefits. The limit does not count the value of a home, the household's first car and up to $10,000 of the value of a second household car.” [Des Moines Register,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/01/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-law-with-stricter-requirements-for-snap-medicaid/70147962007/">6/2/23</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The New Law Imposed New Identity Verification Protocols.</strong> According to the Des Moines Register, “The law requires state agencies that deliver benefits, such as the Department of Health and Human Services and Iowa Workforce Development, to check new sources of information to determine if Iowans are eligible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Iowans could be enrolled in benefit programs, they will need to verify their identity through a questionnaire that could be completed online, in person or by phone — but can't be done through a paper application.” [Des Moines Register,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/01/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-law-with-stricter-requirements-for-snap-medicaid/70147962007/">6/2/23</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Food Banks And Pantries In Iowa Were Worried The New SNAP Restrictions Would Increase Demand For Food Assistance As Iowans Would Lose Their Benefits.</strong> According to the Des Moines Register, “Iowa's food banks and food pantries are worried the law could steer more people to use their services if they lose SNAP benefits, at a time when food banks are already seeing record need.” [Des Moines Register,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/01/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-law-with-stricter-requirements-for-snap-medicaid/70147962007/">6/2/23</a>]</li>

<p><strong>2023: Governor Reynolds Signed Senate File 494 Into Law, Which Was “Expected To Kick Thousands Of Iowans Off Of Medicaid And SNAP Benefits.”</strong> According to the Des Moines Register, “Iowans receiving public assistance will soon face new asset tests and eligibility checks, the culmination of a years-long push by Iowa Republicans to impose stricter requirements on benefit programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;The move is expected to kick thousands of Iowans off of Medicaid and SNAP benefits and has drawn the condemnation of food banks and pantries that say they are already struggling to keep up with the need. To help soften the blow, Gov. Kim Reynolds promised to use federal funding to expand food banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Senate File 494, which Reynolds signed Thursday, will require Iowa families receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds to undergo a new asset test before they can obtain food assistance. And Iowans receiving a range of benefits, including from Medicaid and other public health care programs, will face regular checks to make sure they qualify.” [Des Moines Register, <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/01/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-law-with-stricter-requirements-for-snap-medicaid/70147962007/">6/2/23</a>]</p>

  <li><strong>2023: The New Law Was Expected To Affect 287,000 Iowans Who Received SNAP To Afford Groceries And More Than 800,000 Iowa Medicaid Recipients.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Des Moines Register, “Among those affected by the new law are the roughly 287,000 Iowans who receive SNAP benefits each month and the more than 800,000 Iowans receiving health care through Medicaid. The nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency estimates that, beginning in fiscal year 2026, about 1% of Iowans will have their benefits canceled ‘due to discrepancies.’ That means about 8,000 Medicaid recipients and 2,800 SNAP recipients would be kicked out of the programs.” [Des Moines Register,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/01/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-law-with-stricter-requirements-for-snap-medicaid/70147962007/">6/2/23</a>]</li>

  <li><strong>The Legislative Services Agency Also Estimated 600 Iowans Would Be Removed From CHIP And 100 Iowans Would Be Removed From The Family Investment Program.</strong> According to the Des Moines Register, “The agency estimates 600 people would be removed from the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and 100 would be removed from the Family Investment Program.” [Des Moines Register,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/01/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-signs-law-with-stricter-requirements-for-snap-medicaid/70147962007/">6/2/23</a>]</li>

<h4><br>Brad Sherman Sponsored Legislation Tightening SNAP Eligibility, Which Iowa Hunger Coalition Warned Would Make SNAP Less Accessible</h4>
<p><strong>HEADLINE: “Iowa’s GOP Wants To Limit Snap’s Food List. Here’s How It Could Impact The Most Vulnerable Communities”</strong> [Time, <a href="https://time.com/6249096/iowa-bill-threatens-snap/">1/21/23</a>]</p>
<p><strong>January 2023: Brad Sherman Sponsored HF 3, A Public Assistance Crackdown That Tightened SNAP Eligibility.&nbsp;</strong>In January 2023, according to the Iowa Legislature, Brad Sherman was an original sponsor of House File 3, Brad Sherman was an original sponsor of House File 3, which included provisions stating that “the department shall establish and implement an asset test and verification procedures for applicants and recipients under the supplemental nutrition assistance program;” directing that “the department of health and human services shall apply for any federal waiver necessary to implement work or community engagement requirements under the medical assistance program;” and requiring that “the department shall seek federal approval to restrict eligible food items for recipients under the supplemental nutrition assistance program to those items eligible for purchase under the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children.” HF 3 advanced through the House Health and Human Services Committee following a 2 to 1 subcommittee vote and was later renumbered as HF 613 after amendment, but legislation did not ultimately become law. [Iowa Legislature – <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF3&amp;ga=90">House File 3</a>; Iowa House Of Representatives, Introduced <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/billTracking/billHistory?billName=HF%20613&amp;ga=90">1/11/23</a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>January 2023: HF 3 Proposed Limiting SNAP Purchases To WIC-Approved Foods And Imposing New Work Requirements.&nbsp;</strong>According to Time, “The bill, which 39 Republicans co-sponsored, would require SNAP recipients to have a more restrictive list of food items they can buy that would mirror the foods approved for the state’s current Women, Infants, and Children Program (WIC). It would also require an asset limit on SNAP participants and Medicare recipients would need to work at least 20 hours a week to receive benefits. House File 3 is getting substantial pushback from state Democrats and hunger advocacy groups who argue that the bill will negatively affect those that are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food and still reeling from inflation and job loss brought by the pandemic.” [Time,&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/6249096/iowa-bill-threatens-snap/">1/21/23</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>January 2023: Iowa Hunger Coalition Chair Luke Elzinga Warned HF 3 Would Make SNAP Less Accessible As Food Insecurity Increased.&nbsp;</strong>According to Time, “‘I’ve been telling legislators in the state of Iowa, we have food banks and food pantries that are breaking records in terms of the number of people that are turning to them for assistance,’ Luke Elzinga, chair of the Iowa Hunger Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for equitable food policy, tells TIME. ‘At the same time, the number of Iowans enrolled in SNAP is actually at a 14-year low.’&nbsp;‘That tells me the state needs to be doing more to make sure SNAP is accessible for people facing food insecurity, and House File 3 seems to be headed in the opposite direction,’ he adds.” [Time, <a href="https://time.com/6249096/iowa-bill-threatens-snap/">1/21/23</a>]</p>

<h3>2025: More Than 260,000 People In Iowa Relied On SNAP</h3>
<p><strong>As Of November 2025, More Than 260,000 Iowans Relied On SNAP.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Des Moines Register, “‘The charitable food system cannot fill this gap,’ she said. ‘For every meal the charitable food system provides, SNAP provides nine.’&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal shutdown began on Oct. 1, hitting day 34 on Monday — one day short of the record-setting government closure in 2019. Because of the shutdown, full November SNAP benefits will not be issued to the more than 260,000 Iowans who rely on the program each month to help afford healthy food.” [Des Moines Register,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/11/04/randy-feenstra-food-bank-shutdown-snap-benefits/87064118007/">11/4/25]</a></p>
