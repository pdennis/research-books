# How To Win Against Brad Sherman

Brad Sherman built a record in Iowa of supporting policies that would have raised costs and reduced protections for working families, including supporting Medicaid and SNAP restrictions that made it harder for families to afford groceries. He downplayed the harm of Donald Trump’s tariffs even as they drove up food prices and cost Iowa farmers and small businesses tens of millions of dollars. Sherman floated tax proposals that would have shifted costs onto Iowa families through higher sales taxes. Sherman voted for a six-week abortion ban, founded an anti-abortion crisis pregnancy center, and aligned with anti-abortion organizations. Sherman also proudly touted his opposition to LGBTQ rights. He promoted election denial rhetoric that undermined trust in Iowa’s elections. Brad Sherman rejected the separation of church and state, advocated for greater religious influence over government, and used religious rhetoric to legitimize political power. Sherman dismissed established science on the harms of carbon pollution, promoted vaccine misinformation, attacked public health measures, and aligned with anti-vaccine organizations.
