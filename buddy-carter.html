<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>How To Win Against Buddy Carter</strong></h1>
<p>Buddy Carter is a swampy career MAGA politician who wants to gut Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security and blindly supports Trump’s moves to wreck the economy. Carter is corrupt, an election denier, and an anti-abortion extremist who puts himself and Donald Trump ahead of everyday Georgians. Carter ripped health care away from nearly half a million Georgians and stood by while Trump fired hardworking Atlantans and shuttered Georgia Social Security offices.</p>
<h3><strong>Carter Endangered Georgians’ Health Care</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Carter <a href="https://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=16052"><u>voted for a bill </u></a>that allowed the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium subsidies to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5653811-house-gop-health-care-bill/"><u>expire</u></a>. Carter previously <a href="https://youtu.be/1blEjLsHCjk"><u>mocked</u></a> the subsidies and <a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/story/news/local/2025/12/10/congress-vote-could-double-healthcare-premiums-for-1-million-georgians/87691433007/?tbref=hp"><u>opposed their extension</u></a>. An estimated <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/2025/09/report-georgia-health-sector-to-lose-37b-in-2026-as-aca-subsidies-end/"><u>460,000 Georgians</u></a> could lose their health insurance as a result of Carter’s vote and Georgians expected their health care premiums to <a href="https://roughdraftatlanta.com/2025/12/12/rising-aca-costs-georgia/"><u>more than double</u></a>.</li>
  <li>Carter <a href="https://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=15760"><u>authored</u></a> the GOP’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/"><u>massive medicaid cuts</u></a> under the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ and was disappointed he couldn’t “<a href="https://youtu.be/rgS2OQ3NTCQ"><u>cut Medicaid more</u></a>.” He <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/a84dcfc7-4ba1-43f4-8605-e4ad67108f53/s-1NCeqSKaJy5?si=6bc0d662b9e548f8af5770fad0212728&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>demanded work requirements</u></a> on Medicaid enrollees and his vote <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/2025/06/report-big-beautiful-bill-could-cost-georgia-rural-hospitals-540-million/"><u>threatened Georgia’s rural hospitals </u></a>with funding cuts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Message: </strong>Carter voted to rip away health care from thousands of Georgians to fund billionaire tax cuts.</p>
<h3><strong>Carter Stood By While Trump Attacked Social Security And Fired Hard-Working Georgians</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>In 2025, Carter <a href="https://x.com/RepBuddyCarter/status/1917209774904520789"><u>praised</u></a> Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” as DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive"><u>affecting</u></a> the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/"><u>federal government’s</u></a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/"><u>ability</u></a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/"><u>deliver services</u></a> to seniors. More than <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/ga.pdf"><u>1.56 million Georgians</u></a><u>&nbsp;</u> relied on Social Security benefits.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Carter wanted to “<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/dc370f04-a672-4790-838d-723b05f7cf4d/s-PRZUOrRUJyg?si=1840a1fdd8b64ef0943cccac1655ef58&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>attack</u></a>” social security and <a href="https://youtu.be/YUpmH8Bn2jE"><u>let Elon Musk ‘DOGE’ the SSA</u></a>. He <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/buddy-carter-the-martha-zoller-show-3182025/s-wuGRmmouWw2?si=2df6476f2d814df3a7dd2994c3c594da&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>stood by</u></a> while DOGE <a href="https://www.abc27.com/news/list-of-social-security-administration-offices-doge-is-closing/"><u>closed five of Georgia’s local SSA offices</u></a>.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Carter <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/3337016/republicans-encourage-more-doge-cuts/"><u>promoted DOGE</u></a> even though it resulted in <a href="https://pro.stateaffairs.com/ga/politics/georgia-doge-federal-cuts"><u>$815 million in federal funding cuts</u></a> to Georgia nonprofits and organizations. He <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/buddy-carter-politically-georgia-1262024/s-MMctAgford6?si=2121cfe915f443aea42426d2c075a7ab&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>downplayed</u></a> the federal layoffs and wanted federal workers to <a href="https://youtu.be/w1e1oH-rL3A"><u>prove they were efficient</u></a> while Trump fired over <a href="https://pro.stateaffairs.com/ga/politics/georgia-doge-federal-cuts"><u>2,300 CDC employees</u></a> in Atlanta.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Message: </strong>While Social Security lines grew and Georgia workers were laid off, Carter didn’t help them.</p>
<h3><strong>Carter Cheered For Trump’s Tariffs And Dismissed His Constituents’ Pain</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Carter minimized Georgians’ “<a href="https://youtu.be/VgYUAyTPHE8"><u>short term pain</u></a>” and claimed that “<a href="https://youtu.be/jbNbxubmXi8"><u>the long term gain for American workers, for American families, will far outweigh that</u></a>.” He <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/derek-dooley-fox-news-rundown-51325/s-jykH0Ci75Y0?si=d15dfcf2b31d41df80ba6fc4c811d7dc&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>wholly backed</u></a> Trump’s tariffs and told Georgians to “<a href="https://youtu.be/yqmg9CKBl6I"><u>hang in there and tolerate</u></a>” their <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/trumps-tariff-plan-sparks-economic-uncertainty-georgia"><u>economic suffering</u></a>. Tariffs slammed Georgians with <a href="https://atlantaciviccircle.org/2025/03/18/trump-tariffs-increase-housing-costs-atlanta/"><u>increased housing costs</u></a> and <a href="https://www.13wmaz.com/article/money/economy/grocery-store-prices-continue-climb-central-georgia-shoppers-feel-the-impacts/93-b1863f8a-bc7a-4365-95e1-ba934e11e8b0"><u>grocery bills</u></a> and <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/trumps-tariff-plan-sparks-economic-uncertainty-georgia"><u>constricted activity</u></a> at Georgia’s ports.</li>
  <li>Carter <a href="https://youtu.be/CdQLS_GAfa8"><u>defended Trump’s trade wars</u></a> with ally nations and declared that “<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/2120aa44-7dc6-4b03-a4de-7fb5b2093724/s-gDqrdrY9JhH?si=77adad30f3504c7c91575a077ab657a7&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>tariffs are the answer</u></a>” to supply chain insecurities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Message: </strong>Carter backed Trump’s tariffs and trade wars to crush Georgia small businesses and ensure Georgians will pay more for groceries and housing.</p>
<h3><strong>Carter Was An Anti-Abortion Extremist</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Buddy Carter was an out-of-touch anti-abortion extremist who <a href="https://x.com/RepBuddyCarter/status/1649569432069439488"><u>condemned the Supreme Court</u></a> for upholding abortion pill access and attempted to <a href="https://x.com/Buddy_Carter/status/1555588236692570114"><u>block</u></a> Planned Parenthood's federal funding. Carter previously led <a href="https://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=10837"><u>letters to the FDA</u></a>, calling on the administration to restrict abortion pill access, and proposed <a href="https://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=10583"><u>legislation</u></a> to codify pharmacists’ right <a href="https://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=10411"><u>to deny care to patients with abortion pill prescriptions</u></a>.</li>
  <li>Carter <a href="https://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=10367"><u>celebrated</u></a> the overturning of Roe v. Wade, <a href="https://x.com/RepBuddyCarter/status/1937588762403307905"><u>annually</u></a>, and in Congress, Carter <a href="https://x.com/RepBuddyCarter/status/1389207598126309380"><u>repeatedly</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/RepBuddyCarter/status/1382485289499770883"><u>backed</u></a> “<a href="https://x.com/RepBuddyCarter/status/1171534130884087808"><u>born-alive</u></a>” legislation and supported <a href="https://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2515"><u>a federal ban on abortions</u></a> “20 weeks or more after conception.”</li>
  <li>Carter <a href="https://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=10367"><u>supported</u></a> fetal personhood, claimed abortion was “<a href="https://x.com/RepBuddyCarter/status/1526586198613020672"><u>not health care</u></a>,” and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/12cbbbc0-4886-4e24-86ea-47a957708089/s-KXirsnyIey0?si=bae238bb10d14c31ba7b8986bfd51b5a&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>endorsed</u></a> Georgia’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/23/1139039767/georgia-supreme-court-reinstates-abortion-ban"><u>extreme</u></a> ‘heartbeat bill.’ He <a href="https://youtu.be/N1M37uUe8SY"><u>supported opt-outs</u></a> to allow medical professionals to refuse reproductive health care and <a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/14332"><u>voted</u></a> to require parental abortion notifications regarding minors.</li>
  <li>Carter claimed abortion was “<a href="https://x.com/RepBuddyCarter/status/1466091107704520706"><u>murder</u></a>,” that anti-abortion legislation “<a href="https://x.com/Buddy_Carter/status/1415689126469328901"><u>saved 2.5 million lives</u></a>,” and <a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/14303"><u>voted</u></a> to expand the definition of “feticide” to include any stage of pregnancy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Message:</strong> Carter threatened the reproductive freedoms of Georgians.</p>
<h3><strong>Carter Voted To Release The Epstein Files After 11 Months, Only Because Trump Finally Approved Of The Release</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>It took Carter 11 months to <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml"><u>vote</u></a> for the release of the Epstein files, only after <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/16/nx-s1-5610552/trump-house-republicans-epstein-files"><u>Trump</u></a> told House Republicans he approved of the release.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Carter touted his vote for the release of the Epstein files, defending Trump and claiming he supported transparency, but he never signed the <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209"><u>discharge petition</u></a>, never <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581/cosponsors?pageSort=alphaByParty"><u>co-sponsored the legislation</u></a>, and previously voted against the release of the files. In <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml"><u>July 2025</u></a>, Collins cast the deciding vote against <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj"><u>releasing the Epstein files</u></a>, protecting the accused pedophiles named within them.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Message:</strong> Despite previously voting against releasing the Epstein files, Carter ultimately voted for the release of the Epstein files only because Trump approved of the release.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Carter The Swamp Creature: Push Self-Advantageous Legislation And Cash Big Pharma Checks While Drowning Georgia Communities With Opioids</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>In 2016, Carter <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/congressman-pharmaceutical-interests-raise-questions/nEZSpjmhFCcqKMcSUj8OfN/"><u>sought an oversight position</u></a> on prescription drugs and pharmaceutical applications while he <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/congressman-pharmaceutical-interests-raise-questions/nEZSpjmhFCcqKMcSUj8OfN/"><u>maintained a $220,000 relationship</u></a> with Big Pharma insiders. Ethics watchdogs <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/congressman-pharmaceutical-interests-raise-questions/nEZSpjmhFCcqKMcSUj8OfN/"><u>slammed</u></a> Carter’s pursuit of the committee position as an attempt to enrich himself and his family. Carter also introduced <a href="https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/buddy-carter-faces-conflict-interest-questions-over-pharmacy-bills/cS6MRQq7C7V2F4WVWURLbO/"><u>legislation</u></a> to benefit his pharmacies; ethics watchdogs again called his attempts a “<a href="https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/buddy-carter-faces-conflict-interest-questions-over-pharmacy-bills/cS6MRQq7C7V2F4WVWURLbO/"><u>clear violation of the spirit</u></a>” of House ethics rules.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Carter was “<a href="https://thecurrentga.org/2022/10/31/carter-removed-from-wrongful-death-lawsuit-involving-savannah-opioid-overdose-victim/"><u>dogged by accusations that as a longtime pharmacist in Pooler, he and his company amassed a fortune from the sale of prescription opioids</u></a>” and he was a defendant in a five-year <a href="https://thecurrentga.org/2022/10/31/carter-removed-from-wrongful-death-lawsuit-involving-savannah-opioid-overdose-victim/"><u>lawsuit</u></a> connected to the opioid crisis. Carter’s pharmacies were awash with prescription painkillers and distributed nearly <a href="https://thecurrentga.org/2022/10/31/carter-removed-from-wrongful-death-lawsuit-involving-savannah-opioid-overdose-victim/"><u>3 million pills</u></a> from 2006 to 2014. The supplier of those pills, McKesson Corp. contributed <a href="https://thecurrentga.org/2022/10/31/carter-removed-from-wrongful-death-lawsuit-involving-savannah-opioid-overdose-victim/"><u>over $108,000</u></a> to Carter’s political campaigns during the same timeframe.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Message:</strong> Carter went to Washington more than a decade ago to further enrich himself when the Big Pharma checks and blood money from the opioid epidemic weren’t enough.</p>
