<h2><strong>Ernst Was An Anti-Abortion Extremist&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Ernst Opposed Abortion&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Ernst Claimed That Abortion Wasn’t Healthcare&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] Ernst Claimed That She Didn’t Believe That Abortion Was Healthcare For Women. </strong>“I’m one of the point people in the United States Senate that works on life issues because they are so important to me, but number one is safeguarding our tax payer dollars by redirecting them from Planned Parenthood to other eligible entities that provide women's health services. Not abortion. Because I'm so tired of the argument used by others that abortion is health care for women. I don't believe that. And I do think that there are entities like Guiding Star that are very worthy of the dollars when we are paying attention to the whole health of the woman.” [Guiding Star Siouxland Fundraiser, 03/07/25]; 250307_EGJ_1573_A</p>
<h4><strong><u>Ernst Celebrated The Dobbs Decision&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Ernst Claimed That The Dobbs Decision “Reflects The Science” And Would “Save Lives.” </strong>According to a press release from Senator Joni Ernst, “I’m proudly and adamantly pro-life. This decision reflects the science, will save lives, and rightly returns policymaking power back to the American people and their elected officials.” [Press Release – Senator Joni Ernst, <a href="https://www.ernst.senate.gov/news/press-releases/ernst-on-scotus-decision-in-dobbs-case"><u>6/24/22</u></a>]&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ernst Celebrated The Dobbs Decision And Introduced A Resolution Congratulating The Pro-Life Movement. </strong>According to a press release from Senator Joni Ernst, “After the decision by the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade last week, a historic milestone in the pro-life movement, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) joined her colleagues, led by Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), in recognizing and celebrating the pro-life movement and volunteers in their role to support mothers and children over the last 50 years. This week, the senators introduced a resolution congratulating the pro-life movement on its historic victory in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.” [Press Release – Senator Joni Ernst, <a href="https://www.ernst.senate.gov/news/press-releases/after-major-pro-life-victory-ernst-colleagues-celebrate-pro-life-movement-and-volunteers"><u>6/28/22</u></a>]</p>
<h3><strong>Ernst Supported Anti-Abortion Policies&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Ernst Supported A 20-Week Abortion Ban&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2015: Ernst Effectively Voted To Prohibit Abortions After 20-Weeks Gestation Except In Cases Of Rape Or Incest, But Would Also Require Rape Victims To Document That They Received Prior Medical Treatment Or Counseling.</strong> In September 2015, Ernst effectively voted for a bill that would prohibit abortions after 20 weeks of gestation and would impose criminal penalties on doctors that violated the ban. According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill would, “prohibit abortions in cases where the probable age of the fetus is 20 weeks or later, except in cases of rape, incest against a minor or when the life of the pregnant woman is in danger. Specifically, it would provide an exemption for pregnancies that are the result of rape against adult women if the woman obtained counseling or medical treatment for the rape at least 48 hours before the abortion. Pregnancies resulting from rape or incest against a minor would also be exempt from the ban if the rape or incest had been reported before the abortion to law enforcement or another government agency authorized to act on reports of child abuse. The measure would impose criminal penalties on doctors who violate the ban. The measure also would require health care practitioners to give the same level of care to an infant born alive during a failed abortion as they would give to an infant born at the same gestational age through natural birth.” The vote was on cloture and the Senate rejected the bill 54 to 42; 60 Senators voting yes would have been required to invoke cloture. The House had earlier passed the bill. [Senate Vote 268, <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00268"><u>9/22/15</u></a>; Congressional Quarterly, <a href="http://www.cq.com/vote/2015/S/268?4"><u>9/22/15</u></a>; Congressional Actions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/36/all-actions"><u>H.R. 36</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bill Would Sentence Doctors To Up To Five Years In Jail For Violating The Ban. According to Congressional Quarterly, “The bill imposes criminal penalties on physicians who violate the ban, with violations subject to a maximum five-year jail sentence, fines or both. It prohibits the prosecution of the woman obtaining the abortion, however, either as the perpetrator or as a conspirator to violate the ban.” [Congressional Quarterly, </strong><a href="http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4681207/3?7&amp;search=CPUgz1bX"><strong><u>5/12/15</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Obama White House: Bill “Is An Assault On A Woman’s Right To Choose.” According to a Statement of Administration Policy, “The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 36, which would unacceptably restrict women’s health and reproductive rights and is an assault on a woman's right to choose. Women should be able to make their own choices about their bodies and their health care, and Government should not inject itself into decisions best made between a woman and her doctor. […] If the President were presented with this legislation, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto this bill.” [White House, Statement of Administration Policy, </strong><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/114/saphr36r_20150120.pdf"><strong><u>1/20/15</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Opponents Of The Bill Said The Exceptions For Health Of The Mother Were Inadequate. According to Congressional Quarterly, “They also say the bill lacks adequate health exceptions for the mother, as a doctor would have to wait until a condition was life-threatening before performing an abortion. Serious but non-life-threatening conditions couldn’t be treated under this ban, they say, which could result in permanent health issues such as infertility.” [Congressional Quarterly, </strong><a href="http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4681207/3?7&amp;search=CPUgz1bX"><strong><u>5/12/15</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Bill Created Barriers For Exceptions In The Case Of Rape Or Incest. According to Congressional Quarterly, “And while the original bill’s rape and incest provisions were onerous, they say the new language erects new barriers, including requiring rape victims to document that they received prior medical treatment or counseling, and that a second doctor be present for the abortion.” [Congressional Quarterly, </strong><a href="http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4681207/3?7&amp;search=CPUgz1bX"><strong><u>5/12/15</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ernst Argued For A National 20-Week Abortion Ban, Citing The Case Of An Iowa Child Born At 22 Weeks And Survived. </strong>According to the Guardian, “A little over a year later, Ernst argued for a national 20-week abortion ban, specifically citing babies such as Micah Pickering, an Iowa child who was born at 22 weeks' gestation and survived. ‘It is time we listened to the scientific evidence,’ Ernst told the US Senate in January 2018. She argued for a national 20-week ban using the ‘the inspiring stories of’ babies like Pickering, which ‘show they survive outside the womb’. The Pickering's story was picked up by Ernst in 2015, after the family was flown to Washington DC by the anti-abortion Susan B Anthony List.” [Guardian, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/13/how-anti-abortion-activists-use-cutting-edge-science-to-justify-ever-stricter-laws"><u>7/13/18</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Ernst Supported A 6 Week Abortion Ban&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Ernst Called Iowa’s Six Week Abortion Ban An “Important Step Forward.” </strong>According to Politico, “Ernst, who is up for reelection in 2020 and was once considered a potential running mate for President Donald Trump, is a staunch conservative who has authored legislation defunding Planned Parenthood and who praised her home state’s abortion ban as an ‘important step forward.’ Iowa’s ban is among the strictest in the country but a court has put it on hold.” [Politico, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/02/blackburn-ernst-become-first-gop-women-to-serve-on-senate-judiciary-1033118"><u>1/2/19</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Iowa’s Abortion Law Banned Most Abortions After A Fetal Heartbeat Was Detected, Which Usually Happened Around Six Weeks Of Gestation. </strong>According to Des Moines Register, “Gov. Kim Reynolds said Monday that she will not appeal a ruling that struck down a state law that banned most abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected. […] The law would have barred most abortions after a fetal heartbeat could be detected. Critics said that happens around six weeks of gestation, before many women realize they’re pregnant. But the measure was placed on hold during the legal fight and never took effect.” [Des Moines Register, <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/18/abortion-law-court-governor-fetal-heartbeat-ruling-kim-reynolds-planned-parenthood-decision-iowa/2910822002/"><u>2/18/19</u></a>]</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><u>Ernst Supported A Personhood Amendment&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2013: Ernst Co-Sponsored A So-Called Personhood Amendment To Iowa Constitution. </strong>In April 2010, Ernst co-sponsored a joint resolution that proposed “an amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa relating to the inalienable right to life.” The motion was referred to the Senate Rules &amp; Administration Committee. No further action was taken. [Senate Joint Resolution 10, <a href="http://coolice.legis.iowa.gov/Cool-ICE/default.asp?Category=BillInfo&amp;Service=Billbook&amp;ga=85&amp;hbill=SJR10"><u>4/29/13</u></a>; Journal of the Senate, <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/pubs/sjweb/pdf/April%2029,%202013.pdf#page=12"><u>4/29/13</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Resolution Would Have Recognized And Protected The Right To Life At “Any Stage Of Development.” </strong>According to the text of the resolution, “The inalienable right to life of every person at any stage of development shall be recognized and protected.” [Senate Joint Resolution 10, <a href="http://coolice.legis.iowa.gov/Cool-ICE/default.asp?Category=BillInfo&amp;Service=Billbook&amp;ga=85&amp;hbill=SJR10"><u>4/29/13</u></a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Resolution Would Have Put A Personhood Amendment Up To A Referendum. </strong>According to the text of the resolution, “The foregoing proposed amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred to the general assembly to be chosen at the next general election for members of the general assembly and the secretary of state is directed to cause the proposed amendment to be published for three consecutive months previous to the date of that election as provided by law.” [Senate Joint Resolution 10, <a href="http://coolice.legis.iowa.gov/Cool-ICE/default.asp?Category=BillInfo&amp;Service=Billbook&amp;ga=85&amp;hbill=SJR10"><u>4/29/13</u></a>]</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><u>Ernst Joined A Letter Calling On Trump To Reinstate Pro-Life Policies&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Ernst Signed A Letter Calling On Trump To Reinstate Pro-Life Policies. </strong>According to a press release from Senator Katie Britt, “In addition to Senators Britt, Hyde-Smith, and Lankford, the letter was signed by U.S. Senators Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Jim Banks (R-Ind.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-Kan.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).” [Press Release – Senator Katie Britt, <a href="https://www.britt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/u-s-senators-katie-britt-cindy-hyde-smith-encourage-president-trump-to-reinstate-life-affirming-policies/"><u>1/23/25</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>The Letter Claimed That The Senators Were Looking Forward To Trump Reinstating Policies On Life. </strong>According to a press release from Senator Katie Britt, “‘Over the last four years, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and their administration systematically weaponized the government against the unborn, their mothers and pro-life Americans—doing their very best to erase every trace of life-affirming victories from your first administration,’ the lawmakers wrote.&nbsp; ‘We look forward to the reinstatement of Trump policies on life in the first days of your second term, getting the country back to a life-affirming, whole of government approach to supporting pregnant and parenting women and their children, born and unborn.’” [Press Release – Senator Katie Britt, <a href="https://www.britt.senate.gov/news/press-releases/u-s-senators-katie-britt-cindy-hyde-smith-encourage-president-trump-to-reinstate-life-affirming-policies/"><u>1/23/25</u></a>]</p>

<h3><strong>Ernst Supported Collecting Abortion Data Which Inlcuded Sensitive Information&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Ernst Introduced The ‘‘Ensuring Accurate and Complete Abortion Data Reporting Act of 2025” Which Would Require States To Report Abortion Data&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Ernst Introduced The ‘‘Ensuring Accurate and Complete Abortion Data Reporting Act of 2025” Which Would Require States To Report The Amount Of Abortions That Are Performed. </strong>According to the Daily Signal, “Sen. Joni Ernst is introducing a bill Wednesday to require states to accurately report abortion data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. States are currently asked but not required to provide this information to the CDC. &nbsp; If passed and signed into law, the bill, titled the ‘Ensuring Accurate and Complete Abortion Data Reporting Act of 2025,’ will require states to report the number of abortions performed each year. States that fail to provide the CDC with the requested abortion data will risk losing Medicaid payments for certain family planning services and supplies.” [Daily Signal, <a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/01/22/exclusive-new-bill-would-require-states-to-be-transparent-about-annual-number-of-abortions/"><u>1/22/25</u></a>]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Bill Would Require States To Collect Race, Age, Ethnicity, Marital Status, And County Of Residence Of Women Who Have An Abortion. </strong>According to the Daily Signal, “In addition to proving the number of abortions performed annually, the bill requires each state to collect information regarding the age, race, ethnicity, marital status, and county of residence of the women having the abortion. The gestational age of the baby at the time of the abortion, the abortion method used to terminate the pregnancy, and whether the child survived the abortion is also required information for state documentation.” [Daily Signal, <a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/01/22/exclusive-new-bill-would-require-states-to-be-transparent-about-annual-number-of-abortions/"><u>1/22/25</u></a>]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] Ernst Claimed That She Supported Having The Number Of Abortions Be Reported To The CDC. </strong>“I'm also working to require all 50 states to report accurate numbers of abortions performed to the CDC. Why is this important? Because not all states report their abortion numbers to the CDC, which means when you have those that are pro abortion out there touting statistics, they can actually downplay the number of abortions that are performed in the United States every year. We want truth and accuracy and transparency in reporting.” [Guiding Star Siouxland Fundraiser, 03/07/25]; 250307_EGJ_1573_B</p>
