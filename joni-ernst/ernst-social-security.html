<p><strong>[VIDEO] Ernst Claimed That She Has Looked At Privatizing Social Security As An Option. </strong>“So first yes I have talked about privatizing Social Security as an option.” [Wesley Acres Retirement, 9/3/14]</p>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Ernst: “We Do Have To Reform Medicare, Medicaid, And Social Security And The Way We Do That With Social Security Is By Looking At Transitioning Our Younger Workers On To Individual Plans Or Individual Savings Accounts…The Way We Are Protecting Our Seniors Is By Transitioning Our Younger Workers.” </strong>According to a debate held by KCCI, Ernst said, “I do think we have to keep the promises that are made to today's seniors. Absolutely. So what to do this. We do have to reform Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security and the way we do that with Social Security is by looking at transitioning our younger workers on to individual plans or individual savings accounts whether that's tied to the market whether it's based on interest rates however we want to do that we can have that discussion but the way we are protecting our seniors is by transitioning our younger workers and we can do that.” [KCCI, 5/28/14]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Ernst Claimed That Discussions About Social Security Should Happen Behind Closed Doors To Avoid Accountability From American Voters</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Ernst Claimed That Discussions About Social Security Should Happen Behind Closed Doors. </strong>According to Iowa Starting Line, “‘So, it’s a broader discussion for another day,’ she continued, ‘but I do think as various parties and members of Congress, we do need to sit down behind closed doors so we’re not being scrutinized by this group or the other, and just have an open and honest conversation about what are some of the ideas that we have for maintaining Social Security in the future.’” [Iowa Starting Line, <a href="https://iowastartingline.com/2019/09/04/ernst-need-to-sit-down-behind-closed-doors-for-social-security-fix/"><u>9/4/19</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Ernst Supported Raiding The Social Security Fund To Pay For Other Things&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Ernst’s Paid Family Leave Proposal Would Allow New Parents To Draw From Future Social Security Benefits To Finance Leave. </strong>According to Roll Call, “A proposal by Lee and Ernst, and another by Wagner, would be similar to a plan put forth by Sen. Marco Rubio last Congress, which would allow new parents to draw from future Social Security benefits to finance their leave. Cassidy’s office did not provide details of his plan. ‘The president has made it clear that paid family leave is a priority for his administration, that’s why I am all the more encouraged to continue working with my colleagues, and the administration, to create a path forward for a budget-neutral, child-focused paid leave program rather than impose a new entitlement or mandate,’ Ernst said in a statement.” [Roll Call, <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/republicans-seeing-opportunities-suburbs-advance-paid-leave"><u>3/4/19</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Nebraska Senator Deb Fischer Described Ernst’s Paid Family Leave Plan As “Raiding” Social Security. </strong>According to Omaha World-Herald, “Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., authored her own paid leave pilot program that was included in the GOP tax overhaul. That program would provide tax credits to employers who offer paid family leave. Fischer said she worked closely with AARP on her own program and described Ernst’s bill as ‘raiding’ Social Security. ‘I have no desire to raid Social Security,’ Fischer said. She also characterized her approach as more comprehensive than Ernst’s because it covers not just new parents but those who need time off to care for a sick child or an ailing parent.” [Omaha World-Herald, <a href="https://www.omaha.com/news/nation/morton/ernst-proposal-would-give-new-parents-paid-leave-benefits-delay/article_9865531d-23be-5903-973c-73f9b3aac44e.html"><u>3/13/19</u></a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Ernst’s Plan Was Described As Potentially Worsening The Social Security Deficit. </strong>According to Vox, “The plan also doesn’t take into account the fact that the future of Social Security is in jeopardy. The system is running a deficit for the first time in more than 30 years, and the Social Security administration expects that it will run out of money to pay workers their full retirement benefits by 2035. Because working parents won’t be paying back the borrowed money until they retire decades from now, allowing workers to take more money from the system will only make the problem worse. Ernst and Lee say the Cradle Act addresses this problem. Under the bill, lawmakers would transfer money each year from the government’s General Fund to replenish whatever parents borrowed from the Social Security Trust Fund. But it’s hard to see how this wouldn’t add to the deficit, as they claim, because there’s not a lot of unused money sitting around in the General Fund. If parents (hypothetically) borrow $2 billion in one year, that means Congress will need to find a way to pay for it, assuming lawmakers are serious about protecting Social Security.” [Vox, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/13/18263790/paid-family-leave-bill-cradle-act"><u>3/13/19</u></a>]</li>
