# How To Win Against Jon Husted 

In his short time as Senator, Husted has championed policies that have hurt Ohio families, damaged Ohio’s economy and set America back. Husted voted for legislation that was set to kick Ohioans off their healthcare, ripped food assistance from families and slashed energy credits which was supporting Ohio’s economy. On top of voting for the legislation, he was advocating for deeper cuts. Instead of protecting Ohioan’s healthcare, he allowed necessary subsidies to expire which was set to spike Ohio families insurance premiums. Despite Ohio voting to protect abortion access, Husted continued to attack women’s rights and even started undermining safe medication like mifepristone. To make matters worse, Husted was caught up in Ohio’s largest corruption scandal. Husted helped push through legislation that provided a bailout to FirstEnergy who were bribing officials. Husted seemed more interested in standing up for the DC swamp and corporations than the hard working citizens of Ohio. 

### Husted Voted For Devastating Health Care Cuts 

Husted betrayed Ohioans by [voting](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1191/vote_119_1_00372.htm) for a bill that is estimated to kick [17 million](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) American off their health insurance, including nearly [12 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) who rely on Medicaid. Despite [claiming](https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/trump-big-beautiful-bill-husted-coshocton-steel-facility-ohio-tax-cuts-jobs-medicaid-reform-hydrogen-technology-cleveland-cliffs) that the bill wouldn’t cut anyone's benefits and that it was a [“pro-family”](https://signalakron.org/senator-jon-husted-discusses-health-care-medicare-medicaid-immigration-at-akron-roundtable/) bill, over [340,000](https://signalohio.org/under-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-ohio-to-lose-33-billion-for-medicaid-340000-to-lose-insurance-analysts-say/) Ohioans could lose their health insurance as a result of his vote. If it was up to Husted than the cuts would’ve been [deeper](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/first1/s-bxxfEu0hnfk?si=836e9b3c70904df0baeebb0bffe7ecac&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing).

Husted called ACA subsidies a “[pandemic failure](https://heartlandsignal.com/2025/11/19/months-of-opposition-ignored-husted-performs-u-turn-on-aca-tax-credit-extension/).” Without extending the ACA subsidies, Ohioans could face a [83 Percent](https://tiffinohio.net/posts/ohio-families-hit-with-soaring-health-costs-under-jon-husted-s-failed-health-care-agenda/) jump in premiums and [107,000](https://tiffinohio.net/posts/ohio-families-hit-with-soaring-health-costs-under-jon-husted-s-failed-health-care-agenda/) Ohioans could lose coverage.

Husted [voted](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1191/vote_119_1_00372.htm) for a bill that made the [largest SNAP cut](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-senate-republican-leaderships-reconciliation-bill-takes) in history. [Around 1.4 Million](https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/snap-state-factsheet-oh.pdf) Ohioans rely on SNAP to afford groceries.

Husted claimed that the tariffs “[haven’t affected the economy negatively](https://youtu.be/D3Bnwb4Lx5M?si=4CCgZqA14diVPZwv)” despite evidence showed otherwise. 

Trump’s tariffs have [harmed](https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/ohio-soybean-farmers-feeling-impact-of-tariffs/530-0a32ba54-772a-4a8e-ac5e-202496b83f19) Ohio [farmers](https://tiffinohio.net/posts/ohio-farmers-say-husted-s-tariffs-are-crushing-their-bottom-line/) and impacted Ohio’s [manufacturing](https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/local/2025/10/15/grove-city-manufacturer-tosoh-smd-lost-millions-to-tariffs-this-year/86625920007/). Instead of standing up for Ohio’s families, Husted [voted](https://www.daytondailynews.com/local/ohio-senators-husted-moreno-defend-trump-tariffs-as-some-republicans-defect/AUY5T5W2NNAXVJEABQG6SKQ7IU/) to protect the damaging tariffs.

### Husted Voted Against Protecting Ohioans’ Clean Energy Jobs 

Husted [voted](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1191/vote_119_1_00372.htm) to repeal clean energy tax credits that supported Ohio’s economy and created jobs. Husted, while touting the bill containing clean energy cuts, posted a photo where he was [laughing](https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/07/15/ohio-us-sen-husted-takes-down-post-of-him-laughing-with-lobbyists-bragging-about-trumps-bill/) with energy lobbyists.

Husted [supported](https://meidasnews.com/news/jon-husteds-extremist-record-on-abortion-rights-is-out-of-touch-with-ohio) Ohio’s heartbeat bill that lacked exceptions.

The scandal, which [dragged down](https://www.cleveland.com/news/2025/10/ex-ohio-gop-chair-matt-borges-convicted-of-role-in-hb6-scandal-leaves-prison-early.html) several Republican leaders in Ohio, centered on FirstEnergy which bribed elected officials to support legislation. FirstEnergy funneled [$1 million](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2024/04/firstenergy-made-secret-1-million-payment-for-husted-campaign-in-2017-documents-show.html) to Husted’s failed gubernatorial campaign.
