<h2>Husted Voted For Devastating Health Care Cuts&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>Husted Voted For The One Big Beautiful Bill&nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>2025: Husted Voted For Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025, Husted voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill, as amended, that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 50 to 50 with Vice President Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Bill Would Reduce Medicaid And Children’s Health Insurance Program Funding By $1 Trillion And Remove 10.5 Million People From The Programs By 2034.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Center For American Progress, “The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the OBBBA will cut federal spending on Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) benefits by $1.02 trillion, due in part to eliminating at least 10.5 million people from the programs by 2034.” [Center For American Progress,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-truth-about-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-acts-cuts-to-medicaid-and-medicare/">7/3/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Bill Established A Medicaid Work Requirement That Would Effectively Cause Eligible People To Lose Coverage Due To Burdensome Paperwork. </strong>According to the Center For American Progress, “Indeed, only 8 percent of recipients between the ages of 19 and 64 who weren’t on SSI or SSDI in 2023 ‘[weren’t] working due to retirement, inability to find work, or other reason[s].’ Those who were not working were statistically more likely to be older women who left the workforce to care for aging parents or children. The OBBBA requires individuals to prove that they are working, engaging in community service, or receiving work training for at least 80 hours per month—or that they are enrolled in school part time—unless they qualify for an exemption. Medicaid enrollees who are trying to find a job, are having difficulty finding employment, or who lack reliable transportation to work would be penalized under this requirement. That includes at least more than 2.6 million adults with disabilities who don’t have SSI or SSDI and have difficulty working due to disability or illness. Research indicates that paperwork requirements such as those in the bill—particularly for Medicaid—don’t increase employment rates and often increase overhead costs. A group of researchers evaluated the first year of paperwork reporting requirements in Arkansas and found that there was a significant loss of Medicaid coverage in the initial six months among eligible people and no significant change in employment.” [Center For American Progress,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-truth-about-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-acts-cuts-to-medicaid-and-medicare/">7/3/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Bill Could Leave Up To 16 Billion People Uninsured, With The Disabled And Other Vulnerable Populations Facing The Brunt Of The Impact.</strong> According to the Center For American Progress, “Approximately 16 million people could end up uninsured due to the OBBBA, causing massive disruptions in health care. Congress is making historic cuts to essential services to give tax cuts to the wealthy. And disabled people and other vulnerable communities will likely bear the greatest burden.” [Center For American Progress,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-truth-about-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-acts-cuts-to-medicaid-and-medicare/">7/3/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Bill’s $50 Billion In Rural Hospital Relief Funding Would Not Come Close To The Gap Created By Medicaid Cuts, With 300 Rural Hospital At “Immediate Risk” Of Closure.</strong> According to the Center For American Progress, “The OBBBA includes $50 billion in relief funding for rural hospitals over a five-year period to help reduce the disastrous impacts of the bill’s roughly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts. As of May 2025, there were approximately 2,086 rural hospitals receiving $12.2 billion a year in net revenue from Medicaid. At the median, rural hospitals’ revenue from Medicaid is $3.9 million a year.Rural hospitals have some of the lowest operating margins in the nation, especially compared with urban hospitals, meaning that any reductions in revenue could lead to closures. The average operating margin for rural hospitals was 3.1 percent in 2023, with 44 percent of rural hospitals operating with negative margins. As a result, more than 300 rural hospitals are currently at ‘immediate risk’ of closure, especially now that the OBBBA is projected to cut Medicaid spending by $1.02 trillion. The relief fund designed to blunt the negative impacts caused by the bill would not come close to filling that gap. If every rural hospital in the country received an even share of the $50 billion in relief support, it would amount to only $4.5 million every year for five years. At the close of those five years, that funding would disappear altogether.” [Center For American Progress, <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-truth-about-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-acts-cuts-to-medicaid-and-medicare/">7/3/25</a>]</li>

<h4>Husted Supported The One Big Beautiful Bill&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>Husted Claimed That The Bill Would “Make America Safer, Stronger, And More Prosperous.”&nbsp;</strong>According to a press release from Senator Jon Husted, “Today is good news for Ohioans who want to keep more of the money they earn, have access to good jobs, run successful small businesses, live in communities that are protected by a secure border and see America reassert itself as the most confident nation with the strongest military in the world. This bill will make America safer, stronger and more prosperous.” [Press Release – Senator Jon Husted, <a href="https://www.husted.senate.gov/press-releases/husted-statement-on-increasing-tax-cuts-for-working-ohioans-making-americans-safer-and-more-prosperous/">7/1/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>Husted Claimed That The “One Big Beautiful Bill” Was The “Most Pro-Family, Working-Class Bill OF The 21<sup>st</sup> Century.”&nbsp;</strong>According to Signal Akron, “‘If we want to do ‘Made in America,’ we have to encourage people to invest, do research and development, and do manufacturing here,’ he said. ‘I think it’s the most pro-family, working-class bill of the 21st century because it eliminates tax on tips, eliminates tax on overtime and provides a $2,200 per-child tax credit.’” [Signal Akron, <a href="https://signalakron.org/senator-jon-husted-discusses-health-care-medicare-medicaid-immigration-at-akron-roundtable/">8/15/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] Husted Claimed That The OBBB Didn’t Cut The Deficit “Nearly Enough.”&nbsp;</strong>“Well, in the One Big Beautiful Bill that actually cut the deficit. You look at it, it cut the deficit not by nearly enough, but it cuts the deficit. And by the way, what we're talking about now,” [Strictly Speaking with Bob Frantz, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/first1/s-bxxfEu0hnfk?si=836e9b3c70904df0baeebb0bffe7ecac&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">10/02/25</a>]</p>
<h4>Husted Defended Medicaid Cuts In The One Big Beautiful Bill</h4>
<p><strong>Husted Claimed That Medicaid Reform Would Reduce Costs In The Long Run.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Washington Examiner, “‘The growth is necessary. If you really want to crash the debt, slow the economy down, and that’s what you’ll have problems with,’ Husted said. ‘And this reforms things like Medicaid, saying that if you’re a healthy adult who doesn’t have young children and you’re receiving these generous tax benefits, well, you know what? You’re going to have to work in return for those benefits now. Illegals who are here taking Medicaid, you’re not going to get those benefits anymore. All of those things help reduce costs in the long run and help reduce the deficit.’” [Washington Examiner, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/3457461/jon-husted-big-beautiful-bill-defends-promise-growth/">6/29/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>Husted Claimed That The Bill Wouldn’t Cut People’s Benefits and Would Instead Preserve People’s Benefits.&nbsp;</strong>According to ABC 6, “‘We hope more people will go to work and not be on government benefits, but be on private insurance,’ he said. ‘We hope that will create some savings. It is also no longer going to fund higher rates for illegal immigrants who are getting into this country, who are not citizens, who are taking more and more of the share of the Medicaid dollars that we spend. That's where any cost savings we're going to get are largely going to come from. But it's not by cutting benefits off anyone. That's not the case. We are preserving benefits for people through this bill. But we have to address the cost; we have to get to this, and everybody needs to be at the table to help.’” [ABC 6, <a href="https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/trump-big-beautiful-bill-husted-coshocton-steel-facility-ohio-tax-cuts-jobs-medicaid-reform-hydrogen-technology-cleveland-cliffs">7/2/25</a>]</p>

<p><strong>17 Million Americans Could Result Lose Their Health Coverage As A Result Of The “One Big Beautiful Bill.”&nbsp;</strong>According to the Washington Post, “&nbsp;The Senate version of President Donald Trump’s massive tax and immigration spending plan would wipe out many of the strides made by the Affordable Care Act in reducing the number of uninsured Americans, resulting in at least 17 million Americans losing their health coverage, according to nonpartisan estimates and experts.” [Washington Post,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/">7/1/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>The One Big Beautiful Bill Was Expected To Slash $33 Billion In Federal Medicaid Funds Earmarked For Ohio.&nbsp;</strong>According to Signal Ohio, “The Trump administration’s signature health care package is projected to slash $33 billion over the coming decade in federal funds otherwise earmarked for Ohio’s Medicaid program, according to new estimates. That’s a 13% cut against the current spending baseline for Medicaid, the publicly funded health insurance program for the poor and disabled.” [Signal Ohio, <a href="https://signalohio.org/under-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-ohio-to-lose-33-billion-for-medicaid-340000-to-lose-insurance-analysts-say/">10/15/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>The One Big Beautiful Bill Was Expected To Kick 340,000 Ohioans From Medicaid.&nbsp;</strong>According to Signal Ohio, “&nbsp;This sweeping spending bill is expected to purge 340,000 Ohioans from Medicaid, which covers more than 3 million residents in the state, and public health exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. That’s according to Jennifer Tolbert, director of state health policy and data for KFF, a health policy research organization, who spoke at a panel event last Thursday hosted by the Health Policy Institute of Ohio. ‘Of those, 290,000 will lose coverage because of the Medicaid changes,’ Tolbert said.” [Signal Ohio, <a href="https://signalohio.org/under-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-ohio-to-lose-33-billion-for-medicaid-340000-to-lose-insurance-analysts-say/">10/15/25</a>]</p>
