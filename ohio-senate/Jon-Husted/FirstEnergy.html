The owner of two nuclear power plants in northern Ohio wanted a $1 billion bailout to keep its plants running. A Republican lawmaker hoping to make a comeback wanted help returning to power. The result, federal investigators say, was a nearly $61 million bribery scheme to elect Perry County Rep. Larry Householder to lead the Ohio House of Representatives, pass House Bill 6 to subsidize the nuclear plants and defend that law against a ballot initiative to block it.” [Enquirer, <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/in-depth/news/politics/2021/06/03/ohio-corruption-house-bill-6-bribery-timeline-larry-householder/5248218001/">6/3/21</a>]</p>

<h3>FirstEnergy Made A Secret $1 Million Payment To Husted’s Failed Gubernatorial Campaign&nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>Headline: FirstEnergy Made Secret $1 Million Payment For ‘Husted Campaign’ In 2017, Documents Show&nbsp;</strong>[Cleveland.Com, <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2024/04/firstenergy-made-secret-1-million-payment-for-husted-campaign-in-2017-documents-show.html">4/10/24</a>]</p>
<p><strong>FirstEnergy, On The Onset Of The FirstEnergy Scandal, Donated $1 Million In “Dark Money” To Freedom Frontier Which Was Meant For Husted’s Campaign.&nbsp;</strong>According to Cleveland.Com, “FirstEnergy Corp., at the onset of what would become one of the biggest public corruption schemes in state history, gave a $1 million ‘dark money’ contribution to a nonprofit backing Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, new records show. The contribution, which has not previously been reported, came from the company in 2017 to Freedom Frontier, a political 501(c)(4) nonprofit that can accept unlimited funds from corporations without disclosing the source. FirstEnergy’s internal records classify the payment as for the “Husted campaign.” In 2017, Husted was a top contender for the Republican nomination to become Ohio governor before he agreed to the join the ticket of now-Gov. Mike DeWine.” [Cleveland.Com, <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2024/04/firstenergy-made-secret-1-million-payment-for-husted-campaign-in-2017-documents-show.html">4/10/24</a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Freedom Frontier Gave More Than $1 Million To “Ohio Conservatives For A Change” Which Was A PAC Backing Husted's Campaign. </strong>According to Cleveland.Com, “A review of the Freedom Frontier payment is instructive. Freedom Frontier in its 2017 tax return wasn’t required to disclose who provided its $2.2 million in contributions. During the 2017-2018 election cycle, Freedom Frontier gave more than $1 million to ‘Ohio Conservatives for a Change,’ a federal super PAC backing Husted’s campaign.” [Cleveland.Com, <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2024/04/firstenergy-made-secret-1-million-payment-for-husted-campaign-in-2017-documents-show.html">4/10/24</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Payment Was Revealed During The Deposition Of A FirstEnergy Executive Testifying.&nbsp;</strong>According to Cleveland.Com, “&nbsp;The seven-figure payment was revealed in the 2022 deposition of a FirstEnergy executive testifying in a lawsuit brought by shareholders. The shareholder lawsuit is one of several legal tentacles growing out of a bribery scandal that sent a former Ohio House speaker to prison and resulted in the indictments of the state’s former top utility regulator. Joseph Storsin, a company vice president, testified on FirstEnergy’s behalf.” [Cleveland.Com, <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2024/04/firstenergy-made-secret-1-million-payment-for-husted-campaign-in-2017-documents-show.html">4/10/24</a>]</p>

In short, FirstEnergy wanted subsidies for 10 years for their nuclear plants, while the Senate leaned towards six. ‘Just had long convo with JHusted just now. Senate President called John twice during our two calls and he called me back twice. All is well. JH is working on the 10 years,’ Dowling texted Jones in early July 2019. ‘He’s afraid it’s going to end up being 8. Talk later.’ ‘Matt needs to close the 10 with Larry and you or him with JH,’ Jones responded.” [Ohio Capital Journal, <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/06/24/new-texts-allegedly-show-ohio-lt-gov-jon-husted-leading-firstenergys-push-for-house-bill-6/">6/24/24</a>]</li>
