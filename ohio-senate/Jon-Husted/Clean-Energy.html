<h2>Husted Voted Against Protecting Ohioans’ Clean Energy Jobs</h2>
<h3>Husted Voted For The One Big Beautiful Bill Which Slashed Clean Energy Credits&nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>2025: Husted Voted For Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025, Husted voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill, as amended, that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 50 to 50 with Vice President Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.

<p><strong>Husted Claimed That The Bill Would “Make America Safer, Stronger, And More Prosperous.”&nbsp;</strong>According to a press release from Senator Jon Husted, “Today is good news for Ohioans who want to keep more of the money they earn, have access to good jobs, run successful small businesses, live in communities that are protected by a secure border and see America reassert itself as the most confident nation with the strongest military in the world. This bill will make America safer, stronger and more prosperous.” [Press Release – Senator Jon Husted, <a href="https://www.husted.senate.gov/press-releases/husted-statement-on-increasing-tax-cuts-for-working-ohioans-making-americans-safer-and-more-prosperous/">7/1/25</a>]</p>
<h4>The ”One Big Beautiful Bill” Slashed Clean Energy Credits</h4>
<p><strong>The Bill Accelerated The Phase Out Of Clean Energy Tax Credits And Required Construction Of Non-Nuclear Energy To Start Within 60 Days Of The Bill’s Signing To Claim A Tax Credit.</strong> According to CNN, “In last-minute changes, Republicans sped up the timelines for phasing out key clean energy tax credits to the end of 2028. They also put in a new, narrow set of requirements for energy companies building solar, wind, battery or geothermal to generate electricity, only allowing companies to recoup the credit if they started construction within a 60-day window after the bill was signed into law, and their power was in service by the end of 2028.” [CNN, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/what-is-in-trump-tax-spending-cuts-package">5/28/25</a>]</p>
