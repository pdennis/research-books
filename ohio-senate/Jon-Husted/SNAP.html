<h3>Husted Voted For The One Big Beautiful Bill Which Cut SNAP&nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>2025: Husted Voted For Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025, Husted voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill, as amended, that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 50 to 50 with Vice President Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.

  <li><strong>22.3 Million Families Would Lose Some Or All Of Their SNAP Benefits, With 5.3 Million Families Losing Over $25 In Benefits A Month And Of Those Families, The Average Loss In Benefits Would Be $146.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Urban Institute, “Our preliminary estimates of the SNAP policies in the Senate bill show the following: 22.3 million US families would be affected, losing some or all of their SNAP benefits. Of the total affected families, 5.3 million would lose at least $25 in SNAP benefits per month. Among these families, 3.3 million are families with children, 3.5 million are working families, and 1.7 million are families with a full-time full-year worker. Families losing at least $25 per month would lose $146 per month on average ($1,752 for a full-year recipient). At the state level, average monthly benefit losses for families losing at least $25 per month would range from $72 in Kansas ($864 annually) to $231 in the District of Columbia ($2,772 annually).” [Urban Institute,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/how-senate-budget-reconciliation-snap-proposals-will-affect-families-every-us">7/2/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>States That Cannot Afford To Pay The New Mandated SNAP Cost Shares May Cut The Program Entirely.</strong> According to CNBC, “Additionally, the legislation requires states to pay for a portion of benefit costs, ranging from 5% to 15%, if their payment error rate is at or over 6%. The error rates measure the accuracy of states’ eligibility and benefit payments. In fiscal year 2024, states had a 10.9% average payment error rate, with many states over 6%, according to the Department of Agriculture. States that can’t pay those shares may have to cut SNAP benefits or opt out of the program entirely, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.” [CNBC, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-cuts-snap-for-millions-of-families.html">7/10/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Every SNAP Dollar Spent Generates $1.54 In Revenue For Local Economies.</strong> According to CNBC, “Every dollar spent on SNAP generates $1.54 in benefit for local economies, according to 2019 research from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service.” [CNBC, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-cuts-snap-for-millions-of-families.html">7/10/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Research Suggested The SNAP Cuts Would Result In 93,000 Premature Deaths.</strong> According to the Leonard Davis Institute Of Health Economics, “Peer-reviewed research from other investigators has quantified the mortality rate of individuals under age 65 with SNAP as compared to a similar group without SNAP over a fourteen-year period.4 Assuming a similar risk profile as prior SNAP participants, if we apply that estimate to the 3.2 million Americans projected to lose SNAP benefits under the bill, that would result in 93,000 premature deaths due to the loss of SNAP between now and 2039.” [Leonard Davis Institute Of Health Economics, <a href="https://ldi.upenn.edu/our-work/research-updates/estimated-mortality-due-to-snap-provisions-in-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act/">7/3/25</a>]</li>

<h4>Husted Supported The One Big Beautiful Bill&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>Husted Claimed That The Bill Would “Make America Safer, Stronger, And More Prosperous.”&nbsp;</strong>According to a press release from Senator Jon Husted, “Today is good news for Ohioans who want to keep more of the money they earn, have access to good jobs, run successful small businesses, live in communities that are protected by a secure border and see America reassert itself as the most confident nation with the strongest military in the world. This bill will make America safer, stronger and more prosperous.” [Press Release – Senator Jon Husted, <a href="https://www.husted.senate.gov/press-releases/husted-statement-on-increasing-tax-cuts-for-working-ohioans-making-americans-safer-and-more-prosperous/">7/1/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>Husted Claimed That The “One Big Beautiful Bill” Was The “Most Pro-Family, Working-Class Bill OF The 21<sup>st</sup> Century.”&nbsp;</strong>According to Signal Akron, “‘If we want to do ‘Made in America,’ we have to encourage people to invest, do research and development, and do manufacturing here,’ he said. ‘I think it’s the most pro-family, working-class bill of the 21st century because it eliminates tax on tips, eliminates tax on overtime and provides a $2,200 per-child tax credit.’” [Signal Akron, <a href="https://signalakron.org/senator-jon-husted-discusses-health-care-medicare-medicaid-immigration-at-akron-roundtable/">8/15/25</a>]</p>

You look at it, it cut the deficit not by nearly enough, but it cuts the deficit. And by the way, what we're talking about now,” [Strictly Speaking with Bob Frantz, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/first1/s-bxxfEu0hnfk?si=836e9b3c70904df0baeebb0bffe7ecac&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">10/02/25</a>]</p>
