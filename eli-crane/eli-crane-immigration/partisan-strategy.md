# Partisan Alignment and Political Strategy

### Summary

-   Eli Crane has been attacked by his own party and allied groups for opposing GOP-backed border security legislation, exposing divisions within Republican ranks and damaging his image as a border hawk ([Cronkite News](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2024/06/19/eli-crane-kevin-mccarthy-gop-primary-payback-ouster/)).

-   His repeated rejection of bipartisan border security bills---citing amnesty and Ukraine funding concerns---has fueled criticism that he prioritizes partisan or Trump-aligned strategy over substantive solutions ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B8Y-N631-DXGX-6216-00000-00&context=1519360), [Casa Grande Dispatch](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B9D-87J1-DXVP-T07Y-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Multiple constituents' letters and editorials accuse Crane of putting Trump's political interests ahead of border policy solutions, undermining his reputation as a problem-solver ([Casa Grande Dispatch](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B9D-87J1-DXVP-T080-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane's unwavering support for Trump and America First policies, including election fraud claims and border wall advocacy, continues to spur attacks from critics who label him extreme and out-of-touch with moderate voters ([Arizona Capitol Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66VR-MHP1-JCP2-543F-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6998-81X1-DY0W-4064-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   His public rhetoric---such as blaming Biden and Harris for fentanyl deaths and violence---risks being perceived as inflammatory or insensitive, potentially alienating voters who prefer more measured discourse ([Casa Grande Dispatch](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CSC-0C51-DXVP-T03W-00000-00&context=1519360)).
