# Border Security and Enforcement

### Summary

-   Eli Crane has repeatedly described the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border as an "invasion," advocating for hardline border policies such as finishing the border wall and returning to Trump-era enforcement measures ([Cronkite News](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2022/10/14/us-house-district-2-eli-crane/), [Arizona Capitol Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66WC-J1W1-JCP2-53BC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He frequently links border security to national crises, including the fentanyl epidemic, and attributes rising illegal immigration and border issues to Biden administration policies that he claims encourage mass migration ([Arizona Mirror](https://azmirror.com/briefs/one-of-eli-cranes-fundraising-consultants-was-busted-for-a-meth-lab-in-2016/), [Casa Grande Dispatch](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BSD-T3W1-DXVP-T0D4-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane has opposed multiple bipartisan or GOP-backed border funding bills, arguing they don't go far enough and could result in "unrestricted amnesty," leading to criticism and targeted political ads from within his own party ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C4V-74M1-JB1V-G3CS-00000-00&context=1519360), [Maricopa Monitor](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CBD-M191-JBCN-3479-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He has publicly declared that "mass deportations aren't merely necessary, they're morally just," and prioritized policy changes like HR2 as the only acceptable approach to border enforcement ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DGK-7261-DXGX-625F-00000-00&context=1519360), [Casa Grande Dispatch](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69VM-1791-JBCN-3493-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerabilities arise from Crane's rejection of border security bills supported by House Republicans and his emphasis on rhetoric over legislative action, resulting in criticism for not constructively addressing the border crisis through available policy measures ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CCF-9R81-JB1V-G0X3-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arizona Daily Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BG4-3HS1-DXVP-T4FH-00000-00&context=1519360)).
