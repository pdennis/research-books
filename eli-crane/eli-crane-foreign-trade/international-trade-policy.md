**April 2025: Eli Crane Participated In Panel Discussion On National Issues At Arizona Biltmore** According to AZFamily, "Taking the stage first, in front of local business leaders, were Republican Reps. Andy Biggs, Eli Crane, Abe Hamadeh and Juan Ciscomani. They were all asked how they feel about Trump's tariffs, and they all continue to support what the President is doing." \[AZFamily, [4/24/25](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/04/24/arizona-gop-lawmakers-defend-trumps-tariffs-trade-policies/)\]
