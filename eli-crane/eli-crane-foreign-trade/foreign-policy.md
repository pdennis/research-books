# Foreign Policy Positions

### Summary

-   Eli Crane has consistently voiced strong nationalist views, framing foreign policy debates as a divide between globalists and nationalists, and emphasizing U.S. national sovereignty ([Copper Courier](https://coppercourier.com/story/5-times-congressional-candidate-eli-crane-campaigned-on-fringe-far-right-conspiracies/)).

-   He is a vocal supporter of Israel, backing U.S. aid following the 2023 Hamas attacks, visiting sites affected by the October 7 attack, meeting Israeli leaders, and describing the U.S.-Israel relationship as a "blessing to the world" ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BTF-GY51-JB1V-G2TC-00000-00&context=1519360), [Geneastar](https://en.geneastar.org/genealogy/craneelijah/eli-crane)).

-   Crane is skeptical of extensive U.S. foreign aid and military engagements, voting to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and opposing the Tibet-China Dispute Act, and criticizing additional foreign aid as "American Last Agenda" ([Vote Smart](https://votesmart.org/bill/37510/100966/205885/eli-crane-voted-nay-passage-s-138-promoting-a-resolution-to-the-tibet-china-dispute-act#100966), [Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BV9-CN41-JB1V-G312-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He has drawn attention for characterizing the Russian invasion of Ukraine as "a land dispute," expressing skepticism about U.S. aid to Ukraine, and responding sarcastically when Russia sanctioned him in 2023 ([Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69VC-2J11-DXVP-T3CK-00000-00&context=1519360), [Casa Grande Dispatch](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68C2-15K1-JBCN-3365-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerability: His rhetoric regarding Ukraine ("a land dispute") and skepticism of aid, along with being sanctioned by Russia, could be used to question his commitment to supporting U.S. allies and posture against authoritarian regimes ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:689H-2RP1-JB1V-G4YV-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69VC-2J11-DXVP-T3CK-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane frequently aligns his foreign policy with former President Trump, signaling an intent to pursue "peace through strength," border security, and America-first policies ([Casa Grande Dispatch](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DFY-8631-JBCN-30VC-00000-00&context=1519360)).
