# Rhetoric, Advocacy, and Public Statements on Poverty

### Summary

-   Eli Crane, Arizona's 2nd District congressman, publicly claimed that government assistance programs, such as unemployment and food stamps, enable people to "make more money than they could actually working," which he described as problematic ([Arizona Daily Sun, 3/10/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67RR-73V1-DXVP-T0VX-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane's remarks suggest a preference for business and corporate interests over the needs of employees, reflecting a critical stance on government aid for low-income individuals ([Arizona Daily Sun, 3/12/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67S0-BDK1-DXVP-T2T0-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   These statements echo longstanding conservative viewpoints that frame government support as a deterrent to employment and self-sufficiency ([Arizona Daily Sun, 3/10/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67RR-73V1-DXVP-T0VX-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane's comments have drawn criticism from local constituents, as highlighted in letters to the editor questioning the factual basis and implications of his views ([Arizona Daily Sun, 3/10/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67RR-73V1-DXVP-T0VX-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerability: Publicly framing assistance programs as overly generous may alienate low-income voters and those who directly benefit from such support systems.
