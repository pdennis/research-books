# Legislative Initiatives and Policy Actions on Poverty

### Positions on Economic Development for Marginalized Groups

#### Support for Veteran Entrepreneurs

**2022: Eli Crane Preferred Private Sector Solutions For Veteran Homelessness** According to InMaricopa, "I've worked with a lot of veteran nonprofits. I think solutions to a lot of our veterans issues are going to come from the private sector. The VA is doing a good job caring for our veterans, but I'd like to see a lot of solutions to this problem come from the private sector." \[InMaricopa, [10/14/22](https://www.inmaricopa.com/crane-says-experience-as-navy-seal-prepared-him-to-be-maricopas-congressman/)\]
