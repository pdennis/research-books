### Public Statements and Campaign Priorities

**2023: Eli Crane Linked Biden Border Policies to Drug Cartels and Fentanyl Crisis** According to an opinion piece by Eli Crane and Kevin Roberts in Casa Grande Dispatch, "Biden's border policies are empowering drug cartels to turn human smuggling into a multibillion-dollar industry. Those policies allow fentanyl to pour into our country, leading to the No. 1 cause of death among young Americans. Those policies leave Americans more vulnerable to terrorist attacks and infiltration from foreign enemies including the Chinese Communist Party." \[Eli Crane and Kevin Roberts - Casa Grande Dispatch, [12/11/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69VM-1791-JBCN-3493-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
