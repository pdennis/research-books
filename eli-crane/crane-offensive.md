## 2023: Crane Referred To African Americans As “Colored People” On The House Floor

### 2023: Crane Was Reprimanded For Using the Term “Colored People” While Speaking On The House Floor

**7/13/23: Crane Referred To African Americans As “Colored People” On The House Floor.** According to the Hill, "A first-term Republican lawmaker referred to African Americans as ‘colored people’ on the House floor Thursday, prompting outrage from Democrats and a quick rebuke from the chamber’s presiding officer.  Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) was reprimanded after he took to the floor to promote an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that he says will rein in Defense Department ‘wokeness’ — a racially charged concept that has divided the parties and the country in recent years." \[The Hill, [7/13/23](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4096840-arizona-republicans-colored-people-remark-draws-floor-rebuke/)\]

**Crane Claimed He “Misspoke” When He Referred To African Americans As “Colored People” While Debating His Proposed Amendment To Prohibit The Pentagon From Utilizing “Certain Race-Based Concepts” In Their Hiring Process.** According to CBS News, "Arizona Republican Rep. Eli Crane said he ‘misspoke’ after he used the racially charged term ‘colored people’ on the House floor and drew swift rebuke from Democratic lawmakers and the Congressional Black Caucus.  ‘In a heated floor debate on my amendment that would prohibit discrimination on the color of one's skin in the Armed Forces, I misspoke. Every one of us is made in the image of God and created equal,’ Crane said in a statement.  The freshman Republican used the term Thursday evening as members were debating one of his proposed amendments to the annual defense budget and policy bill. His amendment would prohibit the Pentagon from requiring participation in training or support for ‘certain race-based concepts’ in the hiring, promotion or retention of individuals.  Crane was responding to remarks made by Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty when he said, ‘My amendment has nothing to do with whether or not colored people or Black people or anybody can serve, okay? It has nothing to do with color of your skin... any of that stuff.’" \[CBS News, [7/14/23](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eli-crane-colored-people-remark-house-floor/)\]

**Crane’s Language Was Stricken From The Record.** According to the Arizona Republic, "Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, immediately motioned to have the words ‘colored people’ removed from the record. ‘I find it offensive and very inappropriate,’ she said on the floor. Crane then rose to amend his comments on the record, to which Beatty responded by saying that she did not ask for an amendment, but to have the words unanimously stricken. There were no objections." \[Arizona Republic, [7/13/25](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2023/07/13/rep-eli-crane-refers-to-black-americans-as-colored-people-on-house-floor/70412406007/)\]
