# Voting Rights and Election Policy

### Summary

-   Eli Crane repeatedly promoted unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, including public statements and op-eds, making him vulnerable to criticism for spreading misinformation ([KJZZ](https://www.kjzz.org/2022-09-30/content-1814001-district-2-race-pits-stop-steal-candidate-against-sitting-congressman), [Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/jul/24/arizonans-need-warfighter-address-corruption-washi/)).

-   Crane's campaign focus on "election integrity" and support for controversial Arizona audits tie him closely to "Stop the Steal" efforts, which have been widely discredited ([Copper Courier](https://coppercourier.com/2022/11/07/5-times-congressional-candidate-eli-crane-campaigned-on-fringe-far-right-conspiracies/), [DCCC Press Release](https://dccc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/220906-Eli-Crane-AZ-02-Research-Memo-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf)).

-   His proposals for restrictive voting laws---such as ending mail-in ballots and strengthening voter ID requirements---could be seen as targeting voter access and disproportionately affecting marginalized groups ([Arizona Daily Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66HN-1VK1-DXVP-V080-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arizona Capitol Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66WC-J1W1-JCP2-53BC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane's support for the ACE Act has been publicly criticized for potentially making it harder for disabled veterans and other vulnerable populations to vote ([Arizona Daily Sun 9/9/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:694H-S011-DXVP-T4FT-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arizona Daily Sun 9/10/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:694T-1TS1-JBCN-3226-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   At times, Crane has avoided explicit claims about fraud while continuing to advocate for restrictive changes, opening him to accusations of inconsistency or political opportunism ([Maricopa Monitor](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:638J-HS91-DXVP-V3TY-00000-00&context=1519360)).
