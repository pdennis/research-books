# Minority Rights and Equal Protection

### Summary

-   Rep. Eli Crane used the term "colored people" during a July 2023 House floor debate over his amendment to a defense policy bill, sparking bipartisan condemnation and accusations of using racially insensitive language ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/rep-eli-crane-refers-black-americans-colored-people-house-floor-rcna94200), [Cronkite News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68PK-GJW1-JBCN-304X-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane claimed he "misspoke" and attempted to amend his words to "people of color" in the official record, but his request was unsuccessful; he stated the intent was to prohibit discrimination in the military, not to exclude anyone ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/rep-eli-crane-refers-black-americans-colored-people-house-floor-rcna94200), [Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68PR-X1R1-DXVP-T0J4-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The incident elicited strong rebukes from Congressional leadership and the Congressional Black Caucus, who called Crane's remarks "shameful" and demanded an apology, with some lawmakers warning it was a "dog whistle to white nationalists" ([Cronkite News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68PK-GJW1-JBCN-304X-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68PR-X1R1-DXVP-T0J4-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane's amendment, which passed, restricts the Department of Defense from considering race, gender, religion, or political affiliation as the sole basis for recruitment, training, or promotion decisions in the military ([Cronkite News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68PK-GJW1-JBCN-304X-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68PR-X1R1-DXVP-T0J4-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane asserted that military strength relies on its standards rather than diversity, arguing that the military was "never intended to be... inclusive," a stance that drew further criticism regarding the implications for equal protection and minority rights ([Cronkite News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68PK-GJW1-JBCN-304X-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68PR-X1R1-DXVP-T0J4-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerability exists in the perception that Crane's language and arguments could undermine efforts to promote diversity and equal opportunity in the military, and may alienate minority communities.
