# Family's Public Role and Media Presence

### Summary

-   Eli Crane's family members have a visible public role, frequently accompanying him at high-profile political events and local stores, heightening their exposure in political activities ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66NX-D6X1-DXGX-6554-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6731-4231-DXVP-V0JW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The family's routine presence at campaign events creates potential safety risks, as demonstrated by their proximity to a store before a threat was discovered ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66NX-D6X1-DXGX-6554-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Association with controversial figures (e.g., attending events alongside Wendy Rogers) could attract negative media attention or alienate some voters ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66NX-D6X1-DXGX-6554-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The family's participation in publicly covered campaign activities and public spaces increases the risk of unwanted press, especially if incidents or threats occur ([Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6731-4231-DXVP-V0JW-00000-00&context=1519360)).
