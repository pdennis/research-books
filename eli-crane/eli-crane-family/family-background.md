#### Family Influence

**2016: Eli Crane Traveled To Coronado To Support Keating's Family After Keating's Death** According to Arizona Republic, "Crane immediately called his wife, packed a bag and left Tucson for Coronado, Calif., the small city near San Diego that is home to the naval base familiar to Crane, Keating and family. Although loved ones already had been informed, Crane wanted to be there for Keating's father, stepmother, brother, fiancee and many others who met Tuesday night to mourn the loss." \[Arizona Republic (Phoenix), [5/5/16](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5JPD-MM71-DYJJ-P4R1-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
