# Legislative Initiatives and Economic Development

### Summary

-   Eli Crane has consistently advocated for low taxes, less regulation, and pro-growth, pro-job policies as central themes in his campaigns ([Arizona Republic](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/07/20/two-gop-candidates-enter-race-arizonas-1st-congressional-district/8034878002/)).

-   As a congressional candidate, Crane emphasized removing government barriers for small business owners to encourage entrepreneurship and reduce burdensome regulations ([KNST AM 790 interview](https://knst.iheart.com/featured/garret-lewis/content/2021-12-01-garret-talks-to-eli-crane-candidate-for-congress-in-cd-1/)).

-   He supports free market approaches to economic growth, aiming to appeal to moderates and right-leaning independents, particularly in Arizona's Yavapai County ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D1B-W5M1-JB1V-G1W7-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane co-introduced the Native American Entrepreneurial Opportunity Act, aiming to create an Office of Native American Affairs within the Small Business Administration to help Native American entrepreneurs navigate regulatory challenges ([Arizona Daily Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D9M-DM11-JBCN-34WP-00000-00&context=1519360), [Casa Grande Dispatch](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0F-BYR1-DXVP-T2XH-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Vulnerability: Crane justified his business's use of pandemic-era PPP loans by blaming government-mandated shutdowns; critics may see this as conflicting with his minimal-government stance ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65VM-GB51-JB1V-G28T-00000-00&context=1519360)).
