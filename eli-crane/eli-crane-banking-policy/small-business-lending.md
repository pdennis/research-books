# Small Business, Lending, and Entrepreneurship

### Summary

-   Rep. Eli Crane consistently questioned the federal government's efficiency in small-business lending, with most witnesses at a House Small Business Committee hearing expressing doubts about this efficiency ([Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68B5-N1V1-DXVP-T10C-00000-00&context=1519360), [Cronkite News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:689P-R511-DXVP-T4J0-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane argued against heavy federal involvement in small-business funding, stating he preferred limited government in these matters.

-   He specifically questioned whether the federal government, including the SBA, should be in the business of making small-business loans at all.

-   Crane positioned himself as a supporter of veteran entrepreneurs but shifted the discussion from improving SBA support to minimizing government loan involvement.

-   After the hearing, Crane reiterated his belief that small-businesses and Americans would be better served with the government staying out of small-business funding.

-   These positions highlight a potential vulnerability: removing or reducing federal support could impact access to crucial funding for small and veteran-owned businesses.
