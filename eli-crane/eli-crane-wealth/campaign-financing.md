# Campaign Financing and Fundraising

### Summary

-   Eli Crane's campaigns have paid fundraising consultant Emily Pitha over \$146,000 since 2022, despite her past drug conviction; Crane publicly defended this hiring choice ([Arizona Mirror](https://azmirror.com/briefs/one-of-eli-cranes-fundraising-consultants-was-busted-for-a-meth-lab-in-2016/)).

-   Crane received the maximum legal donation of \$6,600 from Elon Musk after filing impeachment articles against a federal judge, but stated Musk's donation was not his motive for the action ([Arizona Republic](https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/ej-montini/2025/03/21/musk-donates-republicans-congress-crane/82574879007/), [Arizona Daily Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FF2-KK73-RRY8-X44X-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane did not accept PAC donations during his 2021 fundraising but has since received contributions from business groups and PACs, including Club for Growth, which spent about \$100,000 in his support ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D85-Y3H1-JB1V-G3FW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   In the 2022 election cycle, about \$1 million supporting Crane came from groups aligned with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, indicating significant outside support ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C4V-74M1-JB1V-G3CS-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Most of Crane's early campaign funds were raised from small-dollar individual donors, with over half of that money coming from Arizona residents ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:64P1-3W01-JC3H-045K-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerabilities include Crane's continued association with a consultant who has a felony drug conviction and the acceptance of large sums from controversial donors and outside political groups.
