# Media Engagement and Public Image

### Media Engagement and Public Image

#### Social Media Presence and Messaging

**2024: Eli Crane Promoted Conspiracy Theories About Trump Assassination Attempts** According to Geneastar, "On multiple occasions, Crane has promoted conspiracy theories about both the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Pennsylvania in July 2024 and the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Florida in September 2024. For the first attempted assassination, Crane has promoted the conspiracy theory that the gunman did not act alone, and for the second attempted assassination, Crane has promoted the conspiracy theory that the gunman was an 'asset' of a foreign adversary." \[Geneastar, [1/1/23](https://en.geneastar.org/genealogy/craneelijah/eli-crane)\]

### Criticism from Local Media Outlets

**March 2025: Crane's Office Provided No Comment On Protests** According to Arizona Daily Sun, "The Arizona Daily Sun reached out to Crane's communications director on Monday and again on Tuesday to see if the representative or anyone affiliated with his office wished to comment on the protests. At the time of publication, Crane's office had not replied to those inquiries." \[Arizona Daily Sun, [3/27/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FF2-KK73-RRY8-X44X-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
