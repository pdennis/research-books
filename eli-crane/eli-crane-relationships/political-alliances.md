# Political Alliances and Opponents

### Summary

-   Crane's hardline alignment with the far-right, MAGA wing of the GOP---including outspoken support for Donald Trump and membership in the House Freedom Caucus---has drawn criticism for extremism and resistance to bipartisan cooperation ([Arizona Republic](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/07/20/two-gop-candidates-enter-race-arizonas-1st-congressional-district/), [KNAU](https://www.knau.org/knau-and-arizona-news/2024-10-29/eli-crane-jonathan-nez-face-off-in-election-for-arizonas-2nd-congressional-district))

-   His leadership in the movement to oust Speaker Kevin McCarthy---including being the only freshman member involved---has made him a target for intra-party backlash, primary challenges, and negative ads from McCarthy allies ([Arizona Republic](https://azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2024/03/12/eli-crane-targeted-after-removing-kevin-mccarthy/72294328007), [Cronkite News](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2024/06/19/eli-crane-kevin-mccarthy-gop-primary-payback-ouster/))

-   Frequent willingness to antagonize both Democrats and moderate Republicans, plus self-described "scorched-earth" style, reinforce perceptions of divisiveness and instability, alienating potential swing or centrist voters ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CX5-9BF1-JB1V-G464-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CXT-WTC1-JBCN-34SS-00000-00&context=1519360))
