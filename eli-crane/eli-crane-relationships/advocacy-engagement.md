# Engagement with Advocacy and Interest Groups

### Summary

-   In 2021, Eli Crane received endorsements from the Border Patrol Union and conservative radio host Mark Levin, highlighting his alignment with key conservative and law enforcement groups ([GunsAmerica Interview](https://www.gunsamerica.com/digest/exclusive-eli-crane-talks-favorite-guns-seal-stories-and-flipping-the-house-for-republicans-in-2022/)).

-   In April 2024, the American Prosperity Alliance, a group linked to Kevin McCarthy, ran attack ads against Crane criticizing his vote against a border security bill and his opposition to funding for ICE, the border wall, and additional agents ([Cronkite News, 6/19/24](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2024/06/19/eli-crane-kevin-mccarthy-gop-primary-payback-ouster/)).

-   The ads associated Crane with negative imagery related to fentanyl and cartels, indicating targeted efforts to portray him as weak on border security.

-   In February 2024, the Republicans For Ukraine coalition gave Crane an 'F' rating for his voting record on Ukraine, signaling disapproval from pro-Ukraine Republican advocates ([Cronkite News, 2/24/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BDB-W921-JBCN-31BW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   These interactions show Crane both attracting support from influential conservative groups and facing criticism from advocacy organizations, suggesting vulnerabilities in his stance on border security and foreign policy.
