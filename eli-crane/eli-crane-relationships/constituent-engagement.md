# Engagement with Constituents, Advocacy Groups, and the Public

### Summary

-   Eli Crane has faced substantial criticism and protest from constituents and advocacy groups regarding his limited public engagement, appointment-only constituent meetings, and perceived unavailability, particularly in Northern Arizona ([Arizona Daily Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FF2-KK73-RRY8-X44X-00000-00&context=1519360), [KNAU](https://www.knau.org/knau-and-arizona-news/2025-03-25/frustrated-by-federal-cuts-protesters-call-on-rep-eli-crane-to-hold-public-town-hall)).

-   Numerous letter writers and local leaders have accused Crane of aligning with extreme right-wing and MAGA factions, spreading conspiracy theories, and supporting controversial Trump administration policies, leading to public demands for him to denounce figures associated with white supremacist views ([Arizona Daily Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:688X-96V1-DXVP-T4JF-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:699F-XH61-DXVP-T025-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane has drawn national attention and condemnation, including from the Congressional Black Caucus and House leadership, for using the term "colored people" during a House floor debate, an incident for which he apologized and claimed to have misspoken ([Casa Grande Dispatch](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68T6-BRB1-DXVP-T23R-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68PK-J6S1-JB1V-G10J-00000-00&context=1519360), [Phoenix New Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:699V-WFV1-JBCN-33HS-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   In response to accusations of extremism and white supremacy, Crane has publicly rejected these labels, stating such claims are unfounded and politically motivated ([Copper Courier](https://coppercourier.com/2022/11/07/5-times-congressional-candidate-eli-crane-campaigned-on-fringe-far-right-conspiracies/)).

-   Questions about Crane's connection to his district have arisen, with critics alleging he is more attentive to metropolitan areas and does not reside in nor fully understand the rural district's concerns ([Navajo Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CNS-H2G1-JBCN-30VJ-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arizona Daily Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FF2-KK73-RRY8-X44X-00000-00&context=1519360)).
