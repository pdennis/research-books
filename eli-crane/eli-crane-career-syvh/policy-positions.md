# Key Policy Positions and Political Actions

### Summary

-   Consistent focus on border issues, fentanyl, and "cultural Marxism" may align with partisan or divisive rhetoric, risking alienation of moderate voters ([InMaricopa](https://www.inmaricopa.com/crane-says-experience-as-navy-seal-prepared-him-to-be-maricopas-congressman/), [KJZZ](https://www.kjzz.org/2022-09-30/content-1814001-district-2-race-pits-stop-steal-candidate-against-sitting-congressman))

-   Emphasis on "election integrity" and retweeting Stop the Steal symbolism connects Crane to election denial and January 6th associations, which could damage credibility with mainstream constituents ([Phoenix New Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C51-WGH1-DXVP-T0W4-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Publicly stating the U.S. faces greater internal than external threats could be seen as undermining national unity or prioritizing partisan grievances ([Press Release - Eli Crane for Congress](https://eliforarizona.com/eli-cranes-raises-more-than-400000-in-q3/))

-   Harsh criticism of the Biden administration, including claims of "collapse" and "corrupt and abusive government," could be viewed as extreme or hyperbolic by moderate voters ([Press Release - Eli Crane for Congress](https://eliforarizona.com/eli-cranes-raises-more-than-400000-in-q3/))

-   Characterizing Trump's criminal trial as "weaponized justice system" and "election interference" could further entrench perceptions of partisanship and willingness to undermine judicial institutions ([Phoenix New Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C51-WGH1-DXVP-T0W4-00000-00&context=1519360))

It really concerns me." \[InMaricopa, [10/14/22](https://www.inmaricopa.com/crane-says-experience-as-navy-seal-prepared-him-to-be-maricopas-congressman/)\]
