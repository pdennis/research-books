# Election and Congressional Representation

### Incumbency in Arizona's 2nd Congressional District

**July 2023: Eli Crane Represented Arizona's Rural 2nd Congressional District** According to Cronkite News: Arizona State University, "But Rodd McLeod, an Arizona political campaign strategist, said the moment is unlikely to affect Crane's chances in 2024, in his Republican-leaning, rural 2nd District, which covers much of northeastern Arizona." \[Cronkite News: Arizona State University (Tempe), [7/15/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68PK-GJW1-JBCN-304X-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2024: Jonathan Nez Referred To Eli Crane As The Incumbent Of Arizona's District 2** According to Navajo Times, "Although Nez has no primary candidate, he is the most viable candidate to beat the 'incumbent' Eli Crane." \[Navajo Times, [6/13/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C8C-KN81-JBCN-30B3-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
