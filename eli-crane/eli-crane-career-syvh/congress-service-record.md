# Congressional Service and Legislative Record

### Summary

-   Eli Crane was elected to represent Arizona's 2nd Congressional District in 2022, defeating incumbent Tom O'Halleran by approximately 7-8%, and won reelection in 2024 against Jonathan Nez ([Arizona Daily Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F73-K0N3-RRX3-R12G-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arizona Mirror](https://azmirror.com/briefs/eli-crane-wins-second-term-in-u-s-house-of-representatives/)).

-   In Congress, Crane served on the House Homeland Security, Veterans' Affairs, Small Business, and Oversight Committees, and was a member of the House Freedom Caucus, Western Caucus, and Copper Caucus ([GovTrack.us](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/eli_crane/456879), [Arizona Mirror](https://azmirror.com/briefs/eli-crane-wins-second-term-in-u-s-house-of-representatives/)).

-   Crane's legislative focus centered on veterans' issues, public lands, natural resources, and immigration, introducing around 15 bills during his first term; only two or three passed the House and none became law as of late 2024 ([Arizona Mirror](https://azmirror.com/briefs/eli-crane-wins-second-term-in-u-s-house-of-representatives/), [KNAU](https://www.knau.org/knau-and-arizona-news/2024-10-29/eli-crane-jonathan-nez-face-off-in-election-for-arizonas-2nd-congressional-district)).

-   He gained national attention for joining a small group of Republicans to oust Speaker Kevin McCarthy and for supporting impeachment inquiries against President Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ([Arizona Republic](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2023/10/04/who-is-eli-crane-congressman-from-arizona/71059449007/), [Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B7G-HNK1-JBCN-334V-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerability: Crane's effectiveness as a legislator has been questioned as he sponsored fewer bills than his Arizona colleagues, passed none into law during his first term, and attracted few cosponsors to his legislation ([GovTrack.us](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/eli_crane/456879/report-card/2024), [Arizona Capitol Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C09-NFP1-JCP2-5053-00000-00&context=1519360)).
