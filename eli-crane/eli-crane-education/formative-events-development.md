# Formative Events and Personal Development

### Summary

-   Heavy reliance on Navy SEAL identity could face criticism for limited political or policy experience outside military service ([Arizona Republic](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/07/20/two-gop-candidates-enter-race-arizonas-1st-congressional-district/8034878002/), [Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/navy-seal-shark-tank-winner-takes-on-vulnerable-arizona-house-democrat))

-   Limited documentation of non-military formative experiences or broader community involvement can suggest a narrow personal development narrative ([Arizona Republic](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2023/10/04/who-is-eli-crane-congressman-from-arizona/71059449007/), [Maricopa Monitor](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DCB-BT61-DXVP-T1TR-00000-00&context=1519360))
