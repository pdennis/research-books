### Summary

-   Eli Crane was born in Tucson, Arizona, on January 3, 1980, and is considered a native Arizonan ([Geneastar](https://en.geneastar.org/genealogy/craneelijah/eli-crane), [SOAA](https://soaa.org/team/eli-crane/), [Common Ground Scorecard](https://commongroundscorecard.org/eli-crane/)).

-   As of 2024, Crane is 43 years old and resides in Oro Valley, outside Arizona's 2nd congressional district, though he is originally from Tucson ([Casa Grande Dispatch](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DD3-2C71-DXVP-T4FW-00000-00&context=1519360), [Florence Reminder and Blade-Tribune](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DB4-TT21-JBCN-34C5-00000-00&context=1519360)).
