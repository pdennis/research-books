# Entrepreneurial Ventures and Business Leadership

### Summary

-   Eli Crane co-founded the company Bottle Breacher with his wife Jen in 2012, creating bottle openers from .50-caliber shells and emphasizing veteran employment; the business gained national attention after its appearance on "Shark Tank" in 2014, securing deals with Mark Cuban and Kevin O'Leary ([Arizona Republic](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2023/10/04/who-is-eli-crane-congressman-from-arizona/71059449007/), [Cronkite News](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2022/10/14/us-house-district-2-eli-crane/), [InMaricopa](https://www.inmaricopa.com/crane-says-experience-as-navy-seal-prepared-him-to-be-maricopas-congressman/)).

-   Crane prioritized manufacturing in the U.S. and hiring veterans, successfully growing Bottle Breacher into a multi-million dollar, veteran-owned brand that donated to over 100 non-profits ([VeteranCrowd Network](https://veterancrowdnetwork.com/2021/09/eli-crane-navy-seal-veteran-bottle-breacher-ceo-congressional-candidate/), [SOAA](https://soaa.org/team/eli-crane/), [NRCC](https://nrcc.org/candidates/eli-crane/)).

-   During the COVID-19 pandemic, Bottle Breacher lawfully obtained and had forgiven a nearly \$70,000 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan, but Crane later declined further government assistance as the business recovered and became debt free ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65VM-GB51-JB1V-G28T-00000-00&context=1519360), [DCCC Research Memo](https://dccc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/220906-Eli-Crane-AZ-02-Research-Memo-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf)).

-   Crane sold Bottle Breacher in 2022 and has since emphasized how overcoming adversity and building the brand prepared him for leadership, stating he wants to bring his business and military experience to Congress ([Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/navy-seal-shark-tank-winner-takes-on-vulnerable-arizona-house-democrat), [Geneastar](https://en.geneastar.org/genealogy/craneelijah/eli-crane), [VeteranCrowd Network](https://veterancrowdnetwork.com/2022/11/eli-crane-navy-veteran-running-for-u-s-congress/)).

-   Potential vulnerabilities include Bottle Breacher's receipt of PPP funds during the pandemic, which may attract scrutiny, although the loan was legally obtained and fully forgiven ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65VM-GB51-JB1V-G28T-00000-00&context=1519360), [DCCC Research Memo](https://dccc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/220906-Eli-Crane-AZ-02-Research-Memo-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf)).
