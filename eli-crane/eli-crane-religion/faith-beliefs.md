# Personal Faith and Religious Beliefs

### Summary

-   Eli Crane's strong alignment with faith-oriented and conservative values may alienate moderate or independent voters who are less religious or hold different beliefs ([Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6731-41R1-DXVP-V53H-00000-00&context=1519360), [Green Beret PAC](https://greenberetpac.com/eli-crane/)).

-   His public statement that "one cannot claim to be both a Christian and a Democrat" and referring to the Democratic party as "godless demonic" could be seen as intolerant or divisive, risking backlash from religious Democrats and interfaith communities ([DCCC Research Memo](https://dccc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/220906-Eli-Crane-AZ-02-Research-Memo-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf)).

-   Strong pro-life and pro-Second Amendment stances, highlighted in campaign messaging, might limit appeal among voters who support abortion rights or gun control ([Green Beret PAC](https://greenberetpac.com/eli-crane/), [Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6731-41R1-DXVP-V53H-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane's open criticism of the Biden administration for actions perceived as targeting Christian institutions may be interpreted as using religion for political attacks, which could diminish appeal to voters looking for nonpartisan leadership ([Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69M6-WMV1-DXVP-T1DV-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Statements emphasizing that "every one of us is made in the image of God" may not resonate with secular constituents or those seeking greater separation of church and state in public policy ([Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68PR-X1R1-DXVP-T0J4-00000-00&context=1519360)).
