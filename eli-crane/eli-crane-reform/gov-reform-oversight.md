# Government Reform and Oversight

### Summary

-   Crane voted against the Separation of Powers Restoration Act of 2023, a bill intended to rebalance power between Congress and the executive branch ([AFL-CIO scorecard](https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/eli-crane)).

-   He also opposed the REINS Act of 2023, which would have limited the ability of federal agencies to enact major regulations without congressional approval ([AFL-CIO scorecard](https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/eli-crane)).

-   According to the AFL-CIO, both votes were viewed negatively in terms of supporting oversight and accountability of the executive branch.

-   In a 2025 statement, Crane claimed he believes the federal government was more involved in the January 6th events than publicly acknowledged, suggesting skepticism of official narratives ([Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DV0-M4G3-RSXW-B0DP-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   These positions may expose Crane to criticism for opposing measures aimed at increasing congressional oversight and for promoting controversial views regarding January 6th.
