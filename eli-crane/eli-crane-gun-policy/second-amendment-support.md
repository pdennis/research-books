# Support for Second Amendment Rights

### Summary

-   Strong opposition to red flag laws may be controversial among voters seeking balanced gun safety measures; stance could appear uncompromising ([GunsAmerica Interview, 2021](https://www.gunsamerica.com/digest/exclusive-eli-crane-talks-favorite-guns-seal-stories-and-flipping-the-house-for-republicans-in-2022/)).

-   Repeated claims that the "Left" broadly seeks to take away firearms risk alienating moderates and could be seen as overly partisan ([GunsAmerica Interview, 2021](https://www.gunsamerica.com/digest/exclusive-eli-crane-talks-favorite-guns-seal-stories-and-flipping-the-house-for-republicans-in-2022/)).

-   Criticism of mainstream media coverage of gun owners could be interpreted as dismissive of legitimate concerns about gun violence ([Cronkite News, 2022](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2022/10/14/us-house-district-2-eli-crane/)).

-   Accusations that the Biden Administration wants to "strip veterans of their 2nd Amendment rights" may be viewed as inflammatory or unsubstantiated by nonpartisan audiences ([Casa Grande Dispatch, 2024](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CY5-J0B1-JBCN-33NT-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Framing Second Amendment issues strictly as attacks on rights and freedoms may not address public concerns about gun safety, limiting broader appeal.

### Opposition to Gun Control Measures

#### Rejection of New Firearms Restrictions

**2021: Eli Crane Opposed Red Flag Laws and Pledged Support for Second Amendment** In an interview with GunsAmerica, Eli Crane said, "I know what the Left is trying to do when it comes to the Second Amendment---they're trying to take our firearms away. When I vote regarding the Second Amendment, I'm going to continue to support the Constitution and what it says: our rights shall not be infringed. I'm not going to support red flag laws. \[...\] Anything and everything that the Left is allowed to get a foothold in will be weaponized to take away rights and freedoms from Americans. I'm never going to be a part of that." \[Interview - Eli Crane with GunsAmerica, [11/2/21](https://www.gunsamerica.com/digest/exclusive-eli-crane-talks-favorite-guns-seal-stories-and-flipping-the-house-for-republicans-in-2022/)\]
