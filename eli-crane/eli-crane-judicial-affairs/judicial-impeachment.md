# Judicial Oversight and Impeachment

### Summary

-   Eli Crane's primary focus on impeaching federal judges, rather than addressing constituent concerns like the Navajo Code Talkers issue, exposes him to criticism of misplaced priorities ([Phoenix New Times](https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/arizona-rep-crane-silent-purge-navajo-code-talkers-webpages-21412047)).

-   His impeachment campaign against Judge Engelmayer was widely characterized as political theater, with little expectation of success, raising questions about his motives and effectiveness ([Arizona Republic - EJ Montini](https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/ej-montini/2025/03/21/musk-donates-republicans-congress-crane/82574879007/)).

-   Crane's repeated public statements and social media posts accusing federal judges of partisanship and overreach have fueled allegations of undermining judicial independence ([Arizona Republic, Feb 13, 14, 2025](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F48-TD93-S3XX-T1T1-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Critics, including constituents and media, have called out Crane for ignoring conservative principles regarding judicial independence, leaving him exposed to charges of hypocrisy ([Arizona Daily Sun, Letter to the Editor](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FH6-9853-RS2K-03MH-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Public and media scrutiny of Musk's involvement and financial support in these impeachment efforts have raised concerns about the political influence of wealthy donors over Crane's legislative actions ([Arizona Republic - EJ Montini](https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/ej-montini/2025/03/21/musk-donates-republicans-congress-crane/82574879007/)).
