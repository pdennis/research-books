### Summary

-   Eli Crane has served as a brand ambassador for Sig Sauer firearms, representing the company in Arizona and nationally ([Arizona Republic](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2023/10/04/who-is-eli-crane-congressman-from-arizona/71059449007/), [Geneastar](https://en.geneastar.org/genealogy/craneelijah/eli-crane), [Arizona Daily Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66HN-1VK1-DXVP-V080-00000-00&context=1519360), [Green Beret PAC](https://greenberetpac.com/eli-crane/)).

-   His role as brand ambassador is repeatedly highlighted in local and national media, suggesting a significant presence in outdoor and shooting communities.

-   Marketing materials and press reports describe Crane as a "conservative warrior," "faith-oriented family man," and strong supporter of Second Amendment rights ([Arizona Daily Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66HN-1VK1-DXVP-V080-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   In addition to his ambassador role, Crane served on the national Advisory Committee on Veteran Business Affairs, engaging on issues relevant to veterans ([Green Beret PAC](https://greenberetpac.com/eli-crane/)).

-   Crane's visible association with Sig Sauer firearms ties him closely to gun rights advocacy, which may be viewed as a strength or a vulnerability, depending on audience and context.
