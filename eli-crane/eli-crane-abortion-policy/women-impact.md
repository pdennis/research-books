# Impact on Women and Constituent Responses

### Summary

-   Jonathan Nez, former Navajo Nation president and Democratic candidate for CD-2, publicly criticized Eli Crane for supporting abortion restrictions following the Arizona Supreme Court ruling ([Maricopa Monitor](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BS5-H9H1-JBCN-34XB-00000-00&context=1519360), [Casa Grande Dispatch](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BTG-N671-JBCN-306B-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Nez argued that Crane's stance on abortion represents a broader trend of "extremists" who are out of touch with the values and concerns of everyday Arizonans.

-   The criticism from Nez centers on the negative impact of abortion restrictions on women's reproductive health care and rights.

-   Nez pledged to restore and protect women's rights to choose and access fundamental health care if elected to Congress ([Maricopa Monitor](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BS5-H9H1-JBCN-34XB-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The public response from Nez may highlight political vulnerability for Eli Crane, as it positions him and his support for abortion restrictions as controversial among constituents.
