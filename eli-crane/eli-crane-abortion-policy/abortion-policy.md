# Abortion Policy Positions

### Summary

-   Eli Crane strongly supported the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, calling the ruling a "groundbreaking victory for life" and arguing that the Constitution does not authorize abortion rights ([Cronkite News](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2022/10/14/us-house-district-2-eli-crane/), [Arizona Daily Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BTG-N671-JBCN-3009-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane identifies as pro-life and has frequently expressed opposition to abortion in all but the most extreme cases, supporting prohibitions except when necessary to save the mother's life ([DCCC Research Memo](https://dccc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/220906-Eli-Crane-AZ-02-Research-Memo-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf)).

-   In 2024, Crane co-sponsored the "Life at Conception Act," which aims to ban nearly all abortions nationwide and restrict access to birth control and IVF, reflecting a hardline stance against reproductive rights ([Arizona Mirror](https://azmirror.com/briefs/eli-crane-wins-second-term-in-u-s-house-of-representatives/), [Florence Reminder and Blade-Tribune](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DB4-TT21-JBCN-34C5-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He has consistently promoted pro-life positions as a core part of his political identity, highlighting this stance in campaign materials and press releases ([NRCC](https://nrcc.org/candidates/eli-crane/), [Arizona Capitol Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66VR-MHP1-JCP2-543F-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane's co-sponsorship of legislation that would ban abortion with no exceptions, as well as restrict birth control and IVF, may expose him to criticism for supporting policies that go beyond abortion to other aspects of reproductive healthcare ([Casa Grande Dispatch](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DFY-8631-JBCN-30VC-00000-00&context=1519360)).
