### Summary

-   Eli Crane, a political newcomer, former Navy SEAL, and business owner, ran as a pro-Trump, MAGA-aligned Republican in Arizona's newly redrawn 2nd Congressional District and defeated incumbent Democrat Tom O'Halleran by nearly eight percentage points ([Arizona Republic](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2023/10/04/who-is-eli-crane-congressman-from-arizona/71059449007/), [Arizona Daily Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6731-41V1-DXVP-V4R8-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The district, reshaped by 2022 redistricting to strongly favor Republicans, gave Crane a significant advantage and was rated as "Likely Republican" by Real Clear Politics ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:663F-J6R1-JB1V-G31P-00000-00&context=1519360), [Cronkite News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6731-41V1-DXVP-V4PW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane's campaign emphasized election integrity, border security, pro-life, pro-gun positions, support for military/veterans, and opposition to vaccine mandates, lockdowns, and critical race theory ([Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6731-41R1-DXVP-V3V3-00000-00&context=1519360), [Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/jul/24/arizonans-need-warfighter-address-corruption-washi/)).

-   He received endorsements from former President Donald Trump and prominent conservatives, and benefitted from substantial outside support, including over \$1.7 million from the National Republican Congressional Committee and \$900,000 from a McCarthy-affiliated PAC ([Cronkite News](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2024/06/19/eli-crane-kevin-mccarthy-gop-primary-payback-ouster/), [Arizona Capitol Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66WC-J1W1-JCP2-53BC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerability: Critics noted Crane's far-right positioning, lack of government experience, and avoidance of mainstream forums could have made him a target in a less GOP-favored district ([Arizona Capitol Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:665S-2GS1-F053-W28W-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arizona Daily Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66HN-1VK1-DXVP-V080-00000-00&context=1519360)).
