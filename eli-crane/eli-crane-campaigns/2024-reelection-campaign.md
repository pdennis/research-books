# 2024 Congressional Re-election Campaign

### Summary

-   Crane faced criticism for declining to debate his Democratic challenger Jonathan Nez, leading to repeated accusations of avoiding public scrutiny and engagement on key issues ([Navajo Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5S-46W1-DXVP-T351-00000-00&context=1519360); [Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CX5-9BF1-JB1V-G464-00000-00&context=1519360); [Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CXT-WTC1-JBCN-34SS-00000-00&context=1519360); [KNAU](https://www.knau.org/knau-and-arizona-news/2024-10-29/eli-crane-jonathan-nez-face-off-in-election-for-arizonas-2nd-congressional-district)).

-   He was portrayed by opponents, especially Jonathan Nez, as an extremist and more focused on national MAGA/Trumpism over local district needs, which could alienate moderate voters ([Casa Grande Dispatch](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CMD-RJ01-JBCN-34C5-00000-00&context=1519360); [Navajo Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CNS-H2G1-JBCN-30VJ-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The GOP primary featured a well-financed challenge from Jack Smith, reportedly backed by former Speaker Kevin McCarthy's allies, highlighting intraparty tensions and lingering fallout from Crane's vote to oust McCarthy ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C4V-74M1-JB1V-G3CS-00000-00&context=1519360); [Cronkite News](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2024/06/19/eli-crane-kevin-mccarthy-gop-primary-payback-ouster/)).

-   Despite a solid Republican advantage in the district, Crane performed roughly 2.5 percentage points worse than Trump, suggesting some erosion of support within the GOP base or with crossover/independent voters ([Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DHW-R2N1-JBCN-34C5-00000-00&context=1519360); [Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DJP-XY71-JB1V-G1P3-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   His campaign and fundraising drew attacks over the use of outside money and fundraising consultants' backgrounds, which opponents attempted to leverage as character issues or signs of political vulnerability ([Arizona Mirror](https://azmirror.com/briefs/one-of-eli-cranes-fundraising-consultants-was-busted-for-a-meth-lab-in-2016/); [Casa Grande Dispatch](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C3P-RR11-DXVP-T22K-00000-00&context=1519360)).
