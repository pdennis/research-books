# Curriculum, Classroom Policies, and Parental Involvement

### Summary

-   Eli Crane has consistently opposed the teaching of critical race theory (CRT) in schools and government institutions, calling it divisive and harmful ([KNST AM 790, 12/1/21](https://knst.iheart.com/featured/garret-lewis/content/2021-12-01-garret-talks-to-eli-crane-candidate-for-congress-in-cd-1/), [Maricopa Monitor, 7/30/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:638J-HS91-DXVP-V3TY-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He describes CRT as "racist at its core" and sees it as a threat to national unity, warning it could "divide and conquer this nation" if not removed from institutions ([Townhall interview, 7/21/21](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/zachbauder/2021/07/21/congressional-candidate-for-az01-eli-crane-exclusive-interview-with-townhall-n2592827)).

-   During his 2022 campaign, Crane argued that remote learning during the pandemic allowed parents to witness "critical race theory" and "cultural Marxism" being taught, which he claimed mobilized parental opposition ([Copper Courier, 9/21/22](https://coppercourier.com/2022/11/07/5-times-congressional-candidate-eli-crane-campaigned-on-fringe-far-right-conspiracies/)).

-   Crane pledged to support parental involvement in curriculum decisions, positioning himself as a defender of traditional values against progressive educational trends ([Copper Courier, 9/21/22](https://coppercourier.com/2022/11/07/5-times-congressional-candidate-eli-crane-campaigned-on-fringe-far-right-conspiracies/)).

-   Potential vulnerability: The strong focus on eradicating CRT and labeling related curriculum content as "cultural Marxism" could alienate moderate voters or those who support academic freedom and a broad discussion of race in education.
