# Federal Funding and Education Spending

### Summary

-   In 2023, Rep. Eli Crane voted against a resolution to block President Biden's student debt relief program, a stance rated as "wrong" by the AFL-CIO [AFL-CIO scorecard](https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/eli-crane).

-   Crane faced criticism in 2025 for failing to act in support of federal education funding, with constituents expressing concern over inaction on behalf of students during funding cuts [KNAU](https://www.knau.org/knau-and-arizona-news/2025-03-25/frustrated-by-federal-cuts-protesters-call-on-rep-eli-crane-to-hold-public-town-hall).

-   In November 2023, Crane strongly opposed the Department of Education's multi-million dollar fine against Grand Canyon University (GCU), arguing it constituted government overreach and violated religious freedom [Arizona Daily Star](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69M6-WMV1-DXVP-T1DV-00000-00&context=1519360), [Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69N8-2WV1-DXGX-61C7-00000-00&context=1519360).

-   Crane led a joint letter with other Arizona House Republicans urging Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to immediately rescind the GCU fine, highlighting what they viewed as Department of Education overreach and infringements on religious freedom [Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69N8-2WV1-DXGX-61C7-00000-00&context=1519360).

-   Potential vulnerability: Crane's actions and rhetoric around the GCU fine and education funding have drawn criticism from both constituents and labor organizations, exposing him to charges of governmental inaction and prioritization of specific institutional interests over broader student needs [KNAU](https://www.knau.org/knau-and-arizona-news/2025-03-25/frustrated-by-federal-cuts-protesters-call-on-rep-eli-crane-to-hold-public-town-hall), [AFL-CIO scorecard](https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/eli-crane).
