# Election Integrity and Law Enforcement

### Summary

-   Rep. Eli Crane co-sponsored a bill to transfer the Secret Service's non-protective responsibilities to the FBI, aiming to sharpen the agency's focus on protection ([Arizona Republic, 12/7/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DKM-0N61-JB1V-G2XK-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane stated that recent Secret Service failures showed the need for reform, expressing pride in supporting legislation to fix the issue ([Arizona Republic, 12/7/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DKM-0N61-JB1V-G2XK-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The reform bill received public praise from Rep. Matt Gaetz, who called it "very sound legislation" ([Arizona Republic, 12/7/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DKM-0N61-JB1V-G2XK-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane expressed concern over the treatment of some January 6 defendants, stating that political optics led to the mistreatment of many individuals, though he supported holding lawbreakers accountable ([Arizona Daily Star, 1/6/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DV0-M4G3-RSXW-B0DP-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He also supported the idea of case-by-case pardons for January 6 rioters if Trump were to pursue them ([Arizona Daily Star, 1/6/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DV0-M4G3-RSXW-B0DP-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerability: Crane's support for pardoning some January 6 rioters could be used by opponents to question his stance on law enforcement and democratic principles.
