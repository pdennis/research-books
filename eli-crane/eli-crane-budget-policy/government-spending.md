# Government Spending and Appropriations

### Summary

-   Eli Crane consistently opposed major federal spending measures, including COVID-19 stimulus bills, the Inflation Reduction Act, bipartisan budget deals, and continuing resolutions, often citing concerns over national debt and government overreach ([InMaricopa](https://www.inmaricopa.com/crane-says-experience-as-navy-seal-prepared-him-to-be-maricopas-congressman/), [Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65VM-GB51-JB1V-G28T-00000-00&context=1519360), [Cronkite News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68CC-5XC1-DXVP-T3RX-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   As a member of the House Freedom Caucus, Crane repeatedly voted against short-term funding bills and debt ceiling increases, advocating instead for significant spending cuts and a return to regular appropriations processes ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6973-K0X1-DXGX-61K4-00000-00&context=1519360), [AFL-CIO scorecard](https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/eli-crane)).

-   Crane has publicly stated his willingness to risk or accept blame for government shutdowns if they would result in larger spending reductions, asserting that lasting fiscal responsibility requires tough decisions ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6973-K0X1-DXGX-61K4-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He has criticized both Democratic and Republican leadership for what he describes as reckless, debt-increasing spending and has tied this to broader concerns such as inflation and generational financial burdens ([Casa Grande Dispatch](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69BH-SH51-JBCN-30DY-00000-00&context=1519360), [Cronkite News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BM9-WTN1-JBCN-30C9-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   A potential vulnerability for Crane is criticism of his opposition to pandemic relief measures despite his own business benefiting from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), raising questions about consistency ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65VM-GB51-JB1V-G28T-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane has expressed skepticism toward bipartisan deals and claimed that moderate members of his own party undercut efforts for fiscal restraint, even accusing colleagues of "gaslighting" on spending cut commitments ([Arizona Republic](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DS8-5S83-RST7-01J6-00000-00&context=1519360)).
