# Military Aid and Foreign Policy Positions

### Summary

-   Eli Crane voted to cut off all military aid to Ukraine in 2023, which could be viewed as unsupportive of U.S. allies in wartime ([Geneastar](https://en.geneastar.org/genealogy/craneelijah/eli-crane)).

-   He supported a ban on sending cluster munitions to Ukraine, opposing some military assistance measures favored by the administration ([Geneastar](https://en.geneastar.org/genealogy/craneelijah/eli-crane)).

-   In February 2024, Crane publicly criticized Democrats for prioritizing foreign aid over domestic issues, which may paint him as isolationist ([Cronkite News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BDB-W921-JBCN-31BW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   His repeated opposition to Ukraine aid packages places him at odds with members of both parties who support a stronger U.S. role in international security affairs.

-   These stances could be perceived as neglecting U.S. obligations to international partnerships and weakening America's global leadership.
