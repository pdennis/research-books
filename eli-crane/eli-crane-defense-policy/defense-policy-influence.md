# Defense Policy Philosophy and Committee Influence

### Summary

-   Eli Crane's emphasis on military standards over diversity could alienate voters who prioritize inclusion and representation in the armed forces ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/rep-eli-crane-refers-black-americans-colored-people-house-floor-rcna94200)).

-   The proposed amendment to prohibit considering race, gender, religion, or ideology in military decisions may be viewed as minimizing the importance of diversity and equity in the Defense Department ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/rep-eli-crane-refers-black-americans-colored-people-house-floor-rcna94200)).

-   Public focus on China's and Russia's military build-up could be seen as alarmist or overly hawkish by some constituents ([KNST AM 790](https://knst.iheart.com/featured/garret-lewis/content/2021-12-01-garret-talks-to-eli-crane-candidate-for-congress-in-cd-1/)).

-   The narrow House vote (214-210) on Crane's amendment highlights a lack of broad bipartisan support, which may indicate political isolation or vulnerability on defense issues ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/rep-eli-crane-refers-black-americans-colored-people-house-floor-rcna94200)).
