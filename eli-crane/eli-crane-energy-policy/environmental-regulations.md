# Environmental Regulations and Climate Policy

### Summary

-   Rep. Eli Crane has publicly expressed skepticism toward the scientific consensus on climate change, stating, "Just because a scientist says something doesn't mean it's true" ([Arizona Daily Star, 7/17/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CKJ-VF31-JBCN-33TW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane has linked his climate change skepticism to doubts about top scientists' statements on COVID-19 vaccine safety, reflecting broader conservative concerns about scientific authorities ([Arizona Daily Star, 7/17/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CKJ-VF31-JBCN-33TW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Multiple news outlets, including the Arizona Republic and Arizona Daily Star, have identified Crane as a climate change skeptic in 2024 ([Arizona Republic, 9/7/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CX5-9BF1-JB1V-G464-00000-00&context=1519360); [Arizona Daily Star, 9/10/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CXT-WTC1-JBCN-34SS-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Crane opposes new national monument designations in his region, a stance at odds with the support such initiatives have from many local businesses, communities, and sovereign tribes ([Letter to the Editor - Arizona Daily Sun, 9/15/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D04-6FT1-DXVP-T07T-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerability: Crane's public skepticism of both climate science and monument protections may put him at odds with the majority of local stakeholders and the broader scientific community on environmental issues.
