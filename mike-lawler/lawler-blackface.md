## Overview

When Lawler was in college he was [photographed wearing blackface](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/nyregion/lawler-blackface-michael-jackson.html) as part of a [Michael Jackson costume](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/04/mike-lawler-blackface-new-york-00182489). He attended Manhattan College where only three percent of the students were Black and reportedly used bronzer to darken his face for the costume. 

Lawler apologized but claimed his actions were the “sincerest form of flattery” and a “genuine homage to \[his\] musical hero.” Lawler then tried to [make jokes](https://x.com/American_Bridge/status/1849255445862490441) about his actions. 

Lawler had an oddly strong obsession with Michael Jackson. It was reported that in 2005 he [flew to California](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/nyregion/lawler-blackface-michael-jackson.html) to attend part of Michael Jackson’s criminal trial over accusations Jackson molested a young boy. Lawler was [reportedly](https://www.thedailybeast.com/gop-rep-mike-lawler-cant-let-go-of-his-michael-jackson-fandom/) “so disgusted” by the testimony against Jackson that he “couldn’t help but mutter something derogatory under his breath” and was removed from the courtroom.
