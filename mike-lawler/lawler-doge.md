## Lawler Defended DOGE Even Though Its Actions Were Reducing Services At The Social Security Administration

### Lawler Defended DOGE, Calling It “Necessary” And Claiming It Was Finding “Significant Savings”

**Lawler Defended The Trump Administration And The Rapid Pace Of Its Funding Cuts, Calling It “Necessary” And Saying, “Oftentimes When You're Making A, You Know, An Omelet, You've Got To Crack A Few Eggs.”** According to an interview Mike Lawler gave on MSNBC, “LAWLER: What you've seen in the last few weeks, frankly, while some people may object, you certainly understand, Joe. Oftentimes, government moves at a glacial pace. And so, yes, we have seen things move very rapidly, but oftentimes when you're making a, you know, an omelet, you've got to crack a few eggs. And I do think that, unfortunately, is necessary as we're actually trying to uncover what these agencies and departments are doing, what they're spending money on. And is it in keeping with the United States mission?” \[MSNBC, Morning Joe, [2/12/25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV408Y3asNc)\] (video) 

**Lawler Defended DOGE And Claimed It Was Finding “Significant Savings.”** According to a tele-town hall hosted by Rep. Mike Lawler, “LAWLER: I appreciate that. I know there's a lot of focus on the Department of Government Efficiency and the work that is being done within that department and each of the departments and the agencies. So, what how I would explain this is ultimately what you're seeing is a turbo-charged forensic audit of each of these departments and agencies. And in some instances, they are obviously making significant changes or recommendations and or, you know, withholding or pausing large expenditures. In other instances, you know, they are tinkering around the edges. I think as you look through each department and agency, there are significant challenges at hand. \[...\] They are finding significant savings. A lot of the savings thus far have been focused on foreign policy because the president has certain authority within federal law related to foreign policy and related to the expenditure of foreign aid. And so they have across the broad spectrum found well over $100 billion in savings thus far.” \[Rep. Mike Lawler Tele-Town Hall, [3/19/25](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Xvcfhc1fL3A)\] (audio)  

**Lawler Defended The Mission Of DOGE And Said “Something Has To Give” Considering The $36 Trillion In Debt The Country Faced.** According to an interview with Mike Lawler on This Week on ABC News, "LAWLER: But there’s no question, as the Department of Government Efficiency moves ahead, what they are seeking to do is ensure that every agency and department is effectively and efficiently doing their job. With seven -- a $7 trillion budget, there is no question that our government has become bloated and, in many respects, inefficient. And so the task at hand, obviously, for Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, at the direction of President Trump, is to find efficiencies and savings, and make sure that our federal workforce is doing their jobs and doing it effectively. \[…\] When you’re staring down $36 trillion in debt and counting, you know, obviously, something has to -- has to give. And I think that’s what we’re seeing right now, a comprehensive forensic audit of every department and agency in the federal government." \[ABC News, This Week, [2/23/25](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-2-23-25-sen-jack-reed/story?id=119084473)\] (video)
