<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Lawler repeatedly made it “very clear” to New Yorkers that he would not cut Medicare. Then, he <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml">voted</a> for a bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would result in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/">nearly $500 billion</a> in cuts to Medicare, absent future congressional action.</p>
<h2>Lawler Voted For Massive Cuts To Medicare After Promising He Wouldn’t</h2>
<h3>2025: Lawler Voted For House Republicans’ Reconciliation Bill, Which Would Trigger Nearly $500 Billion In Medicare Cuts</h3>
<p><strong>2025: Lawler Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Included $3.8 Trillion In Tax Cuts Offset By $1.5 Trillion In Spending Reductions To Programs Like Medicaid And The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</strong> In May 2025, Lawler voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the bill that would provide for approximately $3.8 trillion in net tax cuts and $321 billion in military, border enforcement and judiciary spending, offset by $1.5 trillion in spending reductions, as instructed in the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). It would raise the statutory debt limit by $4 trillion and provide for increased spending on defense and border security, spending cuts on social safety net programs, such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It also includes a mix of tax breaks for businesses and individuals; tax increases on universities and foundations; and a phase-down of clean energy tax credits. […] It would reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by requiring states to shoulder more of the cost, expand work requirements for SNAP, extend programs authorized under the 2018 farm bill, and prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Program. As amended, it would cap state and local tax deductions at $40,000 for households with incomes below $500,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 215 to 214.

  <li><strong>Congressional Budget Office Estimated That The House Republican Reconciliation Bill Would Trigger Nearly $500 Billion In Cuts To Medicare.</strong>&nbsp;According to a letter the Congressional Budget Office sent to Rep. Brendan Boyle, "Today the Congressional Budget Office transmitted an estimate of the budgetary effects of the 2025 reconciliation bill, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Budget on May 18, 2025. 1 CBO has not yet completed estimates of the effects of interactions among the titles of the legislation. This letter responds to your questions concerning the sequestration (the cancellation of budgetary resources) in accordance with the Statutory Pay‑As‑You‑Go Act of 2010 (S-PAYGO) that would occur if an enacted bill raised deficits by $2.3 trillion over 10 years. Under S-PAYGO, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is required to maintain 5- and 10-year scorecards that it updates with the estimated cumulative changes in revenues and outlays generated by newly enacted legislation. […] The 4 percent maximum reduction in Medicare spending would apply to sequestration orders for years after 2026. If OMB ordered a sequestration of $230 billion for each year through 2034, the ordered reductions in Medicare spending would increase to about $75 billion in 2034 and would total roughly $490 billion over the 2027–2034 period."

<p><strong>July 2025: Lawler Voted For The Senate FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Extended $4 Trillion In Expiring Tax Cuts, Added New Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025, Lawler voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, the “motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214.

<h3>Before Voting To Cut Medicare, Lawler Repeatedly Made It “Very Clear” That He Would Not Cut Medicare</h3>
<p><strong>Lawler: “I've Been Very Clear That I Am Not Cutting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid Benefits To Anyone.”</strong>&nbsp;According to an interview Rep. Mike Lawler gave on Fox News Rundown, “HOST: You know, Democrats oppose all this, and they have said that you can't just find cuts in the budget through waste, fraud and abuse. You're going to have to make cuts to Medicare and Social Security and Medicaid. That's what they say is going to happen. What, what do you say when you hear that? LAWLER: Well, number one, they're lying because, first of all, Social Security cannot be touched as part of reconciliation. It's very clear. And so when they say things like that, it's just obvious they're attempting to scare people and not actually engage in a constructive dialogue. Number two, I've been very clear that I am not cutting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid benefits to anyone. The fact is, people rely on Medicaid, for instance. Those in the community are seniors, you know, children, single mothers. The fact is they need these vital programs and we want to make sure that they are there for them.” [Fox News Rundown, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/mike-lawler-fox-news-rundown-42225/s-vuDJi5m4NAC?si=f5098f09badd4352b1403e1465ea1ccb&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">4/22/25</a>] (audio)</p>

  <li><strong>Lawler: “So When People Say, ‘Oh, They're Cutting Social Security Or They're Cutting Medicare,’ That Is A Lie, Period. We Are Not Cutting Social Security Or Medicare.”</strong> According to a town hall hosted by Rep. Mike Lawler, “LAWLER: Now, when it comes to Social Security and Medicare, there have been no cuts. Nobody has received a cut in benefits. There's not a single person in this room that is on Social Security or Medicare that can honestly stand here and say that they have received a cut because you haven’t. Now, with respect to- with respect to Social Security, sir, just yelling out is not going to change anything, alright? You're interrupting everybody else. So enough. The fact is that during my time in Congress, I have fought to protect Social Security and Medicare. I helped pass the Social Security Fairness Act so that people who for the last 40 years have been getting screwed because they had a pension and they were losing Social Security benefits, they now get those benefits because I fought to get that done. So when people say, ‘Oh, they're cutting Social Security or they're cutting Medicare,’ that is a lie, period. We are not cutting Social Security or Medicare.” [Rep. Mike Lawler Town Hall, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeIV74HkTPk">4/27/25</a>] (video)</li>

<p><strong>Lawler: “I've Been Very Clear That I Will Not Cut Social Security Or Medicare In Any Way Impact Those Programs That People Have Paid Into For Decades, That Have Planned For As Part Of Their Retirement, And Make Sure That They Have The Support And Resources That They Need.”</strong> According to a tele-town hall hosted by Rep. Mike Lawler, “LAWLER: Number one, I've been very clear that I will not cut Social Security or Medicare in any way impact those programs that people have paid into for decades, that have planned for as part of their retirement, and make sure that they have the support and resources that they need.” [Rep.

<p><strong>Lawler: “I've Been Very Clear. I Will Not Cut Social Security, Medicare Or Medicaid. The Fact Is That These Programs Are Vital To Folks All Across Our Country And They've Paid Into Them.”</strong> According to an interview Mike Lawler gave on Fox Business, “BARTIROMO: House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries claims she will explain how Democrats are fighting to protect Social Security and Medicaid. And the Republicans are fighting to lower taxes for Elon Musk and other billionaires. You've been pushing back on the Democrats narrative about the budget. Give us your take. LAWLER: Well, this is typical of the Democrats. They just lie and make things up. I've been very clear. I will not cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. The fact is that these programs are vital to folks all across our country and they've paid into them. But we have a $7 trillion budget, $36 trillion in debt. We have to rein in the size and scope of the federal government.” [Fox Business, Mornings with Maria, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fztyB7tAXZM">3/3/25</a>] (video)</p>
