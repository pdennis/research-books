<h2>Lawler Was The Deciding Vote To Protect Trump’s Tariffs Despite Acknowledging The Harm They Were Causing To New Yorkers</h2>
<h3>Lawler Has Repeatedly Defended Trump’s Tariffs And Handling Of The Economy</h3>
<p><strong>Lawler Defended Trump’s Tariffs And Claimed They Were A “Very Effective” Negotiating Tool.</strong>&nbsp;According to an interview Mike Lawler gave on CNN, "REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): Well, as I said, when the president announced these tariffs way back in April, that as a short-term negotiating tool, this could be very effective. And what we have already seen with Japan, with China, with Vietnam, with Thailand, with the E.U., is massive trade deals, trillions of dollars of investment into the United States, that, by the way, would not have happened, but for using the leverage of tariffs to force these countries to negotiate better trade deals. PHILLIP: I think that is very debatable. I just want to point out that many people -- LAWLER: Where do you think these trade deals came from?&nbsp; PHILLIP: Well, no. Many people question whether the investment will happen and whether the investment is actually real, or whether they're counting investments that were already going to happen. They're -- it's funny -- some of it could be funny math.&nbsp; So, let's just leave it at –" [CNN, Newsnight, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEUAt6QyeJ0">7/31/25</a>] (video)</p>
<p><strong>Lawler Claimed Trump’s Tariffs Paired With House Republicans’ Tax Giveaways To The Wealthy Would Cause The Economy To “Take Off.”</strong>&nbsp;According to an interview Mike Lawler gave on CNN, “LAWLER: Well, look, as I've said from the very beginning, I think the tariffs are meant to be a short term negotiating tool to negotiate with countries like Japan, like Korea, like India, like the EU, Canada, Mexico and yes, China to get better and fairer trade deals for the United States, to bring down barriers to entry to U.S. goods in those countries, as well as to eliminate things like price controls that Europe has on US prescription drugs, which, by the way, means that we are paying higher drug costs to subsidize Europe. So I think the objective was always in large measure to force renegotiation and get better trade deals. Obviously, and I met with many folks, including, you know, economists from Deutsche Bank, for instance, earlier this week, as well as retail giants like Wal-Mart last week. Of course, there is concern about some of the short term, you know, challenges as a result of this back and forth. But I think the long term objective here, especially if the president is able to get agreements and we saw yesterday the vice president speak out with respect to India, if we're able to get these agreements turned around quickly within the next 30 days or so and you get the tax reconciliation bill done, as I've said for from the beginning, the economy is going to take off and that will be extremely good for every American.” [CNN, The Lead, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5uVeAuCYC0">4/23/25</a>] (video)</p>
<p><strong>4/27/25: Lawler Defended Trump’s Chaotic Handling Of The Economy As Benefiting The U.S. In The Long-Term.</strong>&nbsp;According to an interview Rep. Mike Lawler did on CNN, “ANCHOR: Yeah, and that's just my last question, is that there are going to be, right now people are going to be paying higher prices. The economists, leading economists and the Fed chairman, they're all concerned that the current policies are going to lead to either stagflation or higher inflation. LAWLER: Well, you've already seen grocery prices come down. Cost of eggs, for instance, came down significantly. Gas prices came down. You saw real wage growth higher than inflation for the month of March. So, look, the economy is moving, but we obviously want to make sure that it is strong for every middle class, hard-working American family in this country. And that is why we are fighting so hard to get trade deals that benefit the American people, that bring back jobs and manufacturing and investment in the United States. You saw already the president announced over $4 trillion in new economic investment from foreign companies and countries. That is a positive for the economy. Yes, there's going to be a little short term volatility, but long term, we are going to be in a much stronger position, especially when we get the tax bill done under reconciliation.” [CNN, Newsroom,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WgZookCYwo">4/27/25</a>] (video)</p>

MOSKOWITZ: It’s going great, the penguins are happy. LAWLER: No, look, the issue on tariffs is we have had a trade deficit for a very long time. And countries like Japan, like India, countries in the EU are, who are our allies have been putting in place tariffs, price controls and barriers to entry to US goods and products. And the fact is we need to eliminate that trade deficit. We need to bring back jobs in manufacturing and investment. And President Trump has already announced over 5 trillion in new investment in the U.S. economy.” [CNN, The Source,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz5Noge1LWM">4/30/25</a>] (video)</li>

<p><strong>Lawler On Trump’s Tariffs: “President Trump Is Effectively Using Tariffs As A Negotiating Tool To Force Canada And Mexico To Act On Issues Of Paramount National Security Importance To The United States.”</strong>&nbsp;According to Politico, "But Republicans at the Conservative Party gathering today saw the subsequent deal between the U.S. and Mexico to delay the 25 percent tariff for a month as a sign of Trump’s negotiating prowess. ‘President Trump is effectively using tariffs as a negotiating tool to force Canada and Mexico to act on issues of paramount national security importance to the United States — including cracking down on the flow of immigration, stopping the flow of those on the terror watch list and stopping the flow of illicit drugs into the United States,’ Lawler said."

<h3>Lawler Admitted That Trump’s Tariffs Would Harm New Yorkers</h3>
<p><strong>Lawler Acknowledged That Trump’s Tariffs Would Cause “Pain” For Americans.</strong>&nbsp;According to an interview Rep. Mike Lawler gave on NewsNation, “ANCHOR: And, Congressman, you also served on the House Financial Services Committee. We saw a lot of movement this week on tariffs. Just breaking down the numbers for our viewers, 25% tariffs took effect on Tuesday for Mexico and Canada. Does not apply to the goods covered by the USMCA trade agreement. We're just two weeks away from that April 2nd deadline for these tariffs to expand to all goods. What do you say to people in your district who are concerned this is going to hurt them financially?&nbsp; […] LAWLER: So the bottom line is, yes, obviously, there may be a little bit of short term, you know, pain here. But the objective long term is to actually have fair trade that reduces costs, reduces price, and brings jobs back to the United States.” [NewsNation, Morning in America, <a href="https://x.com/American_Bridge/status/1920193552820129969">3/16/25</a>] (video)</p>
<h3>Lawler Repeatedly Voted To Protect Trump’s Tariffs</h3>
<h4>September 2025: Lawler Voted To Protect Trump’s Tariffs</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Lawler Effectively Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through March 2026.</strong> In September 2025, Lawler voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the resolution [that] would allow for the tolling (the pausing of counting) of days for resolutions of inquiry from Sept. 30, 2025 through March 31, 2026. It also would provide that each day during the period from April 9, 2025, through March 31, 2026. would not constitute a calendar day for the purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution to terminate President Donald Trump's April 2, 2025 executive order declaring a national emergency regarding tariffs on imported goods. The resolution also would provide that during the period for March 11, 2025 through March 31, 2026, would not constitute a calendar day for purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution terminating a national emergency executive order declared by President Trump on Feb. 1, 2025. Such an executive order concerned tariffs on many Canadian and Mexican imports and Chinese goods. The resolution also would provide that the provisions of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act would not apply through March 31, 2026 to a joint resolution terminating the national emergency.” The vote was on the rule. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 213 to 211.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Support Was Won From GOP Holdouts Through A Promise Of A Vote Later In The Week To Shorten The Block To End In January Rather Than March.</strong>&nbsp;According to Politico, “GOP leaders flipped several of the Republican holdouts with a promise to add language shortening the block on tariff disapproval votes to a forthcoming measure set for approval later in the week, per two Republicans with direct knowledge of the agreement. The expiration date on the block will be reset from March 31 to the end of January, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Tuesday. It’s likely the Supreme Court will have ruled on a challenge to Trump’s tariff-declaring powers by then.” [Politico,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/16/congress/house-again-votes-to-surrender-tariff-powers-to-trump-00566975">9/16/25</a>]</li>

<h4>April 2025: Lawler Was The Deciding Vote To Protect Trump’s Tariffs</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Lawler Cast The Deciding Vote For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through September 2025.</strong>&nbsp;In April 2025, Lawler voted for, “adoption of the rule (H Res 313) that would provide for floor consideration of the Senate amendment to the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). The rule would provide up to one hour of debate on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the measure. It also would block the expedited consideration of joint resolutions terminating President Donald Trump’s tariff actions under the April 2 executive order by providing that each day during the period from April 9, 2025 through Sept. 30, 2025, will not constitute a calendar day under the federal law pertaining to terminating national emergencies.” The vote was on the rule. The underlying legislation was the FY 2025 budget resolution. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 216 to 215.

  <li><strong>Speaker Johnson Backed The Move, Claiming Trump Has “Executive Authority” And That The Tariffs Are “In The Interest Of The American People.”</strong>&nbsp;According to ABC News, “House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., defended the move, telling reporters, ‘I've made it very clear I think the president has executive authority. It's an appropriate level of authority to deal with the unfair trade practices. That's part of the role of the president is to negotiate with other countries.’ Johnson said Trump told him Tuesday night that ‘there are almost 70 countries that are [in] some stage in negotiation of more fair-trade agreement agreements with the United States. I think that is in the interest of the American people. I think that is an ‘America First’ policy that will be effective, and so we have to give them the space to do it.’” [ABC News,&nbsp;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-gop-moves-prevent-votes-rescinding-trump-tariffs/story?id=120644968">4/9/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Vote Was The Second Use Of The Procedural Tactic To Block Votes On The Tariffs, The First Use Of It Being In March.</strong>&nbsp;According to ABC News, “House Democrats, led by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., moved to force a vote on Tuesday on terminating the national emergency authority and blocking Trump's sweeping tariffs. Now, that vote is unlikely to occur. This is the second time Johnson has moved to stop the legislative calendar to prevent votes on Trump's authority on tariffs. Under House rules, these votes would typically come up within 15 calendar days but now will not if the ‘rule’ passes during the vote series Wednesday afternoon.” [ABC News,&nbsp;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-gop-moves-prevent-votes-rescinding-trump-tariffs/story?id=120644968">4/9/25</a>]</li>

<h4>April 2025: Lawler Voted To Protect Trump’s Tariffs</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Lawler Effectively Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through September 2025.</strong>&nbsp;In April 2025, Lawler voted for, “motion to order the previous question (thus ending debate and possibility of amendment) on the rule (H Res 313) that would providing for floor consideration of the Senate amendment to the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). The rule would provide up to one hour of debate on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the measure. It also would block the expedited consideration of joint resolutions terminating President Donald Trump’s tariff actions under the April 2 executive order by providing that each day during the period from April 9, 2025 through Sept. 30, 2025, will not constitute a calendar day under the federal law pertaining to terminating national emergencies.” The vote was on the previous question. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 217 to 212.

<p><strong>2025: Lawler Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs.</strong>&nbsp;In March 2025, Lawler voted for, “the bill that would provide for Congressional disapproval of, and nullify, a December 2024 IRS rule related to gross proceeds reporting by brokers involved in digital asset sales.

  <li><strong>The Bill Effectively Blocked The House From Voting To Reverse Trump’s Tariffs On Mexico, Canada, And China For The Next Year.</strong>&nbsp;According to the New York Times, “Republican leaders on Tuesday slipped language into a procedural measure that would prevent any resolution to end the tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China from receiving a vote this year. It passed on party lines as part of a resolution that cleared the way for a vote later Tuesday on a government spending bill needed to prevent a shutdown at the end of the week.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html">3/11/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Bill Nullified A Law That Would Allow The House And Senate To End A Disaster Declared By The President.</strong> According to the New York Times, “In this case, Republican leaders did so using a particularly unusual contortion: They essentially declared the rest of the year one long day, nullifying a law that allows the House and Senate to jointly put an end to a disaster declared by the president.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html">3/11/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The National Emergencies Act Required Consideration Of Resolutions Ending A Presidentially Declared Emergency Within Fifteen Calendar Days But Republican Leadership Included A Measure In The Bill Declaring The Rest Of The Year Did Not Constitute A Calendar Day.</strong> According to the New York Times, “The national emergency law lays out a fast-track process for Congress to consider a resolution ending a presidential emergency, requiring committee consideration within 15 calendar days after one is introduced and a floor vote within three days after that. But the language House Republicans inserted in their measure on Tuesday declared that, ‘Each day for the remainder of the 119th Congress shall not constitute a calendar day’ for the purposes of the emergency that Mr. Trump declared on Feb. 1.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html">3/11/25</a>]</li>

<p><strong>Ollie’s Pizza In High Falls, NY Said It Was Experiencing Supply Chain Disruptions In Their Restaurant Group As A Result Of Trump’s Tariffs.</strong>&nbsp;According to Chronogram, "‘The uncertainty is almost as much of a killer as something that's real,’ says Innis Lawrence, co-owner of the Ollie’s Group, which owns Ollie’s Pizza in High Falls, as well as Ollie’s Slice Shop, Eliza, Fletcher &amp; Lu, and Kingston Wine Co. in Kingston. ‘No one is willing to make a move because we don't know what's coming down the pipeline.’ Lawrence and his business partners are seeing supply chain disruptions in their restaurant group crop up in places small (previously reliable orders for everything from labels and latex gloves are delayed) and large. ‘Europe is essentially not shipping wine to the US right now,’ he says.&nbsp; With the 10 percent base tariff in place and Trump previously floating the idea of a 200 percent tariff on European wine, champagne, and spirits, Lawrence says that importers and exporters alike are spooked. On average, it takes six to eight weeks for wine to make its way to the US on a cargo ship, raising the specter that new tariffs could be enacted before a shipment even arrives at port."

<p><strong>Clothing Store Owner Who Sold Scrubs To Hospital Workers And Uniforms For Local Schools Said He Might Have To Raise Prices In Order To Keep His Business Afloat Because Of Trump’s Tariffs.</strong>&nbsp;According to North Country Public Radio, "Embroidered polo shirts have been $11.99 at Jack Yonally’s clothing store for the last eight years. Men’s underwear sell for $8.99.&nbsp;Yonally said those competitive prices have kept B. Lodge and Company in business since 1867, when it first opened its doors in downtown Albany.&nbsp; ‘I have customers that come in, and they might be in their 90s, and they say, ‘Well, since I was a little girl, I've shopped here. My mother used to bring me in here,’ he said. ‘That is very rewarding.’ […] And Yonally has been holding his breath in recent weeks. In gearing up for fall shopping, Yonally tried to make some more orders that would arrive later in the summer. But his vendors told him there was a problem.&nbsp; ‘One of my main resources that I ordered from said, ‘Jack, I can hold prices through the end of April. I have stock in this country. I can't promise after that, because I don't know,’ Yonally said.&nbsp; He said he hates the idea of raising prices. He sells scrubs to hospital workers in the Capitol Region and offers student uniforms for nearly 30 public, charter and parochial schools. With his business surpluses, Yonally said he’s been able to donate 8,500 winter jackets each year to those in need.&nbsp; But if he wants to stay afloat, he said, he might have to implement a price hike. ‘I don't want to have customers coming in here where I have to have (them) at $14.99,’ Yonally said of his embroidered polo shirts. ‘Because all I'll hear from them is, ‘Why?’" [North Country Public Radio, <a href="https://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/story/51633/20250424/new-york-businesses-are-beginning-to-see-the-effects-of-trump-s-tariffs">4/24/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>Fireworks Company Owner Said He Would Have To Add A Surcharge To His Fireworks Shows Because Of Trump’s Tariffs.</strong>&nbsp;According to North Country Public Radio, "Jim Young owns Young Explosives, a fireworks company in Canandaigua. He said given the current financial instability, he is planning on adding a surcharge to fireworks shows his company puts on for towns across the state. Like most other U.S. fireworks companies, Young Explosives orders about 80% of its fireworks from China, which has a stronghold over the pyrotechnics industry globally.&nbsp; Because of China’s dominance in the sector, Young and other fireworks companies say one of the most patriotic events in the country - Fourth of July fireworks shows - stand to be affected.&nbsp; Young had recently ordered three shipments from factories there. One hit American soil right as the first wave of tariffs kicked in. It came with a 25% tariff. He put another shipment on hold because of the financial uncertainty. The last shipment is already en route, set to arrive in the summer, so it was too late for him to cancel the order. He has no idea what tariff will get slapped onto that.&nbsp; ‘It's going to be a pretty big financial hit, which, unfortunately, will roll over to communities that I do business with,’ Young said.&nbsp; Young, whose company puts on about 500 events each year, said he hasn’t figured out how to break the news to his clients.&nbsp; ‘I've wrestled with what I want to say, because I feel bad having to tell people,’ Young said.&nbsp; These import taxes aren’t a surprise. Young, who voted for Trump, said he expected the tariffs would come eventually, seeing how much Trump talked about them on the campaign trail."
