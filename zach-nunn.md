# **How to win against Zach Nunn**

Nunn isn’t working for IA-03. He backed taking health care from thousands of Iowans, defended Trump tariffs that hit Iowa pocketbooks and farms as “winning,” cheered Trump-era cuts that worsened Social Security services, opposed once-in-a-generation bridge repair funding that Iowa needed, and chose Big Pharma over lower drug costs. That’s a clear pattern: cuts to care, higher costs, fewer services, and excuses instead of results for Iowans.

### nunn voted for devastating medicaid cuts

-   Nunn [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that was estimated to kick [17 million](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) Americans off their health insurance, including nearly [12 million](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) Americans who rely on Medicaid. Nunn had previously claimed he was [“fully committed”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJBznhLkFyI) to protecting Medicaid. An estimated [27,293 Iowans](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) could lose their health insurance as a result of his vote.

**Message:** Nunn broke his promise to protect Iowans’ health care all to pay for billionaire tax credits.

### nunn spent thousands of taxpayer dollars promoting his votes that took health care from iowans

-   After voting to cut health care and food assistance for Iowans, Zach Nunn cut [“slick”](https://thehill.com/homenews/5464931-zach-nunn-promotes-trump-tax-bill/) [digital ads](https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/08/21/nunn-touts-big-beautiful-laws-tax-cuts-in-new-ad-prompting-democrat-criticism/) using taxpayer-funds promoting his support of the bill that made the cuts. In total he spent $12,000 of Iowan’s hard-earned taxpayer money on the ads. The Hill noted that the ads, despite being made by his official office, had [“more of a campaign ad feel”](https://thehill.com/homenews/5464931-zach-nunn-promotes-trump-tax-bill/) from their production.
-   One of the ads [featured](https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/08/21/nunn-touts-big-beautiful-laws-tax-cuts-in-new-ad-prompting-democrat-criticism/) a woman who did not live in Nunn’s district and who worked for Iowans for Tax Relief, a group whose PAC had donated to Nunn’s state legislative campaigns.

**Message:** Nunn spent taxpayer money promoting himself while Iowans lost their jobs and health care.

### NUNN VOTED FOR MASSIVE CUTS TO MEDICARE

- Nunn [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml) for a bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would trigger [nearly $500 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare absent future congressional action.

**Message**: Nunn voted to make massive cuts to health care services seniors rely on all to give tax breaks to billionaires.

### nunn chose big pharma over cheaper prescription drugs for iowa seniors

-   Nunn [opposed](https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/08/20/political-soapbox-whos-speaking-at-the-iowa-state-fair/) the Inflation Reduction Act, which [lowered prescription drugs costs](https://www.hhs.gov/inflation-reduction-act/index.html) and capped the [cost of insulin at $35 per month](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-facts-about-the-35-insulin-copay-cap-in-medicare/) for seniors. [More than 88,000 Iowans](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ira-rx-prices-iowa.pdf) on Medicare took prescription drugs that were selected for price negotiation under the Inflation Reduction Act’s provisions.

**Message:** Nunn chose Big Pharma over lowering prescription drug costs for Iowa seniors.

### nunn was the deciding vote to protect trump’s tariffs

-   Nunn has described Trump’s tariffs as [“winning”](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/25/zach-nunn-talks-taxes-tariffs-and-more-at-westside-conservatives-club/83231764007/) even though an Iowa economist warned [“we’re all going to be poorer.”](https://www.thegazette.com/article/iowa-state-economist-on-trump-tariff-policies-were-all-going-to-be-poorer/)
-   He voted four times to protect the tariffs, including in April 2025 when he was the [deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect tariffs from being repealed by Congress, dooming Iowans who relied on her to a [trade war](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/business/soy-farmers-struggle-with-trade-war.html) and rising prices. Tariffs are contributing to [higher food prices](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi), [higher costs for researchers](https://www.kcrg.com/2025/05/10/university-iowa-engineering-students-learn-firsthand-about-impacts-tariffs/), and [hurting Iowa farmers](https://www.iasoybeans.com/newsroom/article/us-soybean-farmers-sound-alarm-as-china-turns-to-brazil-amid-trade-standoff).

**Message:** Higher prices, crops sitting in storage, lost income for farmers – Nunn chose Trump’s trade war over protecting affordability and Iowans’ livelihoods.

### nunn defended trump’s cuts even though they were disrupting social security

-   Nunn claimed “the American dream was alive and well under Trump” even though DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) [ability](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/) to [deliver services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. More than [157,328 Iowans](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/ia.pdf) in Nunn’s district relied on Social Security benefits.

**Message:** Nunn cheered cuts that meant slower services and less help for Iowa seniors.


### nunn opposed a bipartisan effort to repair bridges in iowa

-   Nunn claimed the [Bipartisan Infrastructure Law](https://www.ottumwacourier.com/news/nunn-focuses-on-urban-rural-balance/article_f94e7384-b9b3-11ec-bcb9-f722e250a7c3.html) was an example of how [“Washington has really forgotten the heartland”](https://www.crestonnews.com/adair-county-free-press/2021/11/24/us-congress-hopeful-zach-nunn-campaigns-in-greenfield/) even though Iowa was set to [receive billions of dollars](https://www.axios.com/local/des-moines/2021/11/16/biden-infrastructure-bill-iowa-roads-bridge-repairs) to repair bridges, roads, and for broadband development projects. That was something Iowa desperately needed as it was [ranked as the number one state](https://artbabridgereport.org/) with the largest number of bridges in poor condition.

**Message:** Nunn isn’t interested in building any bridges, politically or physically.

### It took Nunn 11 months to vote to release the epstein files and he did only after trump gave permission

- 	In November 2025, after 11 months, Nunn finally [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml) to release the Epstein files, but only after [Donald Trump gave House Republicans permission](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115562626931599548) to do so. Previoulsy, Nunn had [cast the deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml) against [releasing the Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj), protecting the accused pedophiles named within. Nunn never [signed](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209) the discharge petition that called for the files' release and he never [co-sponsored](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581/cosponsors?pageSort=alphaByParty) Rep. Thomas Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna's resolution that called for their release.   

**Message:** Nunn can't be trusted to hold accused pedophiles named in the Epstein files accountable, he'll fall in line with whatever Trump wants him to do.
