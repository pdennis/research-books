<h2>Garrity Would Allow Trump To Overstep His Authority And Deploy The National Guard Against Pennsylvanians</h2>
<h3>Garrity Said She Would Be Open To Trump Sending The National Guard To Philadelphia</h3>
<p><strong>September 2025: Garrity Said She Would Be Open To Trump Sending The National Guard To Philadelphia Because The City Had “Another Shooting […] Every Other Day.”&nbsp;</strong>According to Garrity in an interview with CBS 21, “INTERVIEWER: The federal government, led by Donald Trump, has said we want to put National Guard troops in some of these cities that need some help or have some crime numbers they don't like. Would you, as governor, welcome in that help to cities like Philadelphia or Harrisburg? GARRITY: I'm not so sure that we need that in Harrisburg. Philadelphia? Look, I think parents want to know that their kids can be out on the streets or playing in playgrounds without worrying about their safety. And so Philadelphia, it seems like they have a, you know, another shooting there, you know, every other day. So Philadelphia, I think, could use something, whether it's us, you know, as a state, beefing up our police force or it's help from the feds. You know, I'd be open to whatever it takes to make our community safe.” [Stacy Garrity Interview – CBS 21, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bfOEcDjAt4">9/1/25</a>] (VIDEO)&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Trump Was Deploying The National Guard In American Cities Without The Consent Of Governors, Infringing Upon States’ Rights</h3>
<p><strong>October 2025: Pennsylvania Joined Several States In A Lawsuit Against Trump’s Deployments Of National Guard Troops In American Cities Without The Consent Of Governors, Arguing It Was An “Incredibly Dangerous And An Unprecedented Infringement On States’ Rights.”</strong> According to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star, “Pennsylvania has joined several states taking legal action against President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in U.S. cities, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced on Wednesday night.&nbsp;‘Deploying the National Guard to patrol American cities over the wishes of their governors is incredibly dangerous and an unprecedented infringement on states’ rights,’ Shapiro wrote on social media. ‘Pennsylvania just took legal action to support our fellow states and put an end to the dangerous overreach of power we are seeing with Donald Trump’s Guard deployments.’ [Pennsylvania Capital-Star, <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/pennsylvania-joins-multi-state-lawsuit-over-trump-deploying-national-guard-in-cities/">10/9/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>September 2025: After Trump Deployed The National Guard In Los Angeles, D.C., And Memphis, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner Held Town Halls To Advice Citizens What They Should Do In The Event That Trump Deployed Troops In Philadelphia Under The Guise Of Combatting Crime.</strong> According to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star, “Since being sworn in for a second term, President Donald Trump has deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles and Washington D.C., and more are on their way to Memphis, Tennessee, as part of what he said is an effort to restore law and order.&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent weeks, Gov. Josh Shapiro has faced questions about how Pennsylvania would respond if the president turned his attention to Philadelphia.&nbsp;&nbsp;Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has been outspoken on the issue. His office held three public events last week to provide advice for what citizens should do, while also sharply criticizing the president’s approach. […] The events were billed as the ‘Be the Light and Bring the Light’ town halls, taking place on three straight nights in different neighborhoods in Philadelphia. Each event ended with Krasner responding to some of the questions submitted via card by audience members.&nbsp;&nbsp;Krasner said that Trump’s claims of crime being out of control in several big cities, like Philadelphia, were off base. He said he believes there is a different reason.” [Pennsylvania Capital-Star, <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/philadelphia-da-krasner-talks-national-guard-ice-and-trump-during-series-of-town-halls/">9/22/25</a>]</p>
