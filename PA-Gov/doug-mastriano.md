# How To Win Against Doug Mastriano

Doug Mastriano would not fight for Pennsylvanians, but instead would continue to further his and Trump’s extreme agenda. Mastriano could not be trusted to protect Pennsylvanians’ access to health care due to his opposition to the Affordable Care Act and plans that threatened Medicaid funding. Mastriano previously called for the suspension of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and threatened the confidentiality protections of medical patients. Mastriano supported Trump’s devastating tariffs that were harming Pennsylvania small businesses and increasing costs. He wanted to create a Pennsylvania DOGE, even as Trump’s DOGE cuts were affecting Social Security recipients; defunding Pennsylvania universities, farmers, and food banks; and federal workers in Pennsylvania were losing their jobs. Mastriano opposed clean energy tax credits that were meant to support clean energy jobs in Pennsylvania, and he supported legislative measures that harmed Pennsylvania’s environment. Mastriano was an anti-abortion extremist, sponsoring an extreme abortion ban without exceptions that would charge women with murder for abortions later in pregnancy. Mastriano, who spread baseless claims of voter fraud, supported measures to restrict voting rights that could result in the disenfranchisement of many Pennsylvanians. Mastriano faced several scandals over his election denialism, far-right extremism, and academic integrity. Mastriano was a January 6 insurrectionist who was investigated and subpoenaed for his involvement in the insurrection, sending fake electors, and trying to overturn the 2020 election. Mastriano was a Christian Nationalist and far-right extremist who made antisemitic remarks, posted Islamophobic content, and promoted QAnon conspiracies. Mastriano’s doctoral research was scrutinized for being “atrocious” and “dishonest,” historians criticized his published book for being inaccurate, and he received backlash over his academic papers justifying civilian deaths. 

### Mastriano Opposed The Affordable Care Act And Threatened Medicaid Funding

-   Mastriano mocked the Affordable Care Act, even though it allowed Pennsylvania to [expand](https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/medicaid-expansion-frequently-asked-questions-0) Medicaid and increase access to health care. Mastriano [compared](https://www.facebook.com/Fight4pa/posts/pfbid0eh2Gt6UrfGnBiTBzQWFLxWeVwb9Nhtw4FGm4yw1bxRArc6pbDsqTopyCJUQcsmel) the federal health care law to socialism and shared a post [claiming](https://www.facebook.com/Fight4pa/posts/pfbid0Y1hmzuCLpWEmDHb45DyJU8EQFudZWtdkZWaemzo8rtGSLrirTHaLzKps91ShuDbZl) it “fined” Americans “for not buying health insurance.” More than [496,000 Pennsylvanians](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/marketplace-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=0&selectedRows=%7B%22states%22:%7B%22pennsylvania%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) were enrolled in Affordable Care Act Marketplace health insurance plans. 
-   Mastriano previously announced a plan to [cut Medicaid funds](https://twitter.com/dougmastriano/status/1578428739527925762/photo/3) in order to pay for the expansion of nursing homes, even though nearly [3 million Pennsylvanians](https://files.kff.org/attachment/fact-sheet-medicaid-state-PA) rely on Medicaid. 

**Message:** Mastriano could not be trusted to protect Pennsylvanians’ access to health care.

### Mastriano Threatened The Privacy Rights Of Medical Patients

-   Prior to becoming a COVID-19 skeptic, Mastriano threatened the privacy rights of medical patients. In March 2020, Mastriano [proposed](https://www.penncapital-star.com/election-2022/now-a-defender-of-personal-freedom-mastriano-wanted-to-lift-privacy-rules-in-pandemics-early-days/) for the state and federal government to roll back medical privacy protections for COVID-19 patients. Mastriano [proposed a measure to suspend HIPAA,](https://web.archive.org/web/20200319030536/https:/senatormastriano.com/2020/03/17/mastriano-federal-hipaa-regs-should-be-suspended-during-coronavirus-pandemic/) chastised the federal government for “not proactively” rolling back medical privacy protections, and called HIPAA a “dangerous policy.” He also [urged](https://penncapital-star.com/election-2022/now-a-defender-of-personal-freedom-mastriano-wanted-to-lift-privacy-rules-in-pandemics-early-days/) Trump to suspend the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and called for legislation to eliminate confidentiality protections in Pennsylvania.

**Message:** Mastriano threatened the confidentiality protections of medical patients.

### Mastriano Supported TRUMP’S Devastating TARIFFS

-   In 2025, Mastriano [supported](https://www.facebook.com/Fight4pa/posts/pfbid024TrEiSmcQtDwXpi5to48cpTXA2dvE4p1DkDdTAyH1ysbXNPCQsqmPDWqm9iBfcMVl) Trump’s tariffs, which were dooming Pennsylvanians to a trade war and [rising prices](https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/garrity-and-meuser-bring-potential-gubernatorial-pitches-to-conservative-conference/). 
-   Tariffs are contributing to [higher food prices](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi) and are [hurting](https://www.fox43.com/article/news/local/small-businesses-worry-about-tariffs-impacting-the-holiday-shopping-season-holidays-lancaster-county/521-0afe4a32-8fe3-48e0-b220-20a4ca14608c) Pennsylvania small businesses and families. From January to May 2025, Pennsylvanians faced an estimated cost of [$1.6 billion](https://www.axios.com/local/pittsburgh/2025/07/16/1-6-billion-tariff-impacts-on-pennsylvania) in tariffs. Despite this, Mastriano called Trump’s tariffs [“‘reciprocal’ to level the playing field,”](https://www.facebook.com/SenatorDougMastriano/posts/pfbid0JGaYudPLeUcJ8LFtxzdPvmibraYwupkYLjJsVabL7UCAD3NBxGbvTPY9W8fo8T51l) even as the [U.S. stock market crashed](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/04/nx-s1-5352362/markets-selloff-dow-trump-tariffs) due to Trump’s escalating global trade war.

**Message:** Mastriano supported Trump’s disastrous tariffs that harmed Pennsylvania small businesses and ensured Pennsylvanians will pay more for groceries.

### Mastriano stood by while trump attacked social security and fired hard-working Pennsylvanians

-   In 2025, Mastriano [praised](https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/garrity-and-meuser-bring-potential-gubernatorial-pitches-to-conservative-conference/) Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” as DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) [ability](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/) to [deliver services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. Nearly [3 million Pennsylvanians](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/pa.pdf) relied on Social Security benefits. 
-   Mastriano promoted DOGE, even [sponsoring](https://www.cityandstatepa.com/policy/2025/03/doug-mastriano-calls-congress-support-doge-he-backs-state-level-doge-bill/403696/) legislation to create a Pennsylvania DOGE, despite it resulting in [federal funding cuts](https://www.cityandstatepa.com/politics/2025/02/4-ways-federal-government-actions-are-impacting-pennsylvania/403041/) to Pennsylvania agencies and universities, and [impacting](https://www.axios.com/local/pittsburgh/2025/04/02/doge-food-bank-pennsylvania-farmers) food banks and farmers. Mastriano supported DOGE cuts as Trump threatened the livelihoods of approximately [75,000 federal workers](https://penncapital-star.com/economy/trumps-cuts-to-federal-workers-have-taken-their-toll-on-pa-more-are-coming/#:~:text=The%20federal%20workforce%20there%20is%20largely%20employed,cuts%20%E2%80%9Cwill%20have%20no%20negative%20effect%20o) in Pennsylvania.

**Message:** While Social Security lines grew and Pennsylvania workers were laid off, Mastriano did nothing to help them.

### Mastriano Threatened Clean Energy Jobs In Pennsylvania

-   Mastriano [opposed](https://www.facebook.com/SenatorDougMastriano/posts/pfbid02ooxkJG3k88ijkCZvmwo9SVTiFnb8ZQ7QWQ4FVhtab8khtGqUPzbV5gLmXymaca1Kl) the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits, calling the law a “misnomer, at best, to distract from the billion in handouts it awards to green energy.” In 2025, Trump and Congressional Republicans [repealed](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-passes-senate-megabill-trump-ira-tax-credit/752276/) clean energy tax credits and made them harder to access, threatening clean energy jobs in Pennsylvania. Since the beginning of the Trump administration, clean energy projects that were projected to create hundreds of jobs in Pennsylvania were cancelled, such as the [Mineral Basin Solar Power](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/02/doe-cancel-grants-hydrogen-hubs-grid-projects-00591697) and Pennsylvania’s biggest [solar array](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/10/02/clean-energy-grants-canceled/) on the site of an old coal mine.
-   Mastriano also [denied](https://www.inquirer.com/news/facebook-pennsylvania-governor-mastriano-abortion-climate-20220718.html) climate change, claiming it was a theory based on “pop science,” and [voted](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/RC/Public/rc_view_action2.cfm?sess_yr=2021&sess_ind=0&rc_body=S&rc_nbr=155) to prevent Pennsylvania from joining the [Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative](https://www.palegis.us/senate/co-sponsorship/memo?memoID=33520&document=SB119). Mastriano also [introduced](https://www.2822news.com/state-news-2/republican-lawmakers-introduce-pa-energy-independence-act/) legislation calling for new energy plants to be exempt from EPA regulations and [voted](https://www.palegis.us/senate/roll-calls/summary?sessYr=2019&sessInd=0&rcNum=208) for legislation that would [ease restrictions on polluters](https://scorecard.conservationpa.org/senate-scorecard-2019-2020.html?district=SD-33).

**Message:** Mastriano was a threat to Pennsylvania’s environment and supported killing clean energy job opportunities and clean energy initiatives. 

### Mastriano Was An Anti-Abortion Extremist

-   Although Doug Mastriano tried to [soften](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/doug-mastriano-shifting-tone-on-abortion-20220728.html) his tone on abortion during his 2022 gubernatorial run, Mastriano was an anti-abortion extremist.
-   Mastriano said he wanted [“abortion to end, period,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXm7uibpLY8) and [sponsored](https://www.penncapital-star.com/health-care/abortion-rights-are-always-on-the-ballot-advocates-issue-a-call-to-action-ahead-of-2022-election/) legislation to ban abortion at six weeks without any [exceptions](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pa-republican-governor-debate-takeaways-20220427.html). Mastriano admitted his abortion ban would charge women with [murder](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/27/us/politics/doug-mastriano-abortion-murder.html) if they got abortions later in pregnancy. He also [voted](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/RC/Public/rc_view_action2.cfm?sess_yr=2021&sess_ind=0&rc_body=S&rc_nbr=709) to create a constitutional amendment that denied Pennsylvanians of the right to an abortion, and [scrutinized](https://senatormastriano.com/2022/07/30/mastriano-wolfs-publicity-stunt-lawsuit-threatens-to-silence-voters/) Governor Wolf’s legal challenges to the amendment. 
-   Mastriano [celebrated](https://www.facebook.com/Fight4pa/posts/pfbid02oVPuna6xTc8jRwtmF3CXatjWr9dj3MysVYcoLq1ZqcZcv6ehwhyakZXxaCPCyQX6l) the overturning of Roe v. Wade, and [called](https://senatormastriano.com/2022/05/03/mastriano-provides-statement-on-the-impending-overturn-of-roe-v-wade/) the day Roe v. Wade was first decided “one of the darkest days in American history.” He [claimed](https://web.archive.org/web/20220622203000/https:/www.politicspa.com/as-roe-v-wade-hangs-in-balance-where-do-candidates-stand/108645/) that life began at conception, and called abortion a [“barbaric Holocaust.”](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/doug-mastriano-governor-christian-nationalism-qanon-20220504.html) Mastriano [dismissed](https://web.archive.org/web/20220622203000/https:/www.politicspa.com/as-roe-v-wade-hangs-in-balance-where-do-candidates-stand/108645/) bodily autonomy, claiming that “my body my choice is ridiculous nonsense.”

**Message:** Mastriano threatened the reproductive freedoms of Pennsylvanians.

### Mastriano Threatened The Voting Rights Of Pennsylvanians

-   Mastriano, who made baseless claims about [election fraud](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/decision-2022/pa-senate-republicans-revive-election-bill-over-2020-gripes/3262895/), supported measures that threatened the voting rights of Pennsylvanians. 
-   Although he [voted](https://www.palegis.us/senate/roll-calls/summary?sessYr=2019&sessInd=0&rcNum=311) for Act 77 in 2019, which expanded mail-in voting in Pennsylvania, Mastriano supported legislation to [repeal](https://senatormastriano.com/2022/08/03/mastriano-election-reform-vital-after-supreme-courts-partisan-act-77-ruling/) no-excuse mail-in voting. 
-   Despite it violating federal law, Mastriano said he wanted every Pennsylvanian to [re-register](https://www.wesa.fm/politics-government/2022-06-05/explainer-can-pennsylvania-gop-candidate-doug-mastriano-make-voters-re-register) to vote.
-   Mastriano [introduced](https://twitter.com/SenMastriano/status/1493196945338384391) legislation to purge Pennsylvania’s voter rolls, and voted for a [constitutional amendment](https://www.palegis.us/senate/roll-calls/summary?sessYr=2021&sessInd=0&rcNum=207) to mandate voter I.D. in Pennsylvania. 
-   Mastriano [co-sponsored](https://web.archive.org/web/20220415195233/https:/www.pasenategop.com/blog/mastriano-votes-to-ban-zuck-bucks-and-ballot-drop-boxes/) and voted for legislation to [ban the use of ballot drop boxes](https://www.palegis.us/senate/roll-calls/summary?sessYr=2021&sessInd=0&rcNum=499) and co-sponsored and voted for legislation to [ban private funds for elections administration](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?sYear=2021&sInd=0&body=S&type=B&bn=982).
-   Mastriano sponsored and voted for the [Poll Watcher Empowerment Act](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/BillInfo.cfm?syear=2021&sind=0&body=S&type=B&bn=573), claiming reforms to partisan election observers would [“restore trust and integrity in elections.”](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/decision-2022/pa-senate-republicans-revive-election-bill-over-2020-gripes/3262895/)

**Message:** Mastriano’s threats to voting rights would disenfranchise many Pennsylvanians. 

### Mastriano Was An Insurrectionist And Threat To Democracy

-   Mastriano was an election denier who tried to [overturn](https://whyy.org/articles/pa-sen-doug-mastriano-subpoenaed-by-jan-6-committee/) Pennsylvania’s 2020 election results and was [Trump’s “point person”](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/us/politics/trump-fake-electors-emails.html) in Pennsylvania to help organize fake electors in the commonwealth. The [FBI questioned Mastriano](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/politics/doug-mastriano-january-6-committee) over his involvement at the insurrection, and the [January 6^th^ committee subpoenaed Mastriano](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/doug-mastriano-subpoena-jan-6-capitol-attack-20220215.html) for sending fake elections, trying to overturn the election, and participating in the insurrection. Mastriano repeatedly lied about his involvement and connections to the January 6^th^ attack on the Capitol.
-   Mastriano [claimed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/on-religion/a-pennsylvania-lawmaker-and-the-resurgence-of-christian-nationalism) he left the riot when it no longer became peaceful but stayed long enough to see rioters breach the Capitol building.
-   Mastriano [claimed](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/doug-mastriano-capitol-riot_n_60ac5e99e4b019ef10de09c7?sm7) he did not “go beyond police lines” but was [recorded](https://twitter.com/K2theSky/status/1395981339007111169) crossing police lines as rioters threw police barricades to the side.
-   Mastriano [claimed](https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/sen-mastriano-and-former-state-rep-saccone-among-trump-supporters-who-occupied-us-capitol/Content?oid=18690728) he did not condone the violence at the Capitol building but [spent](https://whyy.org/articles/mastriano-campaign-spent-thousands-on-buses-ahead-of-d-c-insurrection/) more than $3,000 in campaign funds to pay for rioters to travel to the Capitol, one of whom was later [arrested](https://www.newyorker.com/news/on-religion/a-pennsylvania-lawmaker-and-the-resurgence-of-christian-nationalism) for carrying a weapon.
-   Mastriano [denied](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/samuel-lazar-trump-mastriano-capitol-attack_n_60a31164e4b03e1dd38d718e) knowing [Sam Lazar](https://lancasteronline.com/news/local/lancaster-county-man-on-fbi-most-wanted-list-in-capitol-attack-footage-shows/article_b10587f4-998c-11eb-b115-e3e95ef1f1dd.html), an Ephrata man who was arrested for assaulting police officers at the Capitol with [pepper spray](https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-pennsylvania-capitol-siege-e01971a8f2fae24a667b28e8e8a50968), but Mastriano had been [photographed](https://www.inquirer.com/news/samuel-lazar-capitol-riot-doug-mastriano-face-paint-blowhard-20210727.html) several times with Lazar.

**Message:** Mastriano was a danger to democracy and repeatedly lied about his involvement in the January 6 insurrection. 

### Mastriano Made Anti-Semitic Remarks And Was At Odds With Pennsylvania’s Jewish Community

-   After his failed 2022 gubernatorial bid, Mastriano [compared](https://forward.com/fast-forward/546826/doug-mastriano-pa-gubernatorial-bid-jews-holocaust/) the churches that did not publicly endorse him to enablers of the Holocaust. During his 2022 run for Pennsylvania governor, Mastriano faced several scandals that put him at odds with the Jewish community.
-   Mastriano’s consultant and GAB CEO, Andrew Torba, [said](https://www.mediamatters.org/gab/doug-mastriano-consultant-and-gab-ceo-andrew-torba-jewish-conservatives-ben-shapiro-arent) he did not want Jews or atheists in his movement, and Mastriano [pushed back](https://forward.com/fast-forward/512986/doug-mastriano-fights-back-against-antisemitism-accusations-citing-shofar/) against [criticism](https://www.jta.org/2022/07/22/politics/republican-jews-call-on-doug-mastriano-gop-candidate-for-pa-governor-to-stop-using-gab) for his ties to the social media platform GAB. 
-   Mastriano’s campaign [paid](https://www.wesa.fm/courts-justice/2022-07-13/gop-candidate-for-pa-governor-mastriano-paid-5-000-to-the-website-used-by-the-tree-of-life-shooter) $5,000 to GAB, the same website that the Tree of Life shooter frequently used, for “consulting services.” A few days after the payment, the Founder and CEO of GAB, Andrew Torba, endorsed Mastriano’s campaign. 
-   Mastriano downplayed criticisms after he called Josh Shapiro’s children’s Jewish day school [“privileged, exclusive, and elite.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/10/us/politics/mastriano-shapiro-antisemitism.html)
-   At a campaign event, Mastriano said [“we are starting to look like East Germany.”](https://www.mcall.com/news/local/mc-nws-mastriano-campaign-allentown-20221008-kvzqzb3uwvbvlgk4b4by3lgsoy-story.html) 
-   At another campaign event, Mastriano supporters were instructed to [salute](https://www.jta.org/2022/09/19/politics/right-hand-salutes-at-trump-and-mastriano-rallies-earn-comparisons-to-the-nazi-sieg-heil) similar to the “Heil Hitler” salute. 
-   After Mastriano’s campaign event [appropriated Jewish symbols](https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2022/02/an-open-letter-to-sen-mastriano-opinion.html), a group of Jewish organizations in Pennsylvania urged Mastriano to apologize and denounce Christian efforts to appropriate Jewish rituals. 

**Message:** Mastriano disrespected Pennsylvania’s Jewish community. 

### Mastriano Was A Christian Nationalist And Far-Right Extremist

-   Although he denied it, Mastriano embodied the [Christian Nationalist](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/doug-mastriano-governor-christian-nationalism-qanon-20220504.html) movement and called the separation of church and state a [“myth.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/us/christian-nationalism-politicians.html)
-   Mastriano was an [extremist](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/doug-mastriano-senate-lgbtq-islam-climate-dreamers-1397275/) who ran a [memes Facebook group](https://www.thedailybeast.com/pennsylvania-governor-candidate-doug-mastrianos-secret-meme-page-is-a-far-right-rats-nest/?ref=scroll) and posted offensive and [Islamophobic](https://penncapital-star.com/government-politics/conspiratorial-anti-muslim-memes-populate-facebook-page-of-state-senate-candidate/) content. 
-   In 2022, Mastriano also [promoted](https://www.mediamatters.org/qanon-conspiracy-theory/pa-state-sen-doug-mastriano-promoted-qanon-twitter-over-50-times) QAnon conspiracies on his social media, [attended](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/doug-mastriano-teddy-daniels-qanon-conference-gop-candidates-20220427.html) a far-right conference promoting QAnon, and [touted](https://www.inquirer.com/news/mastriano-shapiro-antisemitism-rabbi-kolakowski-20220901.html) the endorsement of Rabbi Joseph Kolakowski, who spoke favorably of the QAnon movement and claimed Hitler was part lizard.
-   In 2017, Mastriano posed in a [Confederate uniform](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-pennsylvania-candidate-mastriano-posed-confederate-uniform-army-war-2022-08-26/) for a faculty photo at the Army War College. In 2022, Mastriano thanked [pro-Confederate](https://www.mediamatters.org/diversity-discrimination/facebook-video-doug-mastriano-thanked-pro-confederate-armed-men-supposedly) armed men for supposedly defending a General Lee statue.

**Message:** Mastriano is too extreme and far-right for Pennsylvania. 

### Mastriano Earned His Doctorate On “Shaky Grounds”

-   In 2024, Mastriano [sued](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/09/doug-mastriano-lawsuit/) the University of Brunswick due to the criticism his academic research received. In 2022, University of Brunswick Professor Jeffrey Brown, Mastriano’s doctoral program advisor, said Mastriano earned his PhD on [“shaky grounds.”](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mastriano-new-brunswick-york-1.6605669) Brown argued Mastriano’s doctoral research was “atrocious,” “dishonest,” and “sloppy,” and described Mastriano as a [“dangerous religious zealot.”](https://www.inquirer.com/news/doug-mastriano-war-college-biddle-coplen-alvin-york-20221016.html) Following Brown’s allegations, the University of Brunswick said they would [review](https://www.inquirer.com/news/doug-mastriano-war-college-biddle-coplen-alvin-york-20221016.html) internal processes for awarding doctorates. Additionally, historians [scrutinized](https://apnews.com/article/doug-mastriano-research-alvin-york-backlash-96db4958d0caeb992347d9b83198084f) Mastriano’s book about World War I Sgt. Alvin York for being incorrect.
-   In 2002, Mastriano wrote an [academic paper](https://www.penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/mastriano-penned-2002-paper-justifying-civilian-casualties-raises-eyebrows-among-war-scholars/) that called the U.S. military’s “hypersensitivity to civilian deaths” an “enormous weakness.” He further added that U.S. war strategies were predictable and claimed Saddam Husein took advantage of their “reluctance to bomb civilian targets.” 
-   In 2001, Mastriano published his [thesis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/20/mastriano-thesis-hitlerian-putsch-pennsylvania/) which warned that the U.S. would be vulnerable to a left-wing “Hitlerian Putsch” that would dismantle the military and further destroy democracy. He further described how the future collapse of the U.S. military would lead to the rise of a left-wing leader obsessed with “political correctness” in a struggle that would ultimately kill millions of Americans.

**Message:** Mastriano lacked integrity in academia and lacks integrity to fight for Pennsylvanians.
