# How To win against Stacy Garrity

Stacy Garrity would not fight for Pennsylvanians. Garrity supported federal legislation that stripped health care from thousands of Pennsylvanians, set up future cuts to Medicare, cut SNAP benefits, and rescinded tax credits meant to support clean energy jobs and projects in Pennsylvania. She supported Trump’s disastrous tariffs that harmed small businesses and increased prices for Pennsylvanians. Garrity praised Trump’s DOGE while Social Security lines grew, funding cuts threatened universities, farmers, and food banks, and Pennsylvania workers were laid off. Garrity posed a threat to Pennsylvanians’ reproductive freedoms with her anti-abortion extremism. Garrity denied the 2020 election results, opposed Pennsylvania’s mail-in voting system, and would allow Trump to overreach his authority and send the National Guard against Pennsylvanians. Stacy Garrity would leave Pennsylvania vulnerable to Trump’s attacks.

### **GARRITY SUPPORTED DEVASTATING HEALTH CARE CUTS** 
-	In 2025, Garrity [supported](https://x.com/GarrityForPA/status/1940757598761816555) a bill that is estimated to kick [17 million](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) Americans off their health insurance, including nearly [12 million]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) Americans who rely on Medicaid. While Garrity [praised](https://x.com/GarrityForPA/status/1924879935728189650) the bill as a “historic plan,” more than [451,000 Pennsylvanians](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) could lose their health insurance as a result of the bill. More than [496,000 Pennsylvanians]( https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/marketplace-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=0&selectedRows=%7B%22states%22:%7B%22pennsylvania%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) were enrolled in Affordable Care Act Marketplace health insurance plans. 
-	Garrity [suggested](https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2025/06/washington-leads-while-harrisburg-lags-on-reform-pennlive-letters.html?outputType=amp) Pennsylvania’s government should replicate the Medicaid restrictions imposed under Trump’s tax bill, even though [Medicaid expansion](https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/medicaid-expansion-frequently-asked-questions-0) enabled coverage for more Pennsylvanians. More than [300,000 Medicaid recipients]( https://www.spotlightpa.org/statecollege/2025/06/medicaid-pennsylvania-trump-republican-budget-rural-health-care/) in Pennsylvania were expected to lose their coverage due to Trump’s tax bill. 

**Message:** Garrity supported ripping away health care from thousands of Pennsylvanians to fund tax cuts for the wealthy. 

### **GARRITY SUPPORTED MASSIVE CUTS TO MEDICARE**

-   In 2025, Garrity [supported]( https://x.com/GarrityForPA/status/1940757598761816555) a bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would trigger [nearly $500 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare absent future congressional action.

**Message:** Garrity supported making massive cuts to health care services seniors rely on. 

### **GARRITY SUPPORTED TRUMP’S DEVASTATING TARIFFS**

-	In 2025, Garrity [supported](https://x.com/GarrityForPA/status/1886483884658831501) Trump’s tariffs, which were dooming Pennsylvanians to a trade war and [rising prices.](https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/garrity-and-meuser-bring-potential-gubernatorial-pitches-to-conservative-conference/) 
-	Garrity even [recognized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv05AZy8eSU) that Trump’s tariffs would increase prices. Tariffs are contributing to [higher food prices]( https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi) and are [hurting]( https://www.fox43.com/article/news/local/small-businesses-worry-about-tariffs-impacting-the-holiday-shopping-season-holidays-lancaster-county/521-0afe4a32-8fe3-48e0-b220-20a4ca14608c) Pennsylvania small businesses and families. From January to May 2025, Pennsylvanians faced an estimated cost of [$1.6 billion]( https://www.axios.com/local/pittsburgh/2025/07/16/1-6-billion-tariff-impacts-on-pennsylvania) in tariffs. Despite this, Garrity called Trump’s tariffs ["common sense measures,"]( https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/garrity-and-meuser-bring-potential-gubernatorial-pitches-to-conservative-conference/) even as the [U.S. stock market crashed]( https://www.npr.org/2025/04/04/nx-s1-5352362/markets-selloff-dow-trump-tariffs) due to Trump’s escalating global trade war.


**Message:** Garrity supported Trump’s disastrous tariffs that harmed Pennsylvania small businesses and ensured Pennsylvanians will pay more for groceries.

### **GARRITY SUPPORTED STRIPPING SNAP BENEFITS FROM PENNSYLVANIA FAMILIES**

-	In 2025, Garrity [supported]( https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2025/11/pennsylvania-gop-trump-garrity-2026-governor-election-elections/) a bill that made the [largest cut to SNAP in history.]( https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-senate-republican-leaderships-reconciliation-bill-takes) Garrity [praised]( https://x.com/GarrityForPA/status/1924879935728189650) the legislation as a “historic plan,” claiming the bill would cut [“wasteful spending.”]( https://x.com/GarrityForPA/status/1924879933119332598) In Pennsylvania, more than [795,000 people]( https://www.fns.usda.gov/data-research/data-visualization/snap-community-characteristics-congressional-district-dashboard) relied on SNAP to afford groceries.

**Message:** Garrity supported making food more expensive for Pennsylvanians.

### **GARRITY STOOD BY WHILE TRUMP ATTACKED SOCIAL SECURITY AND FIRED HARD-WORKING PENNSYLVANIANS**

-	In 2025, Garrity [praised]( https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/garrity-and-meuser-bring-potential-gubernatorial-pitches-to-conservative-conference/) Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” as DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) [ability](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/) to [deliver services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. Nearly [3 million Pennsylvanians]( https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/pa.pdf) relied on Social Security benefits. 
-	Garrity promoted DOGE even though it resulted in [federal funding cuts]( https://www.cityandstatepa.com/politics/2025/02/4-ways-federal-government-actions-are-impacting-pennsylvania/403041/) to Pennsylvania agencies and universities, and [impacted]( https://www.axios.com/local/pittsburgh/2025/04/02/doge-food-bank-pennsylvania-farmers) food banks and farmers. Garrity supported DOGE cuts as Trump threatened the livelihoods of approximately [75,000 federal workers]( https://penncapital-star.com/economy/trumps-cuts-to-federal-workers-have-taken-their-toll-on-pa-more-are-coming/#:~:text=The%20federal%20workforce%20there%20is%20largely%20employed,cuts%20%E2%80%9Cwill%20have%20no%20negative%20effect%20o) in Pennsylvania.

**Message:** While Social Security lines grew and Pennsylvania workers were laid off, Garrity did nothing to help them.

### **GARRITY THREATENED CLEAN ENERGY JOBS IN PENNSYLVANIA**

-	In 2025, Garrity [supported](https://x.com/GarrityForPA/status/1940757598761816555) the bill that [repealed](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-passes-senate-megabill-trump-ira-tax-credit/752276/) clean energy tax credits and made them harder to access, threatening clean energy jobs in Pennsylvania. Since the beginning of the Trump administration, clean energy projects that were projected to create hundreds of jobs in Pennsylvania were cancelled, such as the [Mineral Basin Solar Power]( https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/02/doe-cancel-grants-hydrogen-hubs-grid-projects-00591697) and Pennsylvania’s biggest [solar array]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/10/02/clean-energy-grants-canceled/) on the site of an old coal mine.
-	In 2022, Garrity [supported](https://patreasury.gov/newsroom/archive/2022/05-18-RGGI.html) a lawsuit to prevent Pennsylvania from joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).

**Message:** Garrity supported killing job opportunities for Pennsylvanians to give tax cuts to billionaires. 


### **GARRITY WAS AN ANTI-ABORTION EXTREMIST**

-	Although she [tried]( https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/11/establishment-gop-pick-in-pa-gov-race-looks-to-pivot-from-her-anti-abortion-past-00556345) to soften her tone on abortion, Garrity was an out-of-touch anti-abortion extremist.
-	Garrity [celebrated]( https://americanjournalnews.com/anti-abortion-extremists-eye-pennsylvania-governors-mansion/) the overturning of Roe v. Wade and [claimed]( https://www.facebook.com/GarrityForPA/posts/pfbid0zPr7Lx4qtG4hbpj4UUenroEHoxgP88g8PRU7keXXJSdNjjdStv1htL8Ym7LBhyFwl) it “was wrong from the beginning.” Garrity supported [defunding]( https://americanjournalnews.com/anti-abortion-extremists-eye-pennsylvania-governors-mansion/) Planned Parenthood and previously [sold]( https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/11/establishment-gop-pick-in-pa-gov-race-looks-to-pivot-from-her-anti-abortion-past-00556345) anti-abortion campaign merchandise. While Garrity [claimed]( https://www.fox43.com/article/news/politics/elections/stacy-garrity-fox43-pennsylvania-josh-shapiro-2026-governor-republican-nomine-election/521-624f6be3-3ae8-426e-8415-476b7a30aaaf) she no longer wanted to talk abortion, she previously [said,]( https://americanjournalnews.com/2024-election-abortion-reproductive-rights-pennsylvania-senate-republicans/) “What’s really dangerous to families and freedom is aborting babies and packing the Supreme Court.”

**Message:** Garrity threatened the reproductive freedoms of Pennsylvanians.

### **GARRITY WAS A THREAT TO THE VOTING RIGHTS OF PENNSYLVANIANS**

- Garrity was an election denier who [opposed]( https://www.fox43.com/article/news/politics/elections/stacy-garrity-fox43-pennsylvania-josh-shapiro-2026-governor-republican-nomine-election/521-624f6be3-3ae8-426e-8415-476b7a30aaaf) mail-in ballots, except for when Republicans used them. Although Garrity [tried]( https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/garrity-campaign-tries-to-walk-back-election-denial/) to walk back her election denialism, Garrity [claimed]( https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2022/05/06/donald-trump-mehmet-oz-u-s-senate-save-america-guy-reschenthaler-j-d-vance-westmoreland/stories/202205060143) Trump won the 2020 election and [spoke]( https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/garrity-campaign-tries-to-walk-back-election-denial/) at a rally one day before the January 6 insurrection to cast doubt on the 2020 election results. 
- While Garrity [claimed]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXFx0FEmtpQ) she did not like mail-in ballots and said Trump had a “legitimate concern” over voter fraud, she also [touted]( https://twitter.com/GarrityForPA/status/1658608518683844619) Republicans “stepping up” in embracing mail-in voting.

**Message:** Garrity was an election denier and posed a threat to the voting rights of Pennsylvanians. 

### **GARRITY WOULD NOT PROTECT PENNSYLVANIANS FROM TRUMP’S OVERREACH**

- As Trump overreached his authority and [deployed]( https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/pennsylvania-joins-multi-state-lawsuit-over-trump-deploying-national-guard-in-cities/) National Guard troops without the consent of governors across several American cities, Garrity [said]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bfOEcDjAt4) she would be open to Trump sending National Guard troops to Philadelphia.

**Message:** Garrity would allow Trump to overreach his authority and send the National Guard against Pennsylvanians.
