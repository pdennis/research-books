<h1>Doug Mastriano - Key votes</h1>
<h2>Mastriano Voted To Prevent Pennsylvania From Joining The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative And Ease Restrictions On Polluters</h2>
<h3>Mastriano Voted To Prevent Pennsylvania From Joining The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)</h3>
<p><strong>2021: Mastriano Voted For SB 119, Which Would Prevent Pennsylvania From Joining The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).&nbsp;</strong>According to the Pennsylvania General Assembly, “An Act authorizing the Department of Environmental Protection to conduct a public comment process on and submit to the General Assembly a measure or action intended to abate, control or limit carbon dioxide emissions by imposing a revenue-generating tax or fee on carbon dioxide emissions.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong>[Pennsylvania General Assembly, SB 119, <a href="https://www.palegis.us/legislation/bills/2021/sb119">3/30/22</a>, Votes, <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/RC/Public/rc_view_action2.cfm?sess_yr=2021&amp;sess_ind=0&amp;rc_body=S&amp;rc_nbr=155">6/14/21</a>]</p>

  <li><strong>SB 119 Sponsors Claimed The Bill Would Mandate Legislative Approval Before Pennsylvania Adopts A Carbon Tax In An Effort To Prevent Pennsylvania From Joining The</strong> <strong>Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) Without General Assembly Approval.&nbsp;</strong>According to the SB 119 Co-Sponsorship Memo Details via the Pennsylvania General Assembly, “A carbon tax is a major energy and fiscal policy initiative, and if such a tax is to be imposed on Pennsylvania employers, we believe it should be approved by the General Assembly. Beyond the fiscal impact on Pennsylvania manufacturers, coal and gas electric generation, consumers, and future economic investments made in our state, it also creates serious constitutional questions of checks and balances between co-equal branches of government. To support the authority of the General Assembly on this issue, we will re-introduce Senate Bill 950 from last session to delineate the process for legislative approval before Pennsylvania imposes a carbon tax on employers engaged in electric generation, manufacturing or other industries operating in the Commonwealth, or enter into any multi-state program, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), that would impose such a tax.” [Pennsylvania General Assembly, SB 119 Co-Sponsorship Memo Details, <a href="https://www.palegis.us/senate/co-sponsorship/memo?memoID=33520&amp;document=SB119">12/15/20</a>]</li>
