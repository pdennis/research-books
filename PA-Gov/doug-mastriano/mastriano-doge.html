<p><strong>2025: Mastriano Called On Pennsylvania’s Congressional Delegation To Support Trump’s DOGE And Cut Federal Spending, Claiming “Billions Of Dollars Have Vanished Into Fraudulent Programs And Unnecessary Contracts.”</strong> According to City &amp; State Pennsylvania, “GOP state Sen. Doug Mastriano is calling on Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation to support the Department of Government Efficiency’s sweeping effort to reform the federal government. &nbsp;&nbsp;In a statement released Wednesday, Mastriano urged legislators at the federal level to coalesce behind DOGE, the effort to remake the federal government and cut spending that has been spearheaded by President Donald Trump and his advisor and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘For too long, taxpayer dollars have been wasted on bloated bureaucracies, redundant programs and outrageous foreign expenditures that do nothing for the hardworking people of Pennsylvania,’ Mastriano said in a Wednesday press release. ‘Government inefficiency is a hidden tax on every citizen. Billions of dollars have vanished into fraudulent programs and unnecessary contracts. Critical resources have been misallocated while Pennsylvanians struggle to make ends meet.’” [City &amp; State Pennsylvania, <a href="https://www.cityandstatepa.com/policy/2025/03/doug-mastriano-calls-congress-support-doge-he-backs-state-level-doge-bill/403696/">3/12/25</a>]</p>

<p><strong>The Center On Budget And Policy Priorities Said The Trump Administration Had Pushed Out 7,000 Social Security Workers.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, "Over the past five months, the Trump Administration has forced the Social Security Administration (SSA) through a radical transformation that threatens to disrupt services for the largely older and severely disabled people who most rely on the agency.[1] The Trump Administration and its so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have created huge gaps in customer service and support by indiscriminately pushing out 7,000 workers to hit an arbitrary staffing reduction target. This is the largest staffing cut in SSA’s history.[2] (See Figure 1.)"

Not only has he sponsored a resolution calling for Congress to support the federal government initiative, but he has also introduced legislation that would create a Pennsylvania Department of Government Efficiency. According to a co-sponsorship memo circulated by Mastriano, the Pennsylvania DOGE would report to the General Assembly, and would have the power to audit state agencies, immediately suspend payments from state agencies or departments and recommend that ‘wasteful’ agencies or departments be dissolved. &nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, Mastriano said DOGE can serve as a model for the public sector. ‘Following this model, the public sector can eliminate waste, streamline operations, adopt data-driven decision making and use technology to reduce costs and improve services,’ he said in his statement. ‘Government cannot be bogged down by outdated bureaucracy and broken systems any longer. Let’s stand together, demand results and push for a government that works for us.’” [City &amp; State Pennsylvania, <a href="https://www.cityandstatepa.com/policy/2025/03/doug-mastriano-calls-congress-support-doge-he-backs-state-level-doge-bill/403696/">3/12/25</a>]&nbsp;</p>

Mostly, they were probationary workers — meaning they were in their first year or so of employment, and didn’t have the job protections of their more senior colleagues. &nbsp;&nbsp;Before the layoffs, the commonwealth was home to around 75,000 federal workers, not including post office workers or military members, according to data provided by the state Department of Labor and Industry.” [Pennsylvania Capital-Star, <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/economy/trumps-cuts-to-federal-workers-have-taken-their-toll-on-pa-more-are-coming/#:~:text=The%20federal%20workforce%20there%20is%20largely%20employed,cuts%20%E2%80%9Cwill%20have%20no%20negative%20effect%20o">3/17/25</a>]</p>
