<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In 2024, Mastriano <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/09/doug-mastriano-lawsuit/">sued</a> the University of Brunswick due to the criticism his academic research received. In 2022, University of Brunswick Professor Jeffrey Brown, Mastriano’s doctoral program advisor, said Mastriano earned his PhD on <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mastriano-new-brunswick-york-1.6605669">“shaky grounds.”</a> Brown argued Mastriano’s doctoral research was “atrocious,” “dishonest,” and “sloppy,” and described Mastriano as a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/doug-mastriano-war-college-biddle-coplen-alvin-york-20221016.html">“dangerous religious zealot.”</a> Following Brown’s allegations, the University of Brunswick said they would <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/doug-mastriano-war-college-biddle-coplen-alvin-york-20221016.html">review</a> internal processes for awarding doctorates. Additionally, historians <a href="https://apnews.com/article/doug-mastriano-research-alvin-york-backlash-96db4958d0caeb992347d9b83198084f">scrutinized</a> Mastriano’s book about World War I Sgt. Alvin York for being incorrect.</p>
<p>In 2002, Mastriano wrote an <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/mastriano-penned-2002-paper-justifying-civilian-casualties-raises-eyebrows-among-war-scholars/">academic paper</a> that called the U.S. military’s “hypersensitivity to civilian deaths” an “enormous weakness.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong>He further added that U.S. war strategies were predictable and claimed Saddam Husein took advantage of their “reluctance to bomb civilian targets.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2001, Mastriano published his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/20/mastriano-thesis-hitlerian-putsch-pennsylvania/">thesis</a> which warned that the U.S. would be vulnerable to a left-wing “Hitlerian Putsch” that would dismantle the military and further destroy democracy. He further described how the future collapse of the U.S. military would lead to the rise of a left-wing leader obsessed with “political correctness” in a struggle that would ultimately kill millions of Americans.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mastriano’s Doctoral Program Advisor Scrutinized Mastriano’s Doctoral Research As “Atrocious” And “Dishonest,” Prompting The University Of New Brunswick To Re-Evaluate Their Processes For Awarding Doctorates</h2>

<p><strong>2024: Mastriano Filed A “Defamation, Racketeering, And Antitrust Lawsuit” Against The University Of New Brunswick For The Criticism Of His World War I Research.&nbsp;</strong>According to Spotlight PA, “A Pennsylvania state senator and former GOP gubernatorial candidate whose support for Donald Trump drew him to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 has sued a Canadian university and nearly two dozen academics over criticism of him and his research into World War I hero Sgt. Alvin York.&nbsp;&nbsp;State Sen. Doug Mastriano's defamation, racketeering, and antitrust lawsuit, filed in western Oklahoma federal court, seeks at least $10 million in damages from defendants including history professors and the University of New Brunswick.” [Spotlight PA, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/09/doug-mastriano-lawsuit/">9/20/24</a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Mastriano’s Research Of York Earned Him A Doctorate In History From The University Of New Brunswick And A Publishing Deal With The University Press Of Kentucky.</strong> According to the Associated Press, “Mastriano had a deep interest in York long before he led anti-mask protests last year, fought tirelessly to overturn then-President Donald Trump’s&nbsp;reelection loss&nbsp;and showed up outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot. Mastriano’s research into York helped earn him a doctorate in history from the University of New Brunswick and a publishing deal with the University Press of Kentucky, but critics argue his work does not hold up to scrutiny.” [Associated Press,&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/doug-mastriano-research-alvin-york-backlash-96db4958d0caeb992347d9b83198084f">3/20/21</a>]</li>

That caption makes no claim about which Germans are shown or if York is in the photo, saying an Army photographer ‘took the photo but at the time they were not identified as York’s prisoners.’” [Associated Press,&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/doug-mastriano-research-alvin-york-backlash-96db4958d0caeb992347d9b83198084f">3/20/21</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>2011: Mastriano Said The Photo Had Been Mislabeled And That “We Are Fairly Sure This Is Of York.”</strong> According to the Associate Press, “Four years later, in a 2011 lecture at the Army Heritage and Education Center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, he was more definitive, saying the photo had been mislabeled. ‘We are fairly sure this is of York. I know that’s hard to see, but you can see the mustache that represents York, it looks like York,’ he said.” [Associated Press,&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/doug-mastriano-research-alvin-york-backlash-96db4958d0caeb992347d9b83198084f">3/20/21</a>]</li>

<h2>Mastriano Wrote Controversial Academic Papers On The Military’s “Hypersensitivity To Civilian Deaths” And Vulnerability To A Left-Wing “Hitlerian Putsch”</h2>

<p><strong>2002: Mastriano Wrote An Academic Paper That Described The U.S. Military’s “Hypersensitivity To Civilian Deaths” An “Enormous Weakness.”</strong> According to Penn Capital-Star, “A leading candidate in Pennsylvania’s Republican primary race for governor wrote in a 2002 academic paper that the U.S. should ‘not hesitate’ to strike at locals if a military regime is nearby, describing the U.S. military’s ‘hypersensitivity’ to civilian deaths as an ‘enormous weakness.’ The remarks appeared in a&nbsp;2002 academic paper&nbsp;written by state Sen. Doug Mastriano, R-Franklin, who is currently seeking the state’s Republican nomination for governor.” [Penn Capital-Star, <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/mastriano-penned-2002-paper-justifying-civilian-casualties-raises-eyebrows-among-war-scholars/">5/5/22</a>]</p>

<h3>Mastriano’s Thesis Warned That The Country Would Be Vulnerable To A Left-Wing “Hitlerian Putsch”</h3>
<p><strong>2001: Mastriano Published A Thesis That Warned That The United States Would Be Vulnerable To A Left-Wing “Hitlerian Putsch” That Would Dismantle The Military And Destroy Democracy.</strong> According to the Washington Post, “Two decades before he was Republican nominee for Pennsylvania governor,&nbsp;Doug Mastriano&nbsp;warned in a master’s thesis that the United States was vulnerable to a left-wing ‘Hitlerian Putsch’ that would begin with the dismantling of the U.S. military and end with the destruction of the country’s democracy. The&nbsp;thesis, written in 2001 when Mastriano was a major at the Air Force’s Air Command and Staff College, is highly unusual for its doom saying and often fearful point of view, and its prediction that only the U.S. military could save the country from the depredations of the country’s morally debauched civilian leaders. The paper is posted on an official Defense Department website and lists Mastriano as the author at a time when he said he received a master’s degree from the school.” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/20/mastriano-thesis-hitlerian-putsch-pennsylvania/">5/20/22</a>]</p>

The military’s collapse, in his telling, allowed a left-wing leader obsessed with ‘political correctness’ and backed militarily by the United Nations and the European Union to rise to power in a struggle that led to the deaths of millions of Americans.” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/20/mastriano-thesis-hitlerian-putsch-pennsylvania/">5/20/22</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>In The Paper, Mastriano Concluded That The US Military Was The Only Institution To Prevent The Destruction Of The Republic.</strong> According to the Washington Post, “Ultimately, Mastriano concluded that the U.S. military was the ‘only institution to prevent the destruction of the republic.’” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/20/mastriano-thesis-hitlerian-putsch-pennsylvania/">5/20/22</a>]</li>
