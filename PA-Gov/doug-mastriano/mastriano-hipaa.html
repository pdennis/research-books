<h3>March 2020: Mastriano Proposed Rolling Back Medical Privacy Protections For COVID-19 Patients And requested A Suspension To HIPAA</h3>
<h4>Mastriano Proposed Rolling Back Medical Privacy Protections For COVID-19 Patients</h4>
<p><strong>Penn Capital-Star: “For A Brief Moment In March 2020, Before His Transition To A Lockdown Opponent And COVID Skeptic Was Complete, Mastriano Seemed To Take The Issue Deadly Seriously.”&nbsp;</strong>According to Penn Capital-Star, “Now, Mastriano is running for governor largely on the brand he built in those early days of the pandemic, telling his supporters to ‘walk as free people,’ downplaying the risk of COVID-19, and vocally opposing vaccine mandates, among other positions. ‘The most important thing after protecting life is restoring your private personal freedom,’ Mastriano said in a stump speech in Harrisburg last month. ‘Under Gov. Mastriano you will live life as you see fit, not as I see fit.’ But, for a brief moment in March 2020, before his transition to a lockdown opponent and COVID skeptic was complete, Mastriano seemed to take the issue deadly seriously.” [Penn Capital-Star, <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/election-2022/now-a-defender-of-personal-freedom-mastriano-wanted-to-lift-privacy-rules-in-pandemics-early-days/">4/1/22</a>]</p>
<p><strong>March 2020: Mastriano Proposed The State And Federal Government Roll Back Medical Privacy Protections For COVID-19 Patients.</strong> According to Penn Capital-Star, “But, for a brief moment in March 2020, before his transition to a lockdown opponent and COVID skeptic was complete, Mastriano seemed to take the issue deadly seriously. In a series of press releases, legislative memos and interviews throughout March 2020, Mastriano proposed the state and the federal government roll back medical privacy protections for COVID-19 patients.” [Penn Capital-Star, <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/election-2022/now-a-defender-of-personal-freedom-mastriano-wanted-to-lift-privacy-rules-in-pandemics-early-days/">4/1/22</a>]</p>
<p><strong>March 2020: Mastriano Proposed A Concurrent Resolution Asking For HIPAA To Be Suspended, Claiming Medical Privacy Regulations Were “Threatening The Lives Of Our Citizens And Depriving Pennsylvania Residents Of Knowing If – And When – They Were Exposed To A Contagious Person.”</strong> According to a press release from Senator Doug Mastriano via Archive.org, “As a result of the COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak, State Senator Doug Mastriano (R-33) is introducing a measure calling upon the federal government to temporarily suspend the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).&nbsp;&nbsp;Mastriano is proposing a concurrent resolution that would suspend the 1996 law and allow for full disclosure of details that are currently considered private, and are not disclosed to the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I am concerned that existing HIPAA regulations are threatening the lives of our citizens and depriving Pennsylvania residents of knowing if – and when – they were exposed to a contagious person,’ said Mastriano. ‘This emergency measure is necessary to share vital and life-saving medical information with those who may have been subjected to this dangerous virus. The new information that would become available would help us combat the spread of the Coronavirus.’” [Press Release – Senator Doug Mastriano via Archive.org, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200319030536/https:/senatormastriano.com/2020/03/17/mastriano-federal-hipaa-regs-should-be-suspended-during-coronavirus-pandemic/">3/17/20</a>]</p>

<h4>Mastriano Scrutinized The Federal Government For “Not Proactively” Rolling Back Medical Privacy Protections And Called HIPAA A “Dangerous Policy”</h4>
<p><strong>March 2020: Mastriano Urged The Federal Government To Suspend HIPAA, Criticized The Federal Government For “Not Proactively” Rolling Back HIPAA, And Called HIPAA A “Dangerous Policy.”</strong> According to a press release from Senator Doug Mastriano via Archive.org, “As part of Mastriano’s proposal, the suspension would remain effective until the COVID-19 crisis passes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Mastriano’s measure calls upon the federal government to take ‘swift and immediate action’ to suspend HIPAA, and urges Congress to enact appropriate legislation for HIPAA-related suspensions addressing future health pandemics.&nbsp;&nbsp;The outbreak has resulted in statewide shutdowns of government agencies, including the regularly-scheduled Senate voting sessions, which were cancelled Monday and Tuesday. &nbsp;‘It is deeply concerning that the federal government did not proactively roll-back this dangerous policy, which endangers our people,’ said Mastriano. ‘This situation changes daily – it remains my top priority to do what is in the best interest of protecting public health, and this measure will increase transparency in an effort to quell the spread of this virus.’” [Press Release – Senator Doug Mastriano via Archive.org, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200319030536/https:/senatormastriano.com/2020/03/17/mastriano-federal-hipaa-regs-should-be-suspended-during-coronavirus-pandemic/">3/17/20</a>]</p>

<h4>Mastriano Wrote A Letter To Trump Asking Him To Suspend The Health Insurance Portability And Accountability Act (HIPAA) And Urged The Elimination Of Confidentiality Protections In Pennsylvania</h4>
<p><strong>March 2020: Mastriano Wrote A Letter To Trump Asking Him To Suspend The Health Insurance Portability And Accountability Act (HIPAA)And Called For A Bill That Would Eliminate State Level Confidentiality Protections.</strong> According to Penn Capital-Star, “The senator followed up the interview with at least two more similar official releases, including a&nbsp;March 19 letter&nbsp;to then-President Donald Trump calling for the suspension of HIPAA, as well as a bill that would&nbsp;eliminate&nbsp;state-level confidentiality protections under Pennsylvania’s 1950’s-era disease control law during a gubernatorial disaster declaration. Mastriano said the latter was needed, citing the Wolf administration’s&nbsp;frequent citation of the law&nbsp;to deny the release of COVID-19 data.” [Penn Capital-Star, <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/election-2022/now-a-defender-of-personal-freedom-mastriano-wanted-to-lift-privacy-rules-in-pandemics-early-days/">4/1/22</a>]</p>
