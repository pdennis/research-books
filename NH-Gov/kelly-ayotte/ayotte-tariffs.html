<h2>Tiffany Was The Deciding Vote To Protect Trump’s Tariffs Despite The Harm They Could Cause To Wisconsin’s Economy</h2>
<h3>Tiffany Repeatedly Voted To Protect Trump’s Tariffs</h3>
<h4>September 2025: Tiffany Voted To Protect Trump’s Tariffs</h4>
<p><strong>September 2025: Tiffany Voted Against Terminating The National Emergency That Allowed Trump To Impose A 40 Percent Tariff On Brazil.</strong> In September 2025, Tom Tiffany voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, a “motion to table the Meeks, D-N.Y., motion to discharge from the House Foreign Affairs Committee the joint resolution that would terminate the national emergency declared by President Donald Trump on July 30, 2025, which imposed an additional 40 percent tariff on certain goods imported from Brazil.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 200 to 198. [House Vote 265, <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll265.xml">9/15/25</a>; Congressional Quarterly, <a href="https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/265?2">9/15/25</a>; Congressional Actions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-joint-resolution/117/all-actions">H.J.Res. 117</a>]</p>
<p><strong>September 2025: Tiffany Effectively Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through March 2026.</strong> In September 2025, Tom Tiffany voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, “the resolution [that] would allow for the tolling (the pausing of counting) of days for resolutions of inquiry from Sept. 30, 2025 through March 31, 2026. It also would provide that each day during the period from April 9, 2025, through March 31, 2026. would not constitute a calendar day for the purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution to terminate President Donald Trump's April 2, 2025 executive order declaring a national emergency regarding tariffs on imported goods. The resolution also would provide that during the period for March 11, 2025 through March 31, 2026, would not constitute a calendar day for purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution terminating a national emergency executive order declared by President Trump on Feb. 1, 2025. Such an executive order concerned tariffs on many Canadian and Mexican imports and Chinese goods. The resolution also would provide that the provisions of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act would not apply through March 31, 2026 to a joint resolution terminating the national emergency.” The vote was on the rule. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 213 to 211.

  <li><strong>Support Was Won From GOP Holdouts Through A Promise Of A Vote Later In The Week To Shorten The Block To End In January Rather Than March.&nbsp;</strong>According to Politico, “GOP leaders flipped several of the Republican holdouts with a promise to add language shortening the block on tariff disapproval votes to a forthcoming measure set for approval later in the week, per two Republicans with direct knowledge of the agreement. The expiration date on the block will be reset from March 31 to the end of January, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Tuesday. It’s likely the Supreme Court will have ruled on a challenge to Trump’s tariff-declaring powers by then.” [Politico,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/16/congress/house-again-votes-to-surrender-tariff-powers-to-trump-00566975">9/16/25</a>]</li>

<h4>April 2025: Tiffany Cast The Deciding Vote To Protect Trump’s Tariffs</h4>
<p><strong>April 2025: Tiffany Cast The Deciding Vote For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs Through September 2025.</strong>&nbsp;In March 2025, according to Congressional Quarterly, Tom Tiffany voted for the “adoption of the rule (H Res 313) that would provide for floor consideration of the Senate amendment to the fiscal 2025 budget resolution (H Con Res 14). The rule would provide up to one hour of debate on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the measure. It also would block the expedited consideration of joint resolutions terminating President Donald Trump’s tariff actions under the April 2 executive order by providing that each day during the period from April 9, 2025 through Sept. 30, 2025, will not constitute a calendar day under the federal law pertaining to terminating national emergencies.” The vote was on the rule. The underlying legislation was the FY 2025 budget resolution. The House agreed to the rule by a vote of 216 to 215. [House Vote 94, <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml">4/9/25</a>; Congressional Quarterly, <a href="https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/94?4">4/9/25</a>; Congressional Actions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/313/all-actions">H.Res. 313</a>; Congressional Actions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/14/all-actions">H.Con.

  <li><strong>Speaker Johnson Backed The Move, Claiming Trump Had “Executive Authority” And That The Tariffs Were “In The Interest Of The American People.”&nbsp;</strong>According to ABC News, “House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., defended the move, telling reporters, ‘I've made it very clear I think the president has executive authority. It's an appropriate level of authority to deal with the unfair trade practices. That's part of the role of the president is to negotiate with other countries.’ Johnson said Trump told him Tuesday night that ‘there are almost 70 countries that are [in] some stage in negotiation of more fair-trade agreement agreements with the United States. I think that is in the interest of the American people. I think that is an ‘America First’ policy that will be effective, and so we have to give them the space to do it.’” [ABC News,&nbsp;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-gop-moves-prevent-votes-rescinding-trump-tariffs/story?id=120644968">4/9/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Vote Was The Second Use Of The Procedural Tactic To Block Votes On The Tariffs, The First Use Of It Being In March 2025.&nbsp;</strong>According to ABC News, “House Democrats, led by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., moved to force a vote on Tuesday on terminating the national emergency authority and blocking Trump's sweeping tariffs. Now, that vote is unlikely to occur. This is the second time Johnson has moved to stop the legislative calendar to prevent votes on Trump's authority on tariffs. Under House rules, these votes would typically come up within 15 calendar days but now will not if the ‘rule’ passes during the vote series Wednesday afternoon.” [ABC News,&nbsp;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-gop-moves-prevent-votes-rescinding-trump-tariffs/story?id=120644968">4/9/25</a>]</li>

<h5>If One “Aye” Vote Had Switched To A “No” On House Vote 94 The Measure Would Have Failed Instead Of Passing</h5>
<p><strong>The Measure Considered In House Vote 94 Passed By A Vote Of 216 “Ayes” To 215 “Nos,” Which Meant If One Aye Vote Had Switched To A No Vote The Measure Would Have Failed.</strong></p>

<h4>March 2025: Tiffany Voted To Protect Trump’s Tariffs</h4>
<p><strong>March 2025: Tiffany Voted For A Procedural Trick To Block Votes On The Reversal Of Trump’s Tariffs.</strong>&nbsp;In March 2025, Tom Tiffany voted for, “the bill that would provide for Congressional disapproval of, and nullify, a December 2024 IRS rule related to gross proceeds reporting by brokers involved in digital asset sales. The rule imposed reporting requirements, beginning in 2027, on non-custodial barkers who participate in the decentralized digital asset market. It also required brokers to file information returns and provide payee statements reporting gross proceeds from certain digital asset sales and transactions.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 292 to 132.

  <li><strong>The Bill Effectively Blocked The House From Voting To Reverse Trump’s Tariffs On Mexico, Canada, And China For The Next Year.&nbsp;</strong>According to the New York Times, “Republican leaders on Tuesday slipped language into a procedural measure that would prevent any resolution to end the tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China from receiving a vote this year. It passed on party lines as part of a resolution that cleared the way for a vote later Tuesday on a government spending bill needed to prevent a shutdown at the end of the week.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html">3/11/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Bill Nullified A Law That Would Allow The House And Senate To End A Disaster Declared By The President.</strong> According to the New York Times, “In this case, Republican leaders did so using a particularly unusual contortion: They essentially declared the rest of the year one long day, nullifying a law that allows the House and Senate to jointly put an end to a disaster declared by the president.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html">3/11/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The National Emergencies Act Required Consideration Of Resolutions Ending A Presidentially Declared Emergency Within Fifteen Calendar Days But Republican Leadership Included A Measure In The Bill Declaring The Rest Of The Year Did Not Constitute A Calendar Day.</strong> According to the New York Times, “The national emergency law lays out a fast-track process for Congress to consider a resolution ending a presidential emergency, requiring committee consideration within 15 calendar days after one is introduced and a floor vote within three days after that. But the language House Republicans inserted in their measure on Tuesday declared that, ‘Each day for the remainder of the 119th Congress shall not constitute a calendar day’ for the purposes of the emergency that Mr. Trump declared on Feb. 1.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-tariffs-house-gop-vote.html">3/11/25</a>]<br>&nbsp;</li>

<h3>Tiffany Supported Trump’s Devastating Tariffs, Even While The Stock Market Crashed</h3>
<h4><br>Tiffany Praised Trump’s Tariffs And Claimed They Produced “Fair Trade” While A Global Trade War Crashed The Market And Erased Trillions</h4>
<p><strong>April 3, 2025: Tiffany Argued That Countries Back Down On Tariffs And Asserted That America Had Not Received “Fair Trade.”&nbsp;</strong>According to Wisconsin Public Radio, “Tariffs actually come down when countries say, ‘OK, we’re not going to fight this tariff battle,’ said Rep. Tom Tiffany, R- Hazelhurst, in a television interview. ‘But we clearly have not had fair trade here in America.’” [Wisconsin Public Radio, <a href="https://www.wpr.org/news/wisconsin-trump-tariffs-johnson-baldwin-economic-development">4/3/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>April 2-4, 2025: The U.S. Stock Market Crashed As Trump’s Tariffs “Escalated A Global Trade War And Wiped Out Trillions Of Dollars In Value.”</strong> According to NPR, “Wall Street plummeted for a second straight day on Friday, as President Trump's tariffs escalated a global trade war and wiped out trillions of dollars in value from the U.S. stock market.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-day selloff served as the financial community's most brutal warning yet about the potential fallout of Trump's trade policy. Investors, businesses, and consumers are all expressing mounting terror about how these sweeping new taxes could upend the global economy.” [NPR, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/04/nx-s1-5352362/markets-selloff-dow-trump-tariffs">4/4/25</a>]<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2025: Trump’s Tariffs Triggered Food Price Increases In Wisconsin And Added New Costs For Households.</strong> According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, “The Midwest region, including Wisconsin, saw similar increases: overall food and beverage prices in the Midwest rose by 0.7% between July and August 2025. Between August 2024 and August 2025, the prices increased by 3.2%. […] Experts say consumers are beginning to feel the impacts of President Donald Trump's slew of tariffs, which are driving up prices for commonly imported products, such as coffee, bananas, fish and liquors. The administration's crackdown on immigration could also rattle business for Wisconsin dairy farmers and manufacturers, which rely heavily on undocumented immigrant workers.” [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2025/09/23/grocery-prices-rose-across-the-board-in-the-midwest-in-august-2025/86308349007/">9/23/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>2025: Trump’s Tariffs Prompted China’s Soybean Boycott And Caused A Collapse In U.S. Exports That Hit Midwest Farmers.</strong> According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, “China imports three-fifths of all the soybeans traded on international markets but since late May, the country has boycotted the purchase of American soybeans in response to Trump's tariffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the largest buyer of American soybeans, China has not purchased a single shipment since May, according to USDA data. Without Chinese imports, total U.S. soybean exports are down 23% — a 20-year low and a 12% year-over-year decrease. Midwest states, which produce most of the United States' soybeans, are feeling the impact — and could be for years to come. […] Without exports to China, a lot of U.S. soybeans will sit unused. It's not a product that can sit for many years, Rebout said, due to the higher risks of spoilage and damage associated with soybeans compared to other grains like corn.” [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/2025/10/07/u-s-to-see-record-crop-yields-as-farmers-struggle-under-trump-tariffs/86550248007/">10/7/25</a>]</p>
