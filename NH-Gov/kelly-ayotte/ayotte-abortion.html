The bill would specify that rights established by the bill may not be restricted by certain requirements or limitations related to abortion services, including prohibitions on abortion prior to fetal viability, or after fetal viability if a provider determines that continuation of a pregnancy would pose a risk to a patient's life or health; requirements that patients disclose reasons for seeking an abortion or make medically unnecessary in-person appointments; requirements that providers provide medically inaccurate information or perform specific medical tests or procedures in connection with the provision of abortion services; limitations on providers' ability to prescribe drugs based on good-faith medical judgment, provide services via telemedicine or provide immediate services when a delay would pose a risk to a patient's health; and requirements for facilities and personnel that would not apply to facilities providing medically comparable procedures. It would also prohibit requirements or limitations that are similar to those established by the bill or that impede access to abortion services and expressly or implicitly single out abortion services, providers or facilities.” The vote was on passage.

<h2>Tiffany Removed His Abortion Views From His Website Weeks Before He Announced His Gubernatorial Campaign And Walked Back Previous Anti-Choice Views</h2>

<h4>Tiffany Removed His Views On Abortion, Gun Control, And The National Deficit From His Campaign Website</h4>
<p><strong>HEADLINE: “Rep. Tom Tiffany Erases Abortion, Gun Rights And Other Issues From Personal Website”&nbsp;</strong>[Milwaukee Journal, <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/07/tiffany-erases-hot-button-issues-like-abortion-from-website-bice/86438816007/">10/7/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>September 2025: Weeks Before His Gubernatorial Announcement, Tiffany Removed His Views On Abortion, Gun Control, And The National Deficit From His Website.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Milwaukee Journal, “When you've been in state and federal office for as long as U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, it's impossible to erase your political past. But you can certainly try. The Wayback Machine, which preserves snapshots of websites, shows that Tiffany had a webpage as of Sept. 17 that listed a bunch of hot-button issues and his positions on them. That includes abortion, gun rights, immigration, crime and communist China. But check tomtiffany.com today, and you'll notice that the ‘issues’ page is gone, replaced by a list of bland ‘solutions,’ such as ‘Protect what makes Wisconsin great’ and ‘Lower costs for every Wisconsinite.’ The new ‘solutions’ page makes no mention of guns, one mention of immigration and China and nothing on the deficit or abortion. But here's what is interesting about this: Tiffany and his team made the switch in the days leading up to his announcement on Sept. 23 that he is running as a Republican for Wisconsin governor in 2026.” [Milwaukee Journal, <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/07/tiffany-erases-hot-button-issues-like-abortion-from-website-bice/86438816007/">10/7/25</a>]</p>

<p><strong>September 2025: When Asked About His Previous Support For A More Extreme 6-Week Abortion Ban Without Exceptions, Tiffany Said He Would Uphold Wisconsin’s Current Abortion Law In Place.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Milwaukee Journal, “When asked directly by conservative talk show host Dan O'Donnell about his support for the 2022 proposal to ban abortions after six weeks with no exceptions for rape and incest, Tiffany distanced himself from the bill, which was called the ‘Heartbeat Protection Act’ of 2021. ‘So that is not my position,’ Tiffany said. ‘And you know this — when I talk to friends, relatives and constituents, this is really a personal issue.’&nbsp;&nbsp;O'Donnell asked if he would veto a bill with a ban on abortions after five or six weeks. ‘I'm going to uphold the law that is currently in place. That's the position that I'm going to take,’ Tiffany said.” [Milwaukee Journal, <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/07/tiffany-erases-hot-button-issues-like-abortion-from-website-bice/86438816007/">10/7/25</a>]<br>&nbsp;</p>
