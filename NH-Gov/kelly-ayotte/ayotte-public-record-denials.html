<h2>Tiffany Championed Trump’s Attempts To Overturn The 2020 Election&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>Tiffany Was The Only Member Of Congress From Wisconsin That Supported The Texas Lawsuit Seeking To Overturn The 2020 Election Results</h3>
<p><strong>2020: Tiffany Was The Only Member Of Congress From Wisconsin That Supported The Texas Lawsuit Seeking To Overturn The 2020 Election Results.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Badger Project, “U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany was the only Wisconsin member of Congress to publicly support an extraordinarily unusual and rejected lawsuit last week in which Texas asked the Supreme Court to flip the electoral votes in four states where President Donald Trump narrowly lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;Election experts and politicians from both parties slammed the suit — aimed at Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — as a cynical attempt to disregard the will of voters.&nbsp;[…] Tiffany explained his support in an email Tuesday to The Badger Project.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘As I have said before, this is bigger than President Trump or Joe Biden,’ he said. ‘This lawsuit is about the integrity of our system. Every legal vote must be counted, credible complaints of fraud and irregularities must be investigated, and legitimate legal challenges must be heard and addressed by our independent judiciary.’” [Badger Project, <a href="https://thebadgerproject.org/2020/12/14/tiffany-sole-wisconsin-rep-to-sign-document-asking-scotus-to-flip-election-results-in-wisconsin-3-other-swing-states/#:~:text=Tom%20Tiffany%20was,the%20Supreme%20Court%20to%20flip">12/14/20</a>]</p>

<h3>Tiffany Objected To Certify Biden’s 2020 Presidential Win In Arizona And Pennsylvania</h3>
<p><strong>2021: Tiffany Objected To Certify Biden’s 2020 Presidential Win In Arizona And Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Associated Press,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>“Two Wisconsin Republicans objected to certifying Joe Biden’s victories in a pair of states before his win was confirmed in a meeting of Congress that was interrupted by the storming of the Capitol by a violent mob loyal to President Donald Trump.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reps. Tom Tiffany and Scott Fitzgerald, the state’s two newest members of Congress, objected to certifying votes in Arizona and Pennsylvania. Those were the only two states where votes on objection were taken.” [Associated Press, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-wisconsin-elections-electoral-college-0657e37b099f9efaf7cfd8ce1bbe31de">1/7/21</a>]<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Congressional Integrity Project Listed Tiffany As A Key Player Behind The January 6<sup>th</sup> Insurrection</h3>
<p><strong>A Report From The Congressional Integrity Project Listed Tiffany As A Key “Election Denier And Insurrection Apologist” Behind The January 6<sup>th</sup> Insurrection And Attempts To Impeach Biden.&nbsp;</strong>According to The Guardian, “The attempted US coup of 6 January 2021, never ended, according to a watchdog report, since the same Donald Trump allies behind that insurrection are now leading a sham impeachment effort against Joe Biden. The report, marking three years since a mob of Trump supporters ransacked the US Capitol in a bid to overturn his election defeat, was produced by the Congressional Integrity Project and obtained by the Guardian. It argues that scores of Trump loyalists in the House of Representatives have continued to push the former president’s election lies and are ready to go further in a bid to put him back in the White House. […] The report names other key ‘election deniers and insurrection apologists’ in Congress such as Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, Pete Sessions of Texas, Byron Donalds of Florida, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Matt Gaetz of Florida, Troy Nehls of Texas, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Dan Bishop of North Carolina, Greg Steube of Florida, Tom Tiffany of Wisconsin, Scott Fitzgerald of Wisconsin and Cliff Bentz of Oregon.” [The Guardian,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/05/donald-trump-january-6-supporters-behind-joe-biden-impeachment">1/5/24</a>]</p>
