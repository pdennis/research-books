# Congressional Campaigns

### Summary

> * Andy Ogles won Tennessee’s 5th Congressional District seat in 2022, flipping a Democratic stronghold after a controversial GOP-led redistricting, and won re-election in 2024 with strong support from former President Donald Trump and major national conservative groups ([Nashville Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66TP-SVR1-DXVP-V398-00000-00), [Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DC5-P5C1-DXGX-621J-00000-00)).
> 
> * Both 2022 and 2024 campaigns relied heavily on outside spending and endorsements, particularly from Americans for Prosperity Action and the House Freedom Caucus, along with early and visible support from Donald Trump ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CD3-77N1-JB1V-G034-00000-00), [Chattanooga Times Free Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CMN-5X91-JBP6-R007-00000-00)).
> 
> * Ogles often faced criticism for misstating fundraising figures, late campaign disclosures, and for falsely reporting a $320,000 self-loan, leading to FEC complaints and multiple investigations ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FHT-2WB3-RVR5-53PP-00000-00), [Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CFT-0RC1-JB1V-G1G1-00000-00)).
> 
> * His campaigns were marked by minimal traditional public engagement: Ogles repeatedly declined debates, rarely granted media interviews, and did not hold in-person town halls while still winning by double-digit margins ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DC5-P5C1-DXGX-621J-00000-00), [Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FJ1-1WG3-RTBR-P4J1-00000-00)).
> 
> * Despite facing well-funded primary and general election challenges—including from Republican Courtney Johnston in 2024—Ogles prevailed, in part due to strong rural support and strategic backing from conservative PACs ([Commercial Appeal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CN4-8DR1-DXGX-628S-00000-00), [Nashville Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CN4-3R81-DXVP-T40W-00000-00)).
> 
> * Ogles’ continued vulnerabilities include unresolved campaign finance controversies, ongoing FEC scrutiny, and criticism for lack of transparency and constituent engagement, which have made him a Democratic target in competitive district lists ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FHT-2WB3-RVR5-53PP-00000-00), [Oak Ridger](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FJ1-1W13-RT09-42V6-00000-00)).
