Andy Ogles has repeatedly pushed policies that would make health care more expensive and harder to access. He twice introduced bills to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, which lowered drug prices, capped insulin costs, and limited seniors’ out-of-pocket spending. He also voted for legislation requiring Medicaid recipients to prove they work at least 80 hours a month—rules that studies show cause millions to lose coverage due to paperwork, not income. The same law added new red tape to Affordable Care Act enrollment, making it easier to lose insurance and harder to sign up. Ogles also sponsored national bans on medication abortion, which is used in most abortions today. Overall, his record would undo cost protections for seniors, shrink health coverage, and add bureaucracy for millions of Americans.

### Ogles sponsored a bill to repeal laws that lower drug and health costs for seniors via negotiation
- In 2023, Ogles introduced H.R. 812 to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) and rescind its funds. ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/812))
- In 2025, he again introduced H.R. 191 to repeal the IRA. ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/191/text))
- The IRA lowers Medicare drug costs by enabling Medicare drug price negotiation, capping insulin at $35/month, making ACIP-recommended adult vaccines free, and adding a $2,000 annual Part D out-of-pocket cap starting in 2025; repealing it would remove these cost protections.

### He voted for Medicaid requirements that reduce coverage increase paperwork requirements on families 
- Ogles voted Yea on the House passage of H.R. 1 (“One Big Beautiful Bill Act”) on May 22, 2025 (Roll Call 145). ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/145))
- That law requires many Medicaid expansion adults to document at least 80 hours/month of work, community service, education, or a combination, with states verifying compliance at application and redetermination; states cannot waive the requirement. ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/summary/55))
- Nonpartisan analyses project large coverage losses primarily due to administrative barriers: CBO/KFF estimated about 5.2 million would lose Medicaid coverage in 2034 from the work-requirement provision, with millions more uninsured overall under the package. ([kff.org](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/a-closer-look-at-the-work-requirement-provisions-in-the-2025-federal-budget-reconciliation-law/))
- Real-world evidence shows paperwork burdens cause coverage loss: when Arkansas piloted a Medicaid work requirement in 2018, more than 18,000 people lost coverage before courts halted the policy. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/a62460a816216faae450155fcd18317e))

### He backed ACA marketplace changes that make coverage harder to keep and more expensive
- The same H.R. 1 narrows ACA marketplace access by ending automatic reenrollment for people receiving premium tax credits, adding new income and eligibility verifications, eliminating provisional eligibility while determinations are pending, and shortening open enrollment—changes the American Hospital Association says will add administrative burden and make millions lose coverage. ([aha.org](https://www.aha.org/fact-sheets/2025-06-05-fact-sheet-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-would-significantly-reduce-availability-coverage-health-insurance))
- KFF estimates that combined changes to Medicaid and the ACA in the package, plus the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits the law did not extend, will leave about 16 million more people uninsured in 2034 than otherwise.

### He led efforts to ban medication abortion nationwide, restricting a major component of health care
- Ogles sponsored the Ending Chemical Abortions Act (H.R. 5806 in 2023) and reintroduced it in 2025 to federally ban medication abortions. ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5806/cosponsors))
- Medication abortion accounted for 63% of U.S. abortions in 2023; banning it would eliminate the most common method and reduce availability of reproductive health services. ([guttmacher.org](https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/medication-abortion-accounted-63-all-us-abortions-2023-increase-53-2020))

### He sought to roll back Medicare’s new drug price negotiation and senior cost protections
- Because Ogles’s repeal bills target the IRA wholesale, they would also undo Medicare’s drug price negotiation program that KFF and CBO project will lower Part D premiums and out-of-pocket costs over time.
