In 2014, Andy Ogles raised nearly $25,000 through a GoFundMe campaign called “Lincoln’s Place,” saying the money would build a children’s burial garden with benches and a statue to honor his stillborn son. Reporters later found that no garden was ever built, and cemetery officials said Ogles never followed through despite offers to help. When questioned, Ogles gave no records showing how the money was used and changed his explanation several times—first claiming regulations stopped the project, then saying the funds weren’t enough, and later that the goal had shifted to helping families directly. He provided no proof of any such spending, and at least one donor asked for and received a refund after he couldn’t account for the money.

### The promised project was never built, and local professionals say he never followed through
- Reporters physically checked the cemetery where donors expected the memorial and found no children’s burial garden, no benches, and no statue.

- Contemporaneous pricing showed burial plots at the family’s cemetery cost about $1,200 in 2014—meaning the funds could have purchased many plots—and two cemeteries said they were willing to work with him.
