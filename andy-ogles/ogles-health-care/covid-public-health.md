# COVID-19 and Public Health Policies

### Summary

> * Ogles consistently opposed mask mandates and COVID-19 restrictions, even when given authority to implement them, potentially positioning himself against public health guidance during surges and risking criticism for prioritizing personal liberty over collective safety ([Daily Herald](https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/story/news/politics/county/2020/07/08/maury-county-mayor-encourages-public-to-pickup-free-masks-after-not-implementing-mandate/41723899/), [Tennessean](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/williamson/2021/07/20/nashville-tennessee-housing-hot-market-covid-restrictions-homebuyers/7970510002/)).
> * He linked state and federal COVID regulations to economic harm and repeatedly called for early lifting of restrictions, drawing praise from some but strong criticism from others who saw his approach as undermining coordinated pandemic response ([Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:61K6-TSJ1-DXVP-V4B7-00000-00&context=1519360), [Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:601N-F641-JBCN-40N3-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles often cited constitutional or legal concerns to reject mandates, but was challenged for potentially overstating these issues and for promoting personal responsibility over enforceable measures, raising questions about the adequacy of his public health leadership ([Columbia Daily Herald](https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/story/news/politics/county/2020/07/08/maury-county-mayor-encourages-public-to-pickup-free-masks-after-not-implementing-mandate/41723899/), [Leaf-Chronicle](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66RS-47J1-DXGX-612D-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * His public comments sometimes minimized the severity of the pandemic, drew backlash for statements such as calling COVID a "fake pandemic" (later clarified), and for comparing COVID risks to car accidents and the flu, which opponents argued undermined trust in the seriousness of the crisis ([FOX 17](https://fox17.com/news/local/maury-county-mayor-under-fire-for-facebook-posts-about-covid-19-joe-biden), [Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:609J-C4N1-JBCN-42B2-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles took highly visible symbolic actions against vaccine mandates—including issuing a county-level emergency and voicing willingness to go to jail rather than enforce federal vaccine or mask orders—which, while boosting his conservative credentials, may alienate moderate voters or those prioritizing public health ([Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:64HR-VT61-JBCN-404D-00000-00&context=1519360), [Tennessean](https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/2022/07/15/tennessee-aug-4-election-andy-ogles-candidate-congress-district-5/10066569002/)).
