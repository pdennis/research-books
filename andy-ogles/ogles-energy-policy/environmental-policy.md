# Environmental Policy Positions

### Summary

> * Andy Ogles supported pursuing a long-term regional waste solution for Middle Tennessee, favoring a landfill approach that would last 50 to 70 years over temporary or reactionary measures ([Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5XSJ-DSF1-JBCN-4095-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * He indicated willingness to consider hosting a regional landfill in Maury County if certain conditions were met, emphasizing the potential $2 million annual revenue benefit while promising to oppose any mega-dump or radioactive waste facility in the region ([Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5XSJ-DSF1-JBCN-4095-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles stressed the importance of transparency and informed decision-making, vowing to share state-provided information with the public and to engage residents in choosing the best solution for the county ([Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5XSJ-DSF1-JBCN-4095-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Discussions were reported between Ogles and Columbia Mayor Chaz Molder about the potential waste facility, but no formal agreements were reached ([Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5XSJ-DSF1-JBCN-4095-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * A potential vulnerability exists in the public’s reaction to the idea of hosting a regional landfill; despite promised safeguards, the facility’s impact and the scope of what type of waste it would handle could generate local opposition.
