# Energy Policy Stances

### Summary

> * Andy Ogles has repeatedly opposed federal energy efficiency standards for appliances, sponsoring bills like the Hot Showers Act and the Liberty in Laundry Act to curb Department of Energy and EPA regulations on water heaters and clothes washers, calling such measures burdensome and "woke" ([Tennessee Lookout](https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/11/27/an-andy-ogles-case-study-stupidity-as-tactic-lifestyle-or-default/), [Ledger: Knoxville Edition](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BWK-WKG1-DXVP-T19V-00000-00&context=1519360), [Ledger: Nashville Edition](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BWK-WKF1-DXVP-T0W2-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles frames Biden administration climate and appliance policies as "climate tyranny" and claims they harm consumers by driving up appliance prices and restricting non-electric technologies ([Tennessee Lookout](https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/11/27/an-andy-ogles-case-study-stupidity-as-tactic-lifestyle-or-default/)).
> * He is strongly opposed to "Green New Deal" initiatives, arguing they put America at a disadvantage and target consumers negatively ([Tennessee Lookout](https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/11/27/an-andy-ogles-case-study-stupidity-as-tactic-lifestyle-or-default/)).
> * Ogles supports increasing domestic energy production through expanded drilling and pipeline construction, and has called for rolling back EPA regulations on farms to boost energy independence ([The Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65WX-4YT1-JBCN-421F-00000-00&context=1519360), [The Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65WG-C621-DXGX-6130-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * He has also advocated for eliminating the Tennessee state gas tax established by the IMPROVE Act, citing the need to alleviate fuel costs ([The Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65WX-4YT1-JBCN-421F-00000-00&context=1519360), [The Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65WG-C621-DXGX-6130-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Potential vulnerability: Ogles' criticism of energy efficiency standards as "woke" overlooks that federal appliance standards date back decades, which may weaken claims that current measures are unprecedented or uniquely partisan ([Tennessee Lookout](https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/11/27/an-andy-ogles-case-study-stupidity-as-tactic-lifestyle-or-default/)).


### Opposition to Federal Regulation in Energy Sector

**2023: Andy Ogles Introduced Hot Showers Act Targeting DOE Water Heater Standards** According to an editorial published in Tennessee Lookout, "Ogles proudly proclaimed in a tweet, ‘I introduced the Hot Showers Act to require the Department of Energy to stop its climate tyranny and allow the free market to dictate the price of appliances, not woke energy elitists.’ He added in a news release ‘Joe Biden’s climate crusade has gone too far. He has weaponized the federal rulemaking process to place non-electric technology off the market artificially. When it seemed like prices couldn’t get any higher, this rule continues that trend and bankrupts consumers even more.’ He finished his bloviating of right-wing buzzwords with, ‘I will always fight against any ‘Green New Deal’ directive that actively targets consumers and puts America last. Dealing with big government is stressful enough, and a good cure for those woes is a long hot shower. But, like most good things, Joe Biden wants to take that away from you too.’" [Editorial - Tennessee Lookout, [11/27/23](https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/11/27/an-andy-ogles-case-study-stupidity-as-tactic-lifestyle-or-default/)]
