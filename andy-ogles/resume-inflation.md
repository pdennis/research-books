Rep. Andy Ogles has repeatedly exaggerated his background, claiming to be an economist, law-enforcement officer, and international expert despite limited experience in those areas. He often introduced himself as “an economist,” even in congressional settings, though records show he majored in Liberal Studies and took only one community-college economics class, earning a C. He also called himself a former law-enforcement officer who worked in “international sex crimes,” but he served only briefly as a volunteer reserve deputy before being dismissed for not meeting training standards. His “international” work referred to a short, part-time administrative role at a nonprofit, not any investigative position. Ogles also inflated his education, saying he did graduate work at Vanderbilt and Dartmouth when he had only completed short, non-degree certificate programs. While he promoted himself as a “nationally recognized expert,” evidence shows just a handful of opinion pieces from his lobbying days, not the record of a professional economist or policy scholar.

### Ogles repeatedly claimed to be an economist despite lacking formal economics training
- Ogles repeatedly introduced himself as “an economist” in C‑SPAN interviews and even in a House Financial Services Committee setting; local investigators compiled multiple instances of this claim.

- His own college transcript shows he majored in Liberal Studies and took just one community‑college economics course, earning a C. ([newschannel5.com](https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/tennessee-congressman-andy-ogles-didnt-want-you-to-see-his-college-transcript-we-got-it-anyway))
- After questions were raised, he acknowledged on February 26–28, 2023, that he had been “mistaken” about previously stating his degree was in International Relations. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/1f3c2b55a43b85bb649f04eb8cb29373))
- When pressed about the “economist” label, he defended it by pointing to his advocacy/lobbying work on economic and tax policy, not to academic training.

### Ogles exaggerated law‑enforcement and “international sex crimes”/human‑trafficking expertise
- On the trail and in interviews, Ogles described himself as a former member of law enforcement who “worked in international sex crimes” and “worked in human trafficking.” ([newschannel5.com](https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/businessman-economist-cop-international-sex-crimes-expert-the-stories-of-congressman-andy-ogles))
- Records show he served only as a volunteer reserve deputy in Williamson County (sworn in July 2009) and lost that position two years later for failing to meet standards and training requirements. ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/10/tennessee-congressman-andrew-ogless-rsum-is-too-good-be-true/))
- The Williamson County Sheriff’s Office stated there is nothing in his training or personnel file indicating involvement in “international sex trafficking” during his reserve stint. ([newschannel5.com](https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/businessman-economist-cop-international-sex-crimes-expert-the-stories-of-congressman-andy-ogles))
- His cited “international sex crimes” experience corresponds to a part‑time COO role at the anti‑trafficking nonprofit Abolition International that paid $4,000 in 2011 — not a law‑enforcement post. ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/10/tennessee-congressman-andrew-ogless-rsum-is-too-good-be-true/))
- Ogles’ site touted overseeing operations in “12 countries” at that nonprofit; reporting found the claim overstated and later revised, and tax records show the role was part‑time.

### Ogles inflated business‑school credentials and expert stature
- He claimed “graduate work” at Vanderbilt’s Owen and Dartmouth’s Tuck business schools; records show he completed non‑degree executive‑education certificates, including brief online modules (some listed as 2–3 hours). ([newschannel5.com](https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/congressman-andy-ogles-graduate-of-respected-vanderbilt-dartmouth-business-schools-not-really))
- While running for Maury County mayor in 2018, he billed himself as an “economist, tax policy expert” and claimed graduate education at Vanderbilt; when pressed at a forum, he clarified it was only “executive education.” ([newschannel5.com](https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/congressman-andy-ogles-graduate-of-respected-vanderbilt-dartmouth-business-schools-not-really))
- He also touted being a “nationally recognized expert” featured by top outlets, but reviewers found only a few opinion columns under his name (often from prior lobbying work) rather than independent expert citations.
