'There's not a lot of room to trim because the way the law is written. I think this year's budget will largely resemble last years, whether that be from the school, sheriff's department or county offices. We're all going to be asked to hold the line for operating expenses,' he said."

'We did have had a surge in purchasing at the beginning of this, so what impact did that surge have in the end?'"
