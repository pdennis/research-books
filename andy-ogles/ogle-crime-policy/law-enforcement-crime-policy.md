# Law Enforcement and Crime Policy

### Summary

> * Andy Ogles has repeatedly criticized federal law enforcement, including calling for slashing the FBI’s budget, labeling the agency as "corrupt," and condemning the Department of Justice for "weaponizing" the FBI in connection with the Mar-a-Lago search ([Tennessee Tribune](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66SD-BMR1-DY0W-44VC-00000-00&context=1519360), [Tennessee Lookout](https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/10/04/tennessees-new-5th-congressional-district-features-trump-republican-vs-progressive-democrat/)).
> * Ogles has promoted tough-on-crime policies, including a proposed bill in 2024 to allow the death penalty for unlawful migrants who assault, rape, or kill U.S. citizens, specifically targeting those who attack women and children ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CGD-XDB1-JB1V-G3SD-00000-00&context=1519360), [Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CGD-XCT1-DXGX-64N6-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Following mass shootings, including the Covenant School tragedy in his district, Ogles supported arming teachers and school staff and criticized media coverage, co-sponsoring resolutions that urge responsible reporting to prevent glorification of perpetrators ([Nashville Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:690Y-JMT1-DXVP-T0S7-00000-00&context=1519360), [Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6908-GY61-DXGX-655X-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles has been an outspoken critic of Congressional actions on opioid legislation, calling for more aggressive federal enforcement and blaming Congress for being influenced by special interests ([Nashville Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5PRW-TBN1-JBCN-424M-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Vulnerability: Ogles' advocacy for arming teachers and his frequent criticism of federal law enforcement may attract controversy and opposition from those who question the effectiveness or safety of such policies or view his rhetoric as undermining trust in key institutions.
