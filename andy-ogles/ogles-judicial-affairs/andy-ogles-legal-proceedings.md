# Legal and Judicial Proceedings Involving Andy Ogles

### Summary

> * Andy Ogles has been a leading figure in filing articles of impeachment against multiple federal judges, particularly those who have ruled against the Trump administration’s positions ([Tennessee Lookout](https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/03/06/secretive-d-c-influence-project-appears-to-be-running-a-group-house-for-right-wing-lawmakers/), [Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/3/30/theodore-chuang-impeachment-resolution/), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/republican-lawmaker-seeks-us-judges-impeachment-over-foreign-aid-ruling-2025-02-27/)).
> * In early 2025, Ogles organized and promoted public impeachment efforts, including hosting an "impeachathon" event with other Republican lawmakers to target judges viewed as hostile to the administration ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/republican-lawmaker-seeks-us-judges-impeachment-over-foreign-aid-ruling-2025-02-27/)).
> * Ogles is under ongoing legal scrutiny for alleged campaign finance violations, with the FBI confiscating his phone in August 2024 and a congressional investigation underway regarding a possibly fabricated $320,000 campaign contribution ([Daily News Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CPM-2N41-DXGX-6495-00000-00&context=1519360), [NewsChannel 5](https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/congressman-andy-ogles-faces-fec-complaint-over-numerous-discrepancies-in-campaign-reports)).
> * Ogles has publicly and repeatedly denounced legal proceedings against Donald Trump, attending the 2024 hush money trial and labeling it "political persecution" and "election interference" ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C2G-JBS1-DXGX-64W4-00000-00&context=1519360), [The Jackson Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C2P-HFC1-JB1V-G2D6-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * The ethics and legal vulnerabilities related to Ogles’ campaign finances, as well as his aggressive use of impeachment against judges, suggest ongoing and significant legal exposure.
