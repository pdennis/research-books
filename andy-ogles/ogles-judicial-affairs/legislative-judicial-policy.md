# Legislative Activity and Judicial Policy Stances

### Summary

> * Andy Ogles repeatedly argued that the U.S. justice system is "two-tiered" and weaponized against political opponents, specifically framing Donald Trump's trials as "a joke" and "persecution" by "woke and corrupt" judges ([The Jackson Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C2P-HFC1-JB1V-G2D6-00000-00&context=1519360), [Oak Ridger](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C2P-HFC1-JB1V-G3P7-00000-00&context=1519360), [Commercial Appeal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C2X-GHT1-JB1V-G1S3-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles led a press conference outside the Trump trial courthouse alongside other pro-Trump lawmakers, where they criticized the proceedings and personally attacked key witnesses Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels ([Leaf-Chronicle](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C2P-HFC1-JB1V-G1GH-00000-00&context=1519360), [The Commercial Appeal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C2X-GHT1-JB1V-G1S3-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * In Congress, Ogles introduced legislation to defund special prosecutor Jack Smith’s salary, drawing criticism from Democratic opponents who called it a dereliction of constitutional duty ([Chattanooga Times Free Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:693C-XWF1-DY58-F000-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles has advanced impeachment efforts targeting federal judges, accusing them of eroding presidential powers or pushing "critical race theory"; he recently displayed a list of such judges and publicly criticized judicial tenures and decisions, including those related to foreign aid and LGBTQ+ issues ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/republican-lawmaker-seeks-us-judges-impeachment-over-foreign-aid-ruling-2025-02-27/), [Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/3/30/theodore-chuang-impeachment-resolution/)).
> * Ogles’ rhetoric and legislative activity reveal a pattern of attacking judicial independence and undermining public trust in legal processes, which critics suggest poses constitutional and institutional risks.
