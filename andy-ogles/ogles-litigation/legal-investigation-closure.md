# Withdrawal and Closure of Legal Investigations

### Summary

> * Seizure of Rep. Andy Ogles’ phone and email by federal investigators during a campaign finance probe generated questions about his handling of sensitive information and the legal boundaries of congressional communications ([Nashville Banner](https://nashvillebanner.com/2024/09/16/representative-ogles-financial-disclosures/), [Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FHT-2WB3-RVR5-53PP-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles’ legal team claimed protected legislative materials were on seized devices, potentially bringing congressional privilege into conflict with law enforcement and raising concerns about transparency ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CXC-8JF1-DXGX-6164-00000-00&context=1519360), [NewsChannel 5](https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/tennessee-congressman-andy-ogles-stalls-fbi-investigation-with-behind-the-scenes-court-battle)).
> * Ogles publicly stated he was a "subject" rather than a "target" of the federal probe, which may still leave uncertainty about the nature and seriousness of the investigation ([Knoxville News-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CXC-8JF1-DXGX-616K-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Allegations of political motivation in the investigation—especially claims that the FBI probe was retribution for Ogles’ impeachment actions—could polarize opinion and undermine public trust ([Leaf-Chronicle](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CXK-7WK1-DXGX-63RF-00000-00&context=1519360), [Jackson Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CXK-7WK1-DXGX-64J7-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * The sudden withdrawal of the federal investigation, including after changes in presidential administration, may fuel perceptions of partisan influence or irregularity in the handling of legal matters ([Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F1Y-4C83-RT2Y-92F5-00000-00&context=1519360), [Knoxville News-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FNM-JB83-RRHC-D4KJ-00000-00&context=1519360)).
