**2020: Ogles Was Alleged To Have Spread False COVID-19 Information On Official Facebook Page** According to Daily Herald, 'Our clients believe that many of the more than 230 live videos your office has posted on the Facebook page are error-laden and do not give constituents honest facts,' the letter states. 'Many of these individuals have also expressed concern with your refusal to implement a mask mandate in the county-- despite medical professionals with the CDC and the Tennessee Department of Health opining that mask mandates would save lives.' [Daily Herald, [12/27/20](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:61M8-P0T1-JBCN-411B-00000-00&context=1519360)]

**2020: Attorneys Asserted That Ogles Used Facebook For Official Government Communications** According to Daily Herald, "Teets, a former executive director of the Tennessee Democratic Party, said it is up to the court to review at how the Facebook page is used and evaluate whether it is used for official government purposes. 'The Facebook page has become an official channel and medium of communications for the mayor's office,' Teets said. 'We believe the mayor is engaging in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination by selectively restricting the ability of some individuals from commenting on the Facebook page.'"
