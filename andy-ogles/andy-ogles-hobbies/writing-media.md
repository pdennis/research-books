# Writing and Media Engagement

### Summary

> * Since being elected, Andy Ogles has made few public appearances, instead favoring friendly news outlets and occasionally appearing on Fox News to criticize Democrats ([Nashville Scene](https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/coverstory/pleading-the-5th-rep-andy-ogles-stumbles-into-congress/article_f4b9e4bc-edd7-11ed-ab4b-bbed5a52185a.html)).
> * Ogles has maintained an active conservative presence in Tennessee through social media and frequent speaking engagements at conservative events, where he has often criticized Governor Lee ([Commercial Appeal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:63C4-0GY1-DYJJ-P0WY-00000-00&context=1519360), [Leaf-Chronicle](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:63C9-YS41-JC3H-02C8-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles has used social media extensively, both to share public safety messages and to post provocative memes—most notably during August 2020, when memes mocking Joe Biden and referencing Kim Jong-un generated outrage and online controversy ([Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60KY-P861-JBCN-42Y4-00000-00&context=1519360), [Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60MJ-FMB1-JC3H-037N-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * In response to backlash over these memes, Ogles defended his posts, referencing Kim Jong-un’s record, and pledged to post similar content daily, a move that reinforced support among conservatives but drew criticism from other constituents ([Daily News Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60MJ-FMB1-JC3H-035Y-00000-00&context=1519360), [Leaf-Chronicle](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60N0-WRV1-JC3H-04KN-00000-00&context=1519360)).

> * Potential vulnerability: Ogles has been reported as amplifying talking points from controversial media outlets, including Tenet Media, potentially exposing him to criticism for spreading misinformation ([Nashville Scene](https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/pithinthewind/tenet-media-russian-propaganda/article_2f5f1514-6ba5-11ef-a6bb-73b376b81c8a.html)).
