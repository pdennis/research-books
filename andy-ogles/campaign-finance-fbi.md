Multiple investigations have found serious problems with Rep. Andy Ogles’ campaign finances. In 2024, he quietly changed 11 FEC reports, erasing a $320,000 “self-loan” and admitting it was only $20,000. The Office of Congressional Ethics said there was “substantial reason to believe” he misreported key details, and watchdog groups accused him of falsifying records to hide illegal contributions. Reporters also found campaign payments to fake or suspicious vendors, and Ogles repeatedly failed to file required financial disclosures. The FBI launched a criminal investigation, seizing his phone and email in mid-2024, and Ogles was reelected while still under federal scrutiny. But after Trump returned to power in 2025, the Justice Department abruptly pulled local prosecutors off the case and moved it to Washington—an unusual step seen as a sign the probe would be dropped. Lawmakers and watchdogs have warned that ending the investigation for political reasons would amount to protecting an ally, raising major questions about Ogles’ honesty and fitness for office.

### After the Trump administration took office in 2025, DOJ actions curtailed the probe and signaled plans to drop it
- In early 2025, career federal prosecutors in Nashville withdrew from the Ogles investigation, and DOJ shifted the matter to headquarters in Washington, an “unprecedented” move local reporters said could signal plans to drop the case.

([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/legal/justice-department-seeks-dismissal-charges-against-new-york-mayor-ny-times-says-2025-02-10/))

### Ogles introduced a constitutional amendment tailored to allow Donald Trump a third term
- On Jan. 23, 2025, Ogles introduced a House joint resolution to amend the 22nd Amendment to permit up to three presidential election wins; his official release explicitly framed it as enabling Trump to serve a third term. ([ogles.house.gov](https://ogles.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-ogles-proposes-amending-22nd-amendment-allow-trump-serve-third-term))

### After Ogles’s amendment, DOJ actions removed career prosecutors from his case and shifted control to Main Justice amid broader political interventions
- Local career prosecutors in Nashville abruptly withdrew from the Ogles investigation, with the matter reassigned to DOJ headquarters; investigative reporting called the step unprecedented and a possible signal the case would be dropped.
