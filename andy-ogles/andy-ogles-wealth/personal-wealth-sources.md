# Sources of Personal Wealth

### Summary

> * Andy Ogles repeatedly claimed to have personally loaned his campaign $320,000 in 2022, despite financial disclosures that failed to show he had sufficient funds or bank accounts to support this claim ([NewsChannel 5](https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/revealed/he-doesnt-report-having-checking-or-savings-so-where-did-andy-ogles-get-320-000-for-campaign), [MSNBC](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ethics-troubles-gops-andy-ogles-become-even-serious-rcna186362), [Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C40-BBS1-DXGX-60J0-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * In 2024, Ogles admitted the $320,000 campaign loan was inaccurately reported and was, in fact, a non-executed pledge; amended disclosures showed he only loaned about $20,000 and claimed funds had been set aside in a joint account, but were never used for the campaign ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C40-BBS1-DXGX-60J0-00000-00&context=1519360), [Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C40-BBB1-DXGX-648R-00000-00&context=1519360), [Chattanooga Times Free Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D18-RB01-JBP6-R28P-00000-00&context=1519360)).
