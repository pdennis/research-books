# Investments and Assets

### Summary

> * In 2023, Andy Ogles sold an investment property at a $60,000 loss to his Congressional district director, James Amundsen, according to multiple sources and property records ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CH2-TWJ1-JB1V-G2CK-00000-00&context=1519360), [Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CNS-6DY1-DXGX-61NS-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles reported differing investment property values on Congressional disclosure forms, sometimes undervaluing properties (e.g., listing one as $250,000–$500,000 instead of $660,000) ([Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CH2-TWJ1-JB1V-G119-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * His financial disclosure for 2023 lists an investment property in Columbia, Tennessee, worth between $500,001 and $1 million, generating $5,001–$15,000 in annual rental income, and notes a significant decrease in his 401(k) from previous years ([Chattanooga Times Free Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D15-WDC1-DY58-F35D-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Some details in Ogles's property holdings and investment disclosures do not align with Maury County property records, raising questions about documentation and accuracy ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D1B-W5F1-DXGX-60G1-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles claimed rental income for a Maury County property valued at $500,000–$1 million on disclosures, but no such property is listed under his name in county records, highlighting a potential vulnerability ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D1B-W5F1-DXGX-60G1-00000-00&context=1519360)).
