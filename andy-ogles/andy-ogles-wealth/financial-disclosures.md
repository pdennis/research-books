> * Ogles admitted to falsely claiming a $320,000 personal loan to his 2022 campaign, later amending reports to reflect only a $20,000 loan, and was fined $5,750 by the Federal Election Commission for multiple reporting violations ([NewsChannel 5](https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/revealed/congressman-andy-ogles-admits-his-claims-to-have-loaned-320-000-to-his-campaign-were-not-true)).
> * The Campaign Legal Center filed ethics complaints against Ogles, alleging nearly $1 million in discrepancies between House disclosures and campaign finance reports, with comparisons drawn to former Congressman George Santos's conduct ([Chattanooga Times Free Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBN-M141-DY58-F0S2-00000-00&context=1519360), [NewsChannel 5](https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/congressman-andy-ogles-faces-fec-complaint-over-numerous-discrepancies-in-campaign-reports)).
