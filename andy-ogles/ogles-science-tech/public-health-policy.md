# Positions on Public Health and Science Policy

### Summary

> * Andy Ogles, as Maury County Mayor during the COVID-19 pandemic, confirmed quarantines and temporary facility closures following outbreaks among county solid waste and highway department employees ([The Daily Herald, 9/20/20](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60WK-B4P1-JBCN-43JT-00000-00&context=1519360); [Daily Herald, 9/24/20](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60X7-84J1-JBCN-44V8-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles reported operational challenges, such as staffing shortages and early closures at waste convenience centers, yet emphasized continued waste management services through cooperation with outside contractors ([The Daily Herald, 9/20/20](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60WK-B4P1-JBCN-43JT-00000-00&context=1519360); [Daily Herald, 9/24/20](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60X7-84J1-JBCN-44V8-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * He instituted sanitation measures at county facilities and limited public interaction during quarantine periods to reduce potential viral spread ([The Daily Herald, 9/20/20](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60WK-B4P1-JBCN-43JT-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Despite the ongoing threat of COVID-19, Ogles consistently opposed instituting a countywide mask mandate, citing concerns over personal freedoms ([Daily Herald, 4/13/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:62F3-CKN1-JBCN-41C0-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles advocated for planning and conducting public events in safer ways, emphasizing intentionality over mandated restrictions ([Daily Herald, 3/10/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:625V-J3R1-DXVP-V380-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * A potential vulnerability in Ogles' approach was the limited use of more assertive public health measures, such as mask mandates, which could have further mitigated COVID-19 transmission risks within the county.
