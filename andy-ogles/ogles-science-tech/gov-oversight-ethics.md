# Positions on Government Oversight, Ethics, and Financial Disclosures Related to Science and Technology

### Summary

> * Andy Ogles consistently called for greater federal transparency and public disclosure regarding records and investigations of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), alongside several congressional colleagues ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69SN-M121-JB1V-G1N5-00000-00&context=1519360), [Knoxville News-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69SN-M051-JB1V-G0XD-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles advocated for stronger congressional oversight and access to UAP records, emphasizing Congress’s “right and obligation to know” about the nature and origins of these phenomena ([Daily News Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69SN-M121-JB1V-G0KJ-00000-00&context=1519360), [Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69SW-K5C1-DXGX-60DJ-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * He highlighted the need for improved cooperation and information sharing between federal agencies involved in UAP investigations, raising concerns about national security and foreign technology threats ([Jackson Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69SW-K5C1-DXGX-61TG-00000-00&context=1519360), [The Commercial Appeal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69SW-K5C1-DXGX-615C-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles worked in a bipartisan manner with legislators from both parties to push for UAP records disclosure, showing cross-party concern about government transparency related to science and technology ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69SN-M121-JB1V-G1N5-00000-00&context=1519360), [Knoxville News-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69SN-M051-JB1V-G0XD-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Potential vulnerability: Ogles’ focus has primarily been on UAP-related transparency and oversight; there is little public information available on his positions regarding broader ethics or financial disclosure policies in science and technology.
