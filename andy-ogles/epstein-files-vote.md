In July 2025, the House came within one vote of allowing an immediate amendment to release the Epstein files, but Rep. Andy Ogles didn’t vote—his single vote could have flipped the outcome and opened the path to full disclosure. Later, Ogles backed House leadership’s alternative plan that replaced immediate release with a slower “oversight” process, limiting what could be made public. When lawmakers tried again through a discharge petition to force a vote on full release, Ogles refused to sign—even though the effort was just one signature short of success.

### A House vote that would have allowed an immediate Epstein-files release amendment was decided by one vote.
- On July 15, 2025, the House ordered the previous question on H.Res. 580 by a 211–210 margin; Democrats had specified that defeating the previous question would allow consideration of an amendment requiring the Attorney General to publish Epstein-related records within 30 days.

- The Congressional Record for that vote contains the text of the proposed amendment to compel release of the Epstein files upon defeat of the previous question. [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/119/crec/2025/07/15/171/121/modified/CREC-2025-07-15-pt1-PgH3257-5.htm)

- Under House procedure, defeating the previous question on a special rule hands control to the minority for one hour and permits a germane amendment to the rule—precisely the mechanism Democrats noticed to bring the release measure forward.

### Ogles withheld his vote on that one‑vote roll call—his single vote would have flipped the outcome.
- The official roll call for July 15 shows “NOT VOTING—11,” including Rep. Andy Ogles, on the 211–210 previous‑question vote tied to the Epstein‑files release amendment. [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/119/crec/2025/07/15/171/121/modified/CREC-2025-07-15-pt1-PgH3257-5.htm)

- Independent reporting the same day likewise notes the 211–210 tally and lists Ogles among nine Republicans who did not vote. [New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/post/197987/house-republicans-vote-block-epstein-files/)

- By House practice, a previous‑question motion requires a simple majority; if it fails (including by tie), the minority may offer its amendment—so one additional “nay” would have changed the result and allowed the release amendment to be offered. [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48316)

### Ogles then supported the leadership’s alternative that displaced immediate release with an oversight-only path.
- On September 3, 2025, Ogles voted Yea on ordering the previous question (212–209) and Yea on adopting H.Res. 672 (212–208), the rule that advanced H.Res. 668—an oversight resolution rather than the immediate-release bill. [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/member/andrew-ogles/O000175?page=3)

- The Congressional Record for September 3 lists Ogles among the Ayes on both the previous question (Roll No. 221) and adoption of the rule (Roll No. 222). [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/volume-171/issue-144/house-section/article/H3771-1)

- H.Res. 668 directed continued Oversight investigation and controlled, exception‑laden disclosures, instead of mandating the wholesale release in the Massie–Khanna bill. [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/668)

- Leadership and allies pointed to ongoing Oversight releases as a reason not to take up the stand‑alone transparency bill compelling broad, rapid publication of the files.

### When a discharge petition to force a floor vote on full release was one signature short, Ogles did not sign.
- As of late October, the discharge petition to force a vote on the Epstein Files Transparency Act had all Democrats and four Republicans—one signature short of 218. [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/21/mike-johnson-epstein-files-house-vote)

- A contemporaneous whip effort identified only four GOP signers (Reps. Massie, Greene, Boebert, and Mace), indicating other Republicans—including Ogles—had not signed.

- The Clerk’s official page for Discharge Petition No. 9 provides the authoritative list of signatories for verification. [House Cleark](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/202509020)}
