# Legislative Actions and Campaign Positions on Education

### Summary

> * In 2024, Andy Ogles introduced legislation targeting student protesters, including the "Antisemitism Community Service Act" that would require those convicted of unlawful campus activities since October 7, 2023, to complete at least six months of community service in Gaza ([Knoxville News-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C10-S181-JB1V-G31F-00000-00&context=1519360); [Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C10-S181-JB1V-G24V-00000-00&context=1519360); [Jackson Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C16-R8S1-DXGX-61PX-00000-00&context=1519360)).

> * Ogles emphasized the need for a unified approach to reopening plans and opposed extended school closures and ongoing executive orders over COVID-19, arguing it was politicized and not supported by data ([Daily Herald, 7/13/20](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60BV-63N1-JBCN-40R2-00000-00&context=1519360); [Daily Herald, 9/8/20](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60T3-14N1-DXVP-V2R6-00000-00&context=1519360)).

> * Potential vulnerability: Ogles' legislative focus on punishing student demonstrators, as well as the controversial provision to require convicted protesters to serve community service in Gaza, could invite legal scrutiny and public debate about constitutional rights and the efficacy of such measures.
