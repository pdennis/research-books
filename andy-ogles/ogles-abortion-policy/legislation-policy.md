# Legislative Actions and Policy Positions

### Summary

> * Andy Ogles has consistently expressed a strong anti-abortion stance, stating he believes life begins at conception and that “we are duty-bound to protect it at every stage until natural death,” as noted on his campaign website ([Chattanooga Times Free Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBG-MCN1-JBP6-R18G-00000-00&context=1519360), [Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66P3-4KY1-DXVP-V06W-00000-00&context=1519360), [Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66P3-8V51-JB1V-G38G-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * He has repeatedly stated that abortion law should be determined at the state level, commending the Supreme Court decision returning authority over abortion to the states and refusing to say he would support a national ban ([WKRN Interview](https://www.wkrn.com/news/local-news/andy-ogles-talks-abortion-jan-6-economy-in-1-on-1-interview/), [Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66R5-4KS1-JB1V-G4YC-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Ogles has opposed exceptions for rape and incest, calling them “statistically...not even part of the conversation” and has said decisions on exceptions should be left to state legislatures ([WKRN Interview](https://www.wkrn.com/news/local-news/andy-ogles-talks-abortion-jan-6-economy-in-1-on-1-interview/), [Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66P3-4KY1-DXVP-V06W-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * In September 2023, Ogles introduced the federal “Ending Chemical Abortion Act” and called for a nationwide ban on abortion pills, criticizing the Biden administration and the FDA’s policies on drug-induced abortion as dangerous ([Knoxville News-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6997-8RW1-JB1V-G17M-00000-00&context=1519360), [Commercial Appeal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:699K-7WC1-JB1V-G21T-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Ogles has consistently used anti-abortion rhetoric in campaign debates and media, and publicly supported impeaching President Biden, frequently linking abortion policy to criticism of the Biden administration ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66P3-8V51-JB1V-G38G-00000-00&context=1519360), [Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66P3-4KY1-DXVP-V06W-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Potential vulnerability: Ogles’ stance of supporting state-level decision-making on abortion (and initially sidestepping questions about a national ban) may contrast with his subsequent sponsorship of federal abortion pill ban legislation, opening him to criticism of inconsistency ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66R5-4KS1-JB1V-G4YC-00000-00&context=1519360), [Knoxville News-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6997-8RW1-JB1V-G17M-00000-00&context=1519360)).
