> * He has threatened to withhold signing the county budget unless library policies are changed to prevent displays or materials he views as "woke indoctrination," which some see as political interference in educational content ([The Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:672Y-YHS1-DXGX-634M-00000-00&context=1519360); [Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:661F-VM21-JB1V-G31N-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles' strong opposition to "woke" books and displays potentially alienates supporters of intellectual freedom, inclusive education, and library autonomy ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6765-H7T1-DXGX-613Y-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Major media coverage and public debate surrounding his actions have amplified criticism, potentially framing him as intolerant or hostile to diversity in educational settings ([The Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6735-XPJ1-DXGX-62VH-00000-00&context=1519360)).
