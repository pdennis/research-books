# Relationships with Government Agencies and Legal Entities

### Summary

> * Ogles publicly condemned Department of Justice actions, including the FBI's Mar-a-Lago raid, using strong language about partisan overreach and "banana republic" tactics, which may raise concerns about his relationships with key federal law enforcement agencies ([Chattanooga Times Free Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66J5-NM81-DY58-F2HF-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * He was uniquely targeted among Tennessee congressional members, with property seized by law enforcement—an unusual situation suggesting heightened legal or investigative scrutiny ([Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CPD-3FM1-JB1V-G074-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * His campaign's longstanding use of treasurer Thomas Datwyler—whose name appears across multiple FEC filings—could heighten exposure to campaign finance oversight or investigation ([Daily News Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C16-R8S1-DXGX-62CC-00000-00&context=1519360), [Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C16-R8S1-DXGX-60SM-00000-00&context=1519360)).

> * Reliance on the same legal counsel (G. Kline Preston) as other politicians previously embroiled in campaign finance allegations may invite further scrutiny of his campaign’s legal practices ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6997-8RV1-JB1V-G4BN-00000-00&context=1519360)).
