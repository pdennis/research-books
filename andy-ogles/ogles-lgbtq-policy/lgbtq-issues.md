**August 2021: Ogles Contrasted Tennessee's Social Policies With Florida's** According to Tennessee Star, "For his first example, Ogles said that when it comes to having men in women’s dressing rooms and restrooms, ‘Florida figured it out.’ Meanwhile, the purported business-friendly state of Tennessee’s half measure was to shift the liability to businesses, by requiring them to post their policy at their restrooms."

**2022: Ogles Supported Overturning Same-Sex Marriage Ruling** According to Chattanooga Times Free Press, "in a recent speech said he wants the U.S. Supreme Court to do the same thing with same-sex marriage as it did with Roe v. Wade and abortion rights, stand 'firm' on the 10th Amendment and turn the decision over to the states so Tennessee can outlaw gay marriage. [...] 'Next thing we need to do is go after gay marriage. We need to revert that back to the states so each and every state can decide their destiny,' he said."
