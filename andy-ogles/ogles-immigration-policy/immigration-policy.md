# Immigration Legislation and Policy Proposals

### Summary

> * U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Columbia) announced in July 2024 that he will introduce legislation to impose the death penalty on undocumented immigrants who are found guilty of assaulting, raping, or killing American citizens, aiming to increase the consequences for such crimes ([Knoxville News-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CGD-XDB1-JB1V-G1DG-00000-00&context=1519360), [Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CGD-XDB1-JB1V-G31P-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * The proposed legislation would be titled the "Protecting Women and Children Act" and was publicly discussed by Ogles on his Rumble podcast, where he emphasized prioritizing U.S. citizens over undocumented individuals ([Daily News Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CGV-VMT1-JB1V-G3GR-00000-00&context=1519360), [Oak Ridger](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CGV-VMT1-JB1V-G36R-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Ogles justified the bill as a deterrent, stating it would send a clear message to undocumented immigrants that violent crimes targeting U.S. citizens would carry the highest penalty ([Jackson Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CGM-WG31-JB1V-G1G2-00000-00&context=1519360), [Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CGM-WG31-JB1V-G0H8-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Ogles echoed claims—previously made by former President Donald Trump—that some South and Central American countries are intentionally releasing prisoners and sending criminals to the U.S., a statement not independently substantiated in the articles ([Knoxville News-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CGD-XDB1-JB1V-G1DG-00000-00&context=1519360), [Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CGD-XCT1-DXGX-64N6-00000-00&context=1519360), [Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CGD-XDB1-JB1V-G31P-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Potential vulnerability: The policy proposal raises legal and human rights questions concerning due process, proportionality of punishment, and the targeting of a specific population based on immigration status.
