**February 2020: Andy Ogles Urged Caution On County Refugee Policy Decision** According to Daily Roll Call, "Maury County Mayor Andy Ogles, showing fear of disagreeing with the king, said: 'It may be appropriate to wait at least one month to see what the legislature would do,' Ogles said. 'We have to do the right thing for the right reasons for the people of this county. That being said, we do have a governor whose help we are going to need if we do want a new agriculture center. I don’t want to unnecessarily slap him in the face when the legislature is going to take action and basically nip this in the bud.'"
