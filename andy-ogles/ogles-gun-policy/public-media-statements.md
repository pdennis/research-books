### Responses to Mass Shootings

**2024: Ogles Criticized For Response To Covenant School Shooting, Including Christmas Card With AR-15s** According to Nashville Post, "Benton also laments a lack of 'sanity' in Washington and an unwillingness to 'bend the knee' to Trump as contributing to his decision. Adds Benton about the Covenant shooting: 'Here's this guy with a Christmas card showing his family all holding AR-15s. Like, really? That's the Congressman that we have? … He's just completely ignored that whole issue and those families.'"
