# Support for Second Amendment Rights

### Summary

> * In February 2020, Andy Ogles signed a resolution declaring Maury County a “Second Amendment Sanctuary,” affirming the constitutional right to bear arms and protecting law-abiding citizens from what it described as unconstitutional gun laws ([Columbia Daily Herald](https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/story/news/politics/county/2020/03/01/ogles-signs-resolution-protecting-2nd-amendment/112334856/)).
> * The resolution explicitly emphasized it was designed to shield law-abiding citizens’ rights and not intended to make the county a safe haven for criminals ([Columbia Daily Herald](https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/story/news/politics/county/2020/03/01/ogles-signs-resolution-protecting-2nd-amendment/112334856/)).
> * Ogles publicly aligned the county’s stance with Governor Lee’s permitless carry proposal, citing the timing of the resolution as supportive of statewide efforts to protect gun rights ([Columbia Daily Herald](https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/story/news/politics/county/2020/03/01/ogles-signs-resolution-protecting-2nd-amendment/112334856/)).
> * He expressed strong opposition to gun control measures gaining traction in other states, advocating for Tennessee to prioritize gun rights and supporting local legislators who back Second Amendment protections ([Columbia Daily Herald](https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/story/news/politics/county/2020/03/01/ogles-signs-resolution-protecting-2nd-amendment/112334856/)).
> * Ogles encouraged responsible firearm ownership, emphasizing the importance of proper training and crediting his constitutional beliefs as his motivation for signing the resolution ([Columbia Daily Herald](https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/story/news/politics/county/2020/03/01/ogles-signs-resolution-protecting-2nd-amendment/112334856/)).
> * There is potential vulnerability to criticism that sanctuary declarations could complicate law enforcement efforts or be seen as politically motivated, though Ogles and the resolution’s text insist the policy aims only to uphold lawful citizens’ rights.
