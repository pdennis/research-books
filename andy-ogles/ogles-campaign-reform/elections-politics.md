# Elections and Political Process

### Summary

> * Ogles repeatedly advocated for the exclusive use of paper ballots, aligning with election security skeptics and potentially alienating voters who trust current voting systems ([Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65TB-GVM1-DXVP-V4NM-00000-00&context=1519360), [Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:664B-4T91-JB1V-G1J8-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * He has publicly claimed there was fraud in the 2020 election, but avoided clearly stating whether he believes Biden was elected fairly, raising concerns about undermining election legitimacy ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66R5-4KS1-JB1V-G4YC-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles's statements echo unsubstantiated claims of widespread election irregularities, which could deter moderate or independent voters who are wary of conspiracy theories ([Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6706-B9D1-JB1V-G355-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * The focus on election fraud and ballot security may suggest a lack of attention to broader policy issues, exposing Ogles to criticism for not addressing constituents' everyday concerns.
> * His repeated emphasis on paper ballot reforms rests on a platform that may be perceived as out of step with mainstream bipartisan support for current election processes.
