# Relevant Legislation and Public Statements on Foreign Affairs

### Summary

> * Ogles co-sponsored legislation in 2025 to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America," aligning with priorities reportedly tied to backing former President Trump’s agenda ([Oak Ridger](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F0F-B393-SJ5R-H0BR-00000-00&context=1519360), [Jackson Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F0F-B393-SJ5R-H0YC-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * He introduced a separate bill authorizing the president to negotiate with Denmark for U.S. acquisition of Greenland as a territory ([Oak Ridger](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F0F-B393-SJ5R-H0BR-00000-00&context=1519360), [Jackson Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F0F-B393-SJ5R-H0YC-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * These actions establish foreign policy initiatives bound to high-visibility, controversial proposals rather than traditional diplomatic efforts.
> * The legislative focus reflects a clear intention to publicly support Trump's political direction in foreign affairs.
> * Both bills are likely to generate significant domestic and international debate, particularly concerning diplomatic relations with Mexico, Denmark, and allies.
> * There is potential vulnerability in pursuing such high-profile, symbolic foreign affairs moves, as they may draw criticism regarding their seriousness, feasibility, and impact on international partnerships.
