# Positions on Key Foreign Policy Issues

### Summary

> * Ogles faced widespread criticism for comments perceived as advocating violence toward Palestinians and expressing “kill them all” sentiments in response to Gaza activism, leading to multiple editorials and news outlets labeling his remarks as cold and callous ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BDC-62N1-DXGX-62Y0-00000-00&context=1519360), [Knoxville News-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BDK-5HB1-JB1V-G0T2-00000-00&context=1519360), [Jackson Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BDK-5HB1-JB1V-G2BF-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * His introduction of punitive legislation targeting campus demonstrators—including a bill mandating community service in Gaza and revoking visas—could be framed as extreme and potentially violating civil liberties ([Daily News Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C16-R8S1-DXGX-62CC-00000-00&context=1519360), [Commercial Appeal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C1D-P7F1-JB1V-G2HG-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles consistently opposed further U.S. aid to Ukraine and criticized prioritizing Ukraine over domestic issues, but notably refused to comment on Russian annexation of Ukrainian territories despite repeated media requests ([Tennessean](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6997-8RV1-JB1V-G4BN-00000-00&context=1519360), [Knoxville News-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6997-8RW1-JB1V-G17M-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * His public focus on China as America’s top threat may be seen as lacking nuance or as using fear-based rhetoric, especially when contrasted with perceived openness by other Tennessee leaders to working with China ([Tennessee Star](https://tennesseestar.com/news/maury-county-mayor-andy-ogles-conservative-tennessee-is-a-state-of-half-measures/klbaigert/2021/08/02/), [Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68YM-2C51-DXGX-61M6-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Ogles’ push for acquisition of Greenland and support for Trump-era proposals can be used by opponents to paint him as unserious or focused on fringe priorities rather than mainstream foreign policy issues ([Oak Ridger](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F0F-B393-SJ5R-H0BR-00000-00&context=1519360), [Columbia Daily Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FBN-SC33-RSN1-S4K1-00000-00&context=1519360)).
