In May 2025, the House passed H.R. 1—the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”—by just one vote, and Rep. Andy Ogles’s “Yea” was decisive. The bill created a nationwide work-requirement policy for Medicaid, forcing most low-income to file new burdensome paperwork, or lose coverage. The Congressional Budget Office and multiple health-policy experts estimated that this change would cause about 5 million people to lose Medicaid coverage by 2034, with most becoming uninsured. Ogles later voted “Aye” again when the House approved the Senate’s final version, sending it to the president, who signed it into law on July 4, 2025.

### The House passed H.R. 1 by a single vote, and Andy Ogles voted “Yea,” making his vote decisive
- On May 22, 2025, the House passed H.R. 1 (the One Big Beautiful Bill Act) by 215–214, with one member voting present (Roll Call 145). ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119th-congress/1st-session?utm_source=openai))  
- The official roll-call list for Roll Call 145 shows “Ogles, Andrew [R‑TN] — Yea.” ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/index.php/votes/house/119-1/145))  
- In one‑vote margin outcomes, any one “yea” on the winning side is a “deciding vote” because flipping that single vote would change the result. ([politifact.com](https://www.politifact.com/article/2010/oct/26/what-makes-vote-deciding-vote/?utm_source=openai))

### The bill Ogles helped pass included federal Medicaid work requirements designed in ways CBO and experts say would cause millions to lose coverage
- H.R. 1’s enacted text includes a nationwide Medicaid “work/community engagement” requirement for ACA‑expansion adults (generally ages 19–64), requiring at least 80 hours per month of work, service, approved programs, or equivalent income, with proof of compliance before applying and at redeterminations, effective no later than December 31, 2026 (state earlier optional). ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/summary/55?utm_source=openai))  
- KFF summarizes CBO’s estimate of the House‑passed package: 18.5 million adults would be subject to the requirement each year; by 2034 federal Medicaid coverage would decrease by about 5.2 million adults, increasing the number of uninsured by about 4.8 million. ([kff.org](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/a-closer-look-at-the-work-requirement-provisions-in-the-2025-federal-budget-reconciliation-law/?utm_source=openai))  
- FactCheck.org likewise reports CBO’s estimate that the Medicaid work requirement would reduce enrollment by 5.2 million people in 2034 and increase the uninsured by 4.8 million. ([factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2025/06/assessing-medicaid-coverage-losses-under-house-reconciliation-bill/?utm_source=openai))  
- Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families explains that the House bill’s Medicaid work‑reporting rules would by themselves lead to 5.2 million fewer people enrolled in 2034 and that people losing Medicaid for not meeting the reporting requirement are barred from ACA premium tax credits, pushing many into uninsurance. ([ccf.georgetown.edu](https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2025/05/27/medicaid-and-chip-cuts-in-the-house-passed-reconciliation-bill-explained/?utm_source=openai))  
- The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities provides state and congressional‑district estimates, concluding the legislation’s Medicaid work requirements would take coverage away from millions (roughly 9.9–14.9 million people at risk in 2034 under the final package). ([cbpp.org](https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/senate-bill-expands-medicaid-work-requirements-to-include-some-parents-would-take?utm_source=openai))  
- AP reporting on the package similarly highlights CBO findings that millions could lose coverage, including 5.2 million due to the work requirement alone. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/e2f61c37d6cc7b6d96e85a679944476a?utm_source=openai))  
- Commonwealth Fund analysis notes CBO’s assumption that about 92% of those losing Medicaid under these provisions would become uninsured, underscoring the scale of coverage loss.

### The measure went on to become law, and Ogles again voted “Aye” on the final House vote to send it to the President
- H.R. 1 subsequently passed the Senate 51–50 on July 1, 2025 (with the Vice President breaking the tie), and became Public Law 119‑21 on July 4, 2025. ([senate.gov](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1191/vote_119_1_00372.htm?utm_source=openai))  
- On July 3, 2025, the House agreed to the Senate amendment by 218–214 (Roll Call 190); the roll‑call list shows “Ogles, Andrew [R‑TN] — Aye.” ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/index.php/votes/house/119-1/190?utm_source=openai))

### Therefore, Ogles’s “Yea” on a one‑vote House passage was a necessary vote for advancing a bill projected to remove Medicaid coverage from millions
- Because the May 22, 2025 House passage succeeded by one vote and Ogles voted “Yea,” his vote was necessary for passage of a bill whose Medicaid work‑requirement provisions CBO and health‑policy experts project would cause millions to lose coverage.
