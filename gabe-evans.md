# How To Win Against Gabe Evans

[Perpetual](https://coloradonewsline.com/2025/07/22/u-s-rep-gabe-evans-misrepresented-familys-immigration-history/) [liar](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2025/07/food-bank-warned-gabe-evans-need-will-get-worse-if-trumps-budget-bill-passed/71805/) Gabe Evans ran on [public safety and making life more affordable](https://electgabeevans.com/), then voted to cut services and raise costs on Coloradans. He voted to kick more than 29,000 Coloradans off their health insurance, for massive cuts to Medicare, and to make it harder for his neighbors to buy food. He cast the deciding vote to protect Trump’s tariffs, which were hurting small businesses and could result in higher food and housing costs for Coloradans. For all of his talk about cracking down on criminals, he cast the deciding vote to protect accused pedophiles named in the Epstein files. Then he stood by while Trump laid off Coloradans and gutted the Social Security agency.

### **EVANS VOTED FOR DEVASTATING HEALTH CARE CUTS** 

-   Evans voted for a bill that is estimated to kick [17 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including [nearly 12 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) who rely on Medicaid. An estimated [29,000 Coloradans](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) could lose their health insurance as a result of Evans’ vote.
-   Evans has [previously said](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2024/10/evans-doubles-down-on-obamacare-repeal-we-need-to-go-back-to-the-drawing-board/65519/) [“we need to go back to the drawing board”](https://www.denver7.com/news/politics/republican-gabe-evans-hopes-to-unseat-democratic-incumbent-in-colorados-8th-congressional-district) when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, which enabled Medicaid expansion that covers more Coloradans. More than [282,000 Coloradans](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/marketplace-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) were enrolled in Affordable Care Act Marketplace health insurance plans.

**Message:** Evans voted to rip away health care from thousands of Coloradans to fund billionaire tax cuts. 

### **EVANS VOTED FOR MASSIVE CUTS TO MEDICARE**

-   Evans [_voted_](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml) for a bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would trigger [nearly _$500 billion_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare absent future congressional action.

**Message:** Evans voted to make massive cuts to health care services seniors rely on all to give billionaires tax breaks. 

### **EVANS WAS THE DECIDING VOTE TO PROTECT TRUMP’S TARIFFS**

-   Evans has voted four times to protect Trump’s tariffs, including in April when he was the [deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect the tariffs from being repealed by Congress, dooming Coloradans who relied on him to a trade war and rising prices. Tariffs are contributing to [higher food prices](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi) and are hurting Colorado [small businesses](https://www.usnews.com/news/u-s-news-decision-points/articles/2025-08-21/how-tariffs-are-affecting-this-colorado-small-business-owner) and [construction companies](https://www.vaildaily.com/news/trump-tariffs-colorado-construction-materials/), which could [worsen housing affordability](https://coloradonewsline.com/2025/09/04/colorado-tariff-rate-rises-sevenfold/).
-   Despite this, Evans has claimed that Trump’s tariffs will [“bring down the price of goods for all Americans.”](https://www.cpr.org/2025/04/03/what-colorado-lawmakers-think-of-trumps-tariffs/)

**Message:** Evans was the deciding vote to crush Colorado small businesses and ensure Coloradans will pay more for groceries and housing. 

### Evans’ Votes Threatened Clean Energy Jobs In His District

-   Evans [signed](https://garbarino.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/garbarino.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025.03.09-tax-credits-letter.pdf) [letters](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/13-house-republicans-urge-senate-scale-back-clean-energy-cuts-bill-vot-rcna211516) urging Republican leaders not to repeal Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax credits, then [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) to [repeal](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-passes-senate-megabill-trump-ira-tax-credit/752276/) those same credits and make them harder to access, threatening clean energy jobs in Colorado. Then, Evans [defended](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/sep/29/meet-americas-energy-demand-innovation-alone-isnt-enough/) his vote to cut the credits, claiming the Republican budget bill was a sensible approach to clean energy tax credits. Since the beginning of the Trump administration, clean energy projects that were projected to create hundreds of jobs in Evans’ district have been [cancelled](https://coloradosun.com/2025/06/25/colorado-clean-energy-project-cancellations/) or [stalled](https://www.denverpost.com/2025/07/13/colorado-renewable-energy-projects-trump-bill/).

**Message:** Evans voted to kill job opportunities for Coloradans to give tax cuts to billionaires. 

### **THE EVANS LIE FACTORY: CAST VOTES THAT HURT A LOCAL FOOD BANK, THEN LIE ABOUT IT**

-   In March 2025, Evans voted for House Republicans’ continuing resolution, which rescinded all community project funding requests, including one that was meant to [help the Weld Food Bank](https://www.cpr.org/2025/03/18/congressional-earmarks/). That coupled with grant cuts made by the Trump administration meant the food bank was not able to buy refrigerated trucks or a forklift as a result and had to [cancel orders](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2025/06/devastating-impact-evans-meets-with-food-bank-staff-still-supports-budget-bill-which-could-overwhelm-them/70968/) for 120,000 pounds of protein and dairy items that it was going to buy from Colorado farmers.
-   Next, Evans [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that made the [largest cut to SNAP in history](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-senate-republican-leaderships-reconciliation-bill-takes). Then, [he lied](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2025/07/food-bank-warned-gabe-evans-need-will-get-worse-if-trumps-budget-bill-passed/71805/) and claimed the food bank supported the cuts when they told him the cuts would only make their lines longer and hurt Coloradans. [More than 29,000](https://www.fns.usda.gov/data-research/data-visualization/snap-community-characteristics-congressional-district-dashboard) Coloradans’ in Evans’ district rely on SNAP to afford groceries.

**Message:** Evans voted to make food more expensive for Coloradans and lied about how his votes will hurt his neighbors.  

### **EVANS STOOD BY WHILE TRUMP ATTACKED SOCIAL SECURITY AND FIRED HARD-WORKING COLORADANS**

-   Evans [_defended_](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/gabe-evans-the-real-story-wriley-lewis-53025/s-s5rOqqhVHgr?si=1a4b2df971ff45a987604a3b325c1a76&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” as DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [_affecting_](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [_federal government’s_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) [_ability_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/) to [_deliver services_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. More than [_103,000 Coloradans_](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/co.pdf) in Evans’ district relied on Social Security benefits.
-   Evans defended DOGE even though it had resulted in nearly [_$16 million in cuts_](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2025/06/doge-has-cut-nearly-16-million-from-gabe-evans-district-he-calls-it-right-sizing-government/70849/) to his district, including to school lunches, electric vehicle infrastructure, and public safety funding. He stood by while [_hard-working_](https://www.denverpost.com/2025/02/27/noaa-national-weather-service-layoffs-colorado/) [_Coloradans_](https://www.cpr.org/2025/02/28/colorado-federal-employees-unemployment-filings/) [_lost their jobs_](https://kdvr.com/news/local/colorado-advocates-say-impacts-of-national-park-service-layoffs-will-be-visceral/).

**Message:** While Social Security lines grew and Colorado workers were laid off, Evans didn’t help them. 

### It Took Evans 11 Months To Vote To Release The Epstein Files And He Did Only After Trump Gave Republicans Permission

- 	In November 2025, after 11 months, Evans finally [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml) to release the Epstein files, but only after [Donald Trump gave House Republicans permission](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115562626931599548) to do so. Previoulsy, Evans had [cast the deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml) against [releasing the Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj), protecting the accused pedophiles named within. Evans never [signed](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209) the discharge petition that called for the files' release and he never [co-sponsored](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581/cosponsors?pageSort=alphaByParty) Rep. Thomas Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna's resolution that called for their release.   

**Message:** Evans can't be trusted to hold accused pedophiles named in the Epstein files accountable, he'll fall in line with whatever Trump wants him to do.

### **Colorado Hospitals At Risk**
