<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Zinke has already voted against Montana during the 119<sup>th</sup> congress. With his vote in support of House Republicans’ continuing resolution, he also voted to cut all promised 2025 community project funding. That included infrastructure funding he had promised to places like Seeley Lake and Ravalli for sewer and water projects that would help with building housing.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Zinke’s Vote For House Republicans’ Continuing Resolution Caused The Delay Of Water And Infrastructure Projects In Montana That Were Counting On Federal Funding He Promised</strong></h2>
<p><strong>3/11/25: Zinke Voted In Favor Of A Bill To Fund The Government Through September 2025 And Avoid A Shutdown. </strong>According to the New York Times, "The House voted 217 to 213 on a bill to fund the federal government through September and avoid a shutdown that would have started this weekend. All but one Republican voted ‘yes,’ joined by just one Democrat. The legislation will now move to the Senate. Some conservative House Republicans who tend to vote against similar stop-gap spending legislation said they were inclined to support this bill because it would provide flexibility for Mr. Trump to dismantle major portions of the government through Elon Musk’s cost-cutting operation, the Department of Government Efficiency. Democratic leaders encouraged their members to oppose the bill for similar reasons."

<p><strong>Infrastructure Projects In Montana That Were Expecting Federal Funding Promised By Zinke Were Temporarily Sidelined Or Delayed Because The Budget The House Passed Did Not Include Them.</strong> According to the Missoulian, "Money for several western Montana infrastructure projects worth more than $21 million combined was placed on hold earlier this month after Congress passed a temporary budget void of the projects. Rep. Ryan Zinke, however, said he still plans to secure the funding in the future. The congressman proposed several requests that use federal dollars to help fund much-needed sewer systems in Seeley Lake and Ravalli County, road improvements in the Flathead Valley, a new library in Troy, among a host of other projects. The loss of funding has temporarily sidelined or delayed most of the projects, which rely heavily on the federal grants."

  <li><strong>Zinke Had Promised Seeley Lake $10 Million In Federal Funding For Its Sewer Project, Which Was Needed To Improve Water Quality And Build Additional Housing. </strong>According to the Missoulian, "Design work and planning for the Seeley Lake Sewer Project are still in progress, but the loss of a large federal earmark means the project will likely be set back one year, according to one of the local sewer district board members.&nbsp; The sewer project has been a multi-year effort stemming from increased water contamination from individual septic tanks and a need to build additional housing for residents. Housing has been a longtime struggle for the town of 1,500. […] Zinke proposed an initial $10 million of federal dollars to support the sewer project during a site visit last October — his largest overall earmark. Zinke then said he would propose an additional $10 million the following year to complete the project. The money could be used in several ways, according to sewer board member Tom Morris, but a main priority would be to purchase land for the system."

  <li><strong>Zinke Had Promised Ravalli $5 Million In Federal Funding For A New Wastewater Treatment Facility. </strong>According to the Missoulian, "In the absence of the proposed $5 million in funding for the new Ravalli County wastewater treatment facility, Ravalli County commissioners said they are ‘playing it by ear’ in terms of how they will move forward with discussion surrounding the project.&nbsp; ‘It hasn’t had any impact yet,’ said county commissioner Dan Huls. ‘We’re playing it by ear at the moment and trying to react as best we can.’&nbsp; Zinke said in a May 2024 press release that the Ravalli County wastewater treatment project would ‘protect drinking water, ease capacity restrictions inhibiting development, and protect environmental quality by keeping septage seepage and human waste out of critical groundwater siphons and the Bitterroot River.’" [The Missoulian, <a href="https://missoulian.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/article_e90042ab-fd69-4b02-a5f3-dc1f907201cd.html"><u>3/20/25</u></a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Zinke Had Promised $2 Million In Federal Funding To Replace A Bridge In Victor And Repair Roads In Hamilton.</strong> According to the Missoulian, "In addition to funding for a new Ravalli County wastewater treatment plant, $2 million in funding for a bridge replacement project on Groff Lane in Victor and road repairs on Old Corvallis Road in Hamilton were both delayed. Zinke said in a press release that the $1 million renovation of Old Corvallis Road was ‘crucial to ensuring safe and efficient travel along Old Corvallis Road.’ ‘Old Corvallis Road serves as a crucial transportation artery in the greater Hamilton area, connecting the Corvallis community with essential services and employment opportunities in the City of Hamilton, notably a large pharmaceutical facility as well as a soon-to-be residential development that will consist of 140 units,’ reads the statement."

  <li><strong>Zinke Had Promised Federal Funding To Help Troy Repair The Runway At Its Local And Emergency Airport. </strong>According to the Missoulian, "A local and emergency airport in Troy had been earmarked with funds to repair its runway later in 2025, as its county government is responsible for the upkeep of the land, but has no available money to make the $820,000 fix, according to one of its county commissioners.&nbsp; Troy is a city in Lincoln County with a population of 797, according to the 2020 U.S. Census. It is not a commercial airport, but a rural operation that supports local firefighting efforts in the summer and is a landing pad for medical emergency helicopters."

  <li><strong>Zinke Had Promised Federal Funding To Help Repair Guardrails On The North Fork Road, Which Was A Main Connector For Tourists Traveling To Parts Of Glacier National Park, Residential Access, And Timber Industry Operations. </strong>According to the Missoulian, "North Fork Road is a main connector for tourists traveling to sections of Glacier National Park, residential access and timber industry operations. Zinke proposed funding guardrail repairs in parts of the roadway with steep dropoffs.&nbsp; ‘Despite its significance, the North Fork Road poses safety concerns,’ Zinke’s office said in its application. ‘Composed of mostly gravel surface and winding in nature, it has numerous roadside hazards, including sections of the roadway with steep side slopes descending to the river below.’&nbsp; Zinke’s staff said existing guardrails along the road have surpassed their lifespan and are in poor condition. Zinke’s office proposed replacing or adding more than three miles of guardrails on the road. It is unclear how the delay in funding might affect the project. A call to the Flathead County Commissioners was not returned by press time."
