## Overview

Zinke said he [liked](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5152748-trump-administration-national-parks/) what Trump’s DOGE was doing as DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) [ability](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/) to [deliver services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. More than [133,839 Montanans](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/mt.pdf) in Zinke’s district relied on Social Security benefits. Zinke has stood by while Social Security was threatened before. When he was first elected to congress he [dismissed](https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2015/apr/02/zinke-attracts-crowd-at-town-hall-meeting-6/) concerns about Republican proposals to cut Social Security and Medicare. 

Zinke said he liked DOGE even though it resulted in the mass layoffs of [Montana workers](https://montanafreepress.org/2025/04/01/yellowstones-gateway-town-fears-for-its-future-amid-trump-funding-cuts/) that threatened [rural economies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/05/01/hamilton-montana-federal-government-job-cuts/). 

## Zinke Said He Liked What DOGE Was Doing

### Zinke: “I Like What DOGE Is Doing”

**Zinke: “I Think Everything Is On The Table, I Like What DOGE Is Doing. Let’s Shake It Up Because Business As Usual Is Not Working In The Great Outdoors.”** According to an interview Ryan Zinke gave on News Nation, “ZINKE: I think everything is on the table, I like what DOGE is doing. Let’s shake it up because business as usual is not working in the great outdoors. We’re burning our forests up. We're not using our resources wisely. And I think everyone can say there's a lot of room for improvement. But first, let’s get rid of the fraud, waste and abuse.” \[News Nation: The Hill, 2/18/25; The Hill, [2/19/25](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5152748-trump-administration-national-parks/)\] (video) 

**Zinke Acknowledged The Federal Cuts Led By DOGE Were Chaotic But Claimed Things Were Mostly Smoothed Out.** According to the Daily Inter Lake, "Republican Congressman Ryan Zinke defended efforts by the Trump administration to downsize and remake the federal government while taking questions from Glacier High School students on Thursday.  The students met with the congressman at the front entrance of the high school in Kalispell on March 13 to celebrate the appointment of a classmate to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. They took the opportunity to pepper Zinke with questions about federal workforce reductions and the future of education funding. Asked about the slew of layoffs of federal workers, some of which have since been reversed by the courts, Zinke acknowledged bumps in the process. \[…\] ‘There were some mistakes that were made but mostly it's been smoothed out,’ he said. ‘... Sometimes, you know, shutting down like jobs, anyone on probation ... well sometimes that may not have the same effect as you want.’" \[Daily Inter Lake, [3/15/25](https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2025/mar/15/zinke-talks-trump-layoffs-and-education-to-students-at-glacier/)\]

In the field, office managers have resorted to answering phones in place of receptionists because so many employees have been pushed out. Amid all this, the agency no longer has a system to monitor customer experience because that office was eliminated as part of the cost-cutting efforts led by Elon Musk. And the phones keep ringing.

### When He Was First Elected To Congress Zinke Dismissed Concerns About Republican Proposals To Cut Social Security And Medicare

**Confronted With Concerns About Republican Budget Proposals To Cut Medicare And Social Security, Zinke Responded That Cutting All Defense Spending, Taxing The Richest One Percent, And Other Proposals Would Not Fix The National Debt.** According to the Daily Inter Lake, "While most of Zinke’s responses drew support from the crowd, one man told the congressman that he was alarmed by Republican budget proposals to cut Medicare and Social Security funding and partially privatize the programs.  ‘I don’t want to be at the mercy of a for-profit system of health-care providers and insurers,’ he said. ‘I’m alarmed at the prospect of turning over \[Social Security\] money into the hands of corrupt Wall Street bankers who tried to destroy our system eight years ago. ... You have to expect the wealthy to do their part by accepting higher taxes, which they can well afford.’  Zinke responded that cutting all defense spending, taxing the richest 1 percent and other Democratic proposals would not provide a fix to the country’s growing debt. ‘Take all their cash. In fact, take all your cash. Take all the cash in the entire world and it’s doesn’t add up to $18 trillion,’ Zinke said, referring to U.S. debt." \[Daily Inter Lake, [4/2/15](https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2015/apr/02/zinke-attracts-crowd-at-town-hall-meeting-6/)\]
