# **How To Win Against Jen Kiggans**

Jen Kiggans is the biggest threat to her constituents well-being and quality of life. As a state senator and now as a Congresswoman, Kiggans has shown that she’s a far-right conservative who would rather run away from Virginians than fight for them. She voted to kick Virginians off of their health coverage by supporting the Big Ugly Bill, breaking her numerous earlier promises to protect those very benefits. She then called the bill a “win” for her district, despite the fact that a major hospital in it was at-risk of closing due to the bill’s cuts. Kiggans claimed Trump’s tariffs put the country in a good direction before casting the deciding vote to protect them. She told Virginians who lost their job due to DOGE cuts to “go out and get” another job. She even ran away when asked why she refused to protect veterans from predatory payday lenders. That’s a clear pattern: cuts to care, higher costs, fewer services, and excuses instead of results for Virginians.

### Kiggans Voted For Devastating Health Care Cuts

-   Kiggans [_promised_](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/16/mike-johnson-budget-medicaid-house-republicans) that she [_would_](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/mo/st-louis/news/2025/06/24/group-of-16-house-republicans-raise-alarm-that-senate-s-changes-to-medicaid-jeopardizes-their-support-for-trump-s-bill) [_protect Medicaid_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvf6OYK-F1o), but then she [_voted_](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that would kick [_17 million Americans_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including nearly [_12 million Americans_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off of Medicaid. More than [_22,000 Virginians_](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) could lose their health coverage as a result of her votes. The Southampton Memorial Hospital was designated [_at-risk_](https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_on_rural_hospitals.pdf) and three hospitals in Virginia have already announced they are [_closing_](https://www.whsv.com/2025/09/04/augusta-health-consolidate-clinics-partly-response-big-beautiful-bill/?utm_source=Spanberger+for+Governor+Press+List&utm_campaign=ba482e5142-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_09_08_01_40&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_-ba482e5142-506668907) because of Medicaid cuts.

**Message:** Kiggans voted to take health coverage and access from Virginians to give billionaires tax breaks. 

### Kiggans Broke Her Promise And Voted For Massive Medicare Cuts

-   Before getting elected to Congress, Kiggans [promised](https://www.wavy.com/video/kiggans-talks-inflation-border-security-healthcare/10208988/?fbclid=IwY2xjawG6wxxleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHaQLlMz7BEH8s_DViY2bqMFKWh2Vk_RrszCrwGti-svvXcQPV3tSyu9dnQ_aem_kBW3ahNEbkn2bC4uV2u3jA) to protect her constituents’ Medicare benefits. However, when presented the opportunity to stand by her word, Kiggans [broke](https://x.com/JenKiggans/status/1925529303053160768) her promises. In 2025, Kiggans voted for Republicans’ reconciliation bill, which the Congressional Budget Office estimated would trigger nearly [$500 billion](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-05/61423-PAYGO.pdf) in cuts to Medicare, absent future congressional action. 

**Message:** Kiggans voted to cut health care services for seniors all to give billionaires tax breaks. 

### Kiggans Sided With Big Pharma Over Virginia Seniors

-   Kiggans [_opposed_](https://x.com/RepJenKiggans/status/1882448247371042982) [_the_](https://www.c-span.org/video/?523485-1/virginia-2nd-congressional-district-debate) Inflation Reduction Act, which [_lowered prescription drug costs_](https://www.hhs.gov/inflation-reduction-act/index.html) and [_capped the cost of insulin at $35/month_](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-facts-about-the-35-insulin-copay-cap-in-medicare/) for seniors. More than [_193,000 Virginians_](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ira-rx-prices-virginia.pdf) took prescription drugs that had been selected for price negotiation under the law’s provisions.

**Message:** Kiggans sided with big pharma over cheaper prescription drug costs for Virginia seniors. 

### Kiggans Watched While Social Security And Federal Workers Came Under Attack

-   Kiggans claimed what Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” was doing was [“so necessary.”](https://x.com/JenKiggans/status/1894001835645837501) Meanwhile, DOGE [laid off](https://www.axios.com/local/washington-dc/2025/07/22/northern-virginia-federal-job-cuts-impact) thousands of federal workers in Virginia and DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) ability to [deliver services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. Kiggans even [downplayed](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/g56_bGkpWt8) Trump’s layoffs of Virginians. Only in November 2025, after reports that DOGE canceled at least 70 contracts with veteran-owned businesses in her district, did Kiggans [claim](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/22/veteran-owned-businesses-trump-contract-cuts-00664317) to be “actively working to review and reverse” DOGE’s detrimental cuts. More than [158,000 Virginians](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/va.pdf) in Kiggans district relied on Social Security benefits and [more than 30,000](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/thousands-of-workers-in-each-congressional-district-could-lose-their-jobs-to-doge/) were employed by the federal government. 

**Message:** Kiggans thought it was “so necessary” that Virginia workers lost their jobs and seniors waited longer for services. 

### Kiggans Was The Deciding Vote To Protect Trump's Tariffs

-   Kiggans [defended](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/I4pV8J5aTLk) [Trump’s tariffs](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bkmhDQtwk-w) and [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAushBLgMaE) [“the direction of the country is a good one.”](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/m2MUvxgC8kI) Then, she voted four times to protect the tariffs, including in April 2025 when she was the [deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect them, dooming Virginia families who relied on her to a trade war and [rising prices](https://www.pilotonline.com/2025/05/06/trade-war-in-va/). Tariffs are contributing to [higher food prices](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi), could [raise car insurance rates](https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2025/08/11/virginia-car-insurance-rates-tariffs), and [caused layoffs in Virginia](https://vadogwood.com/2025/04/22/trumps-tariffs-blamed-for-volvo-layoffs-in-southwest-virginia/). 

**Message:** Kiggans thought Virginians getting laid off and paying higher prices meant the country was going in a good direction.

### Kiggans Broke Her Promise To Protect Clean Energy jobs

-   Kiggans promised to protect clean energy tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act, [touting](https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/donald-trump-wind-virginia-inflation-reduction-act/article_192f265c-cf9c-11ef-ab00-d7160361a027.html) that they “drive billions of dollars of investment” and were “[actively helping](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/10/house-republican-clean-energy-tax-breaks-00218126) out armed forces, small businesses, and everyday families,” before voting multiple times to gut the exact same credits. After each vote, she [played](https://www.eenews.net/articles/house-oks-megabill-after-major-energy-environment-changes/) down the impact of the cuts while simultaneously [pleading](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/13-house-republicans-urge-senate-scale-back-clean-energy-cuts-bill-vot-rcna211516) with Republican leadership to scale back the cuts that threatened [thousands](https://time.com/7291191/big-beautiful-bill-republicans-biden/) of clean energy jobs across Virginia.
-   This wasn’t her first time threatening clean energy jobs in Virginia, either. During her first term in office, Kiggans [voted](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023199) for the Limit, Save, Grow Act, which sought to reset the clean energy tax code to before passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. At the time, Kiggans said she was “[proud](https://www.c-span.org/video/?527649-3/house-session-part-2)” to support the bill. 

**Message:** Despite promising to protect clean energy tax credits that supported Virginia jobs and businesses, Kiggans bent the knee to Republican leadership and voted to gut them.

### Kiggans Refused To Protect Service Members From Predatory Payday Lenders

-   While serving in the Virginia State Senate in 2020, Kiggans [_voted against_](https://vadogwood.com/2024/05/20/kiggans-voted-2020-against-reforms-for-predatory-payday-lenders/) a bill that sought to crackdown on predatory payday lenders, which were known to target service members.
-   Prior to voting against the bill, Kiggans’ campaign [_accepted_](https://www.wavy.com/news/politics/virginia-politics/truth-tracker-kiggans-refuses-to-explain-senate-bill-421/) $20,000 in campaign donations from GOPAC, which had raised at least $100,000 of its money from payday lenders.
-   When confronted about the vote, Kiggans repeatedly refused to explain herself and quickly [_walked out of the interview_](https://www.wavy.com/news/politics/virginia-politics/truth-tracker-kiggans-refuses-to-explain-senate-bill-421/).

**Message:** Kiggans walked away from Virginia veterans who deserve her time and advocacy. 

### It Took Kiggans 11 Months To Vote To Release The Epstein Files And She Did Only After Trump Gave Republicans Permission

-   In November 2025, after 11 months, Kiggans finally [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml) to release the Epstein files, but only after [Donald Trump gave House Republicans permission](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115562626931599548) to do so. Previously, Kiggans had [cast the deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml) against [releasing the Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj), protecting the accused pedophiles named within them. Kiggans never [signed](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209) the discharge petition that called for their release and she never [co-sponsored](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581/cosponsors?pageSort=alphaByParty) Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna’s resolution calling for their release. 

**Message:** It took Kiggans 11 months to vote to release the Epstein files and she did only after Trump gave Republicans permission.
