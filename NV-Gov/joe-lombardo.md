# How To Win Against Joe Lombardo

Joe Lombardo supported federal legislation that stripped health care from thousands of Nevadans, set up future cuts to Medicare, cut SNAP benefits, and rescinded tax credits meant to support clean energy jobs and projects in Nevada. Lombardo praised Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” saying “Nevadans should be excited” about its impacts. Lombardo also praised Trump’s tariffs, saying Nevadans needed to “feel a little pain” to see long term benefits, ignoring the stock market crashing and increasing food prices they caused. He also lauded Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” even as its cuts affected thousands of Nevada federal workers and those reliant on Social Security. Lombardo opposed protections for reproductive rights, supported extreme abortion bans, and wanted to increase barriers to access reproductive care. Lombardo repeatedly used his power as Clark County Sheriff to increase his own salary amid budget cuts and threaten election integrity in Nevada. 

### Lombardo Supported Devastating Health Care Cuts

-   In 2025, Lombardo [supported](https://x.com/JoeLombardoNV/status/1940894636341653552?s=20) Trump’s [“One Big Beautiful Bill,”](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) which is estimated to kick [17 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including [nearly 12 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) who rely on Medicaid. Under the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” more than [100,000 Nevadans](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) could lose their health insurance, and Nevada community health centers [could be downsized](https://news3lv.com/news/local/very-alarming-114k-nevadans-could-lose-health-insurance-in-president-donald-trump-one-big-beautiful-bill-medicaid-care). 
-   Lombardo said [“Nevadans should be excited about”](https://x.com/JoeLombardoNV/status/1940894636341653552?s=20) the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” despite previously expressing concerns about the [“detrimental”](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-republican-gov-lombardo-speaks-out-against-gops-proposed-medicaid-cuts) cuts to Medicaid it would cause. [67,888 Medicaid recipients](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) in Nevada were expected to lose their coverage by 2034 under the bill. 

**Message:** Lombardo supported ripping away health care from thousands of Nevadans to fund tax cuts for the wealthy, despite previously admitting it would be “detrimental” to the state. 

### Lombardo Supported Massive Cuts To Medicare

-   In 2025, Lombardo [supported](https://x.com/JoeLombardoNV/status/1940894636341653552?s=20) the [Republicans’ reconciliation bill](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would trigger [$500 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare. 
-   Lombardo said [“Nevadans should be excited”](https://x.com/JoeLombardoNV/status/1940894636341653552?s=20) about the passing of the bill, and dismissed concerns about its impacts as [“bickering.”](https://x.com/JoeLombardoNV/status/1940894636341653552?s=20)

**Message:** Lombardo supported massive cuts to health care services Nevada seniors rely on. 

### Lombardo Supported Trump’s Tariffs

-   In 2025, Lombardo [supported](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9OcKVYPPq0) Trump’s tariffs, which doomed Nevadans to a trade war and [rising prices](https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/03/06/trump-tariff-impacts-on-booze-food-travel-no-little-disturbance-in-nv-experts-warn/). Tariffs are contributing to [higher](https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/03/06/trump-tariff-impacts-on-booze-food-travel-no-little-disturbance-in-nv-experts-warn/) food prices and posing risks to Nevada’s [retail and hospitality industries](https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/03/06/trump-tariff-impacts-on-booze-food-travel-no-little-disturbance-in-nv-experts-warn/). 
-   Despite this, Lombardo said Nevadans needed to [“feel a little pain”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9OcKVYPPq0) to see long term benefits of Trump’s tariffs, even as the [U.S. stock market crashed](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/04/nx-s1-5352362/markets-selloff-dow-trump-tariffs) due to Trump’s escalating global trade war.

**Message:** Lombardo supported tariffs that made food more expensive and threatened jobs in Nevada’s top industries. 

### Lombardo Supported Stripping SNAP Benefits From Nevada Families 

-   In 2025, Lombardo [supported](https://x.com/JoeLombardoNV/status/1940894636341653552?s=20) Trump’s [“One Big Beautiful Bill,”](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) which made the [largest cut to SNAP in history](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-senate-republican-leaderships-reconciliation-bill-takes). Lombardo said [“Nevadans should be excited”](https://x.com/JoeLombardoNV/status/1940894636341653552?s=20) about the passing of the bill, and dismissed concerns about its impacts as “bickering” while nearly [160,000 Nevada households](https://www.fns.usda.gov/data-research/data-visualization/snap-community-characteristics-congressional-district-dashboard) relied on SNAP to afford groceries.

**Message:** Lombardo supported making food more expensive for Nevadans.

### Lombardo stood by while trump attacked social security and fired hard-working Nevadans

-   In 2025, Lombardo [praised](https://x.com/Lombardo_Press/status/1894177282358714458) Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” as DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) [ability](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/) to [deliver services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. More than [607,000 Nevadans](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/nv.pdf) relied on Social Security benefits. 
-   In March 2025, Lombardo [attacked](https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/lombardo-calls-fords-lawsuits-against-trump-administration-unfortunate-3341265/) Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford for joining lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions, including DOGE policies. 
-   Lombardo [supported DOGE](https://mynews4.com/news/local/doge-in-nevada-a-closer-look-at-government-efficiency-efforts-in-the-silver-state) even though it resulted in [federal funding cuts](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trumps-anti-dei-push-suspends-20m-grant-for-a-nevada-tribes-water-infrastructure) to Nevada [nonprofits](https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/04/23/doge-cuts-mental-health-funding-for-homeless-children-youth-in-nevada-officials-say/) and [organizations](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-admin-abruptly-ends-nv-mental-health-immunization-grants-19-employees-laid-off). Lombardo said balancing Nevada’s budget would [“require” layoffs and the removal of full-time employees](https://youtu.be/nnXkEm-Qyf4). Lombardo believed that Trump had done a [“good job”](https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/lombardo-calls-fords-lawsuits-against-trump-administration-unfortunate-3341265/) while Trump threatened the livelihoods of [nearly 3,745 federal workers](https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/02/21/depth-of-federal-worker-firings-unknown-in-nevada-but-impact-already-being-felt/) in Nevada.

**Message:** While Social Security lines grew and Nevada workers were laid off, Lombardo did nothing to help them.

### Lombardo Supported Legislation That Threatened Clean Energy Jobs In Nevada And Repealed Existing Climate Plans

-   In 2025, Lombardo [supported](https://x.com/JoeLombardoNV/status/1940894636341653552?s=20) Trump’s [“One Big Beautiful Bill,”](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) which [repealed](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-passes-senate-megabill-trump-ira-tax-credit/752276/) clean energy tax credits and made them harder to access, threatening clean energy jobs in Nevada. Under the bill, more than [8,300 clean energy jobs](https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/07/09/ugly-truths-about-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-and-energy-costs/) were predicted to be cut by 2035, and [63 new and proposed solar projects](https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/07/09/ugly-truths-about-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-and-energy-costs/) were at risk of losing funding. 
-   As governor, Lombardo [repealed Nevada’s climate plan and replaced it with his own](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/lombardo-releases-revised-climate-plan-after-lengthy-delay), which was then criticized for being less of a plan and more of a [“summary of what state lawmakers have already accomplished.”](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/lombardo-releases-revised-climate-plan-after-lengthy-delay) Lombardo also [withdrew Nevada](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24172777-lombard-us-climate-alliance/?responsive=1&title=1) from the U.S. Climate Alliance, saying it conflicted with [“Nevada’s energy policy objectives.”](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24172777-lombard-us-climate-alliance/?responsive=1&title=1)

**Message:** Lombardo supported legislation to kill job opportunities for Nevadans to give tax cuts to billionaires, and repealed plans to mitigate climate change. 

### Lombardo Was An Anti-Abortion Extremist

-   Lombardo was an anti-abortion extremist who supported abortion bans and additional restrictions on reproductive care.
-   Lombardo, who described himself as [“Catholic and pro-life,”](https://x.com/JoeLombardoNV/status/1540408275254091782?s=20) [celebrated Roe v. Wade being overturned](https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/07/28/pro-choice-advocates-fear-dystopian-future-under-lombardo/), and supported a [13-week abortion ban ballot initiative](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/on-the-record-top-candidate-abortion-stances). 
-   Lombardo wanted to further restrict reproductive care with [bans on emergency contraception and mandating waiting periods](https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/07/28/pro-choice-advocates-fear-dystopian-future-under-lombardo/) and [parental notification](https://x.com/JoeLombardoNV/status/1577127742868320256?s=20) for minors seeking an abortion. Lombardo also said he would [repeal protections](https://mynews4.com/news/local/interview-nevada-democratic-incumbent-governor-steve-sisolak-clark-county-sheriff-joe-lombardo-race-election-midterm-abortion-economy-inflation) for patients traveling from out of state to Nevada for abortion care, along with the Nevada providers that treated those patients. 

**Message:** Lombardo threatened the reproductive freedoms of women in Nevada and surrounding states.

### Lombardo Increased His Own Salary Amid Budget Cuts

-   As Clark County sheriff, Lombardo [used his authority](https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/04/26/715-million-lvmpd-to-request-8-increase-in-budget-but-no-new-officers/) to increase his own salary from $[141,000](https://www.nvsos.gov/SOSCandidateServices/AnonymousAccess/ViewCCEReport.aspx?syn=IeucW6fWGAywilg%252biHKCBQ%253d%253d) in 2015 to $[192,000](https://www.nvsos.gov/SOSCandidateServices/AnonymousAccess/ViewCCEReport.aspx?syn=C5i2BlxLnZX4Csfc%252fOXnHA%253d%253d) in 2022.
-   In the same breath, Lombardo [called for the Nevada state legislature](https://lasvegassun.com/news/2020/aug/10/policing-in-the-valley-is-at-a-crossroads/) to increase funding for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, claiming that pandemic budget cuts were hampering the department’s [“ability to police.”](https://lasvegassun.com/news/2020/aug/10/policing-in-the-valley-is-at-a-crossroads/) 

**Message:** Lombardo prioritized putting money in his own pocket over ensuring the safety of Las Vegas residents. 

### Lombardo Advanced Election Denial Claims, Worked To Roll Back Voting Access In Nevada, And Remained Closely Tied To A Fake Elector

-   In 2020, Lombardo claimed there was [fraud “on both sides”](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/nevada-election-denial-races-election-administration-positions) of the presidential election. Lombardo evaded questions about election accuracy and if Nevada would conduct an [Arizona-style nationwide audit of the 2020 Presidential election](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/lombardo-points-to-pandemic-state-lawmakers-as-crime-rates-rise).
-   Lombardo [opposed](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/on-the-record-gop-governor-candidate-joe-lombardo-on-covid-elections-and-k-12) universal mail-in-voting and supported policies to [restrict ballot access](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/nevada-election-denial-races-election-administration-positions). Lombardo suggested that [Nevada’s Signature Verification System was ineffective](https://youtu.be/eHKk3MazsVM).
-   Lombardo maintained [a longstanding relationship](https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/joe-lombardo-files-for-governor-in-carson-city-2545213/) with [Michael McDonald](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/report-nevada-gop-chairman-served-fbi-search-warrant-over-alternate-elector-actions), who led Nevada’s [fake elector scheme](https://www.8newsnow.com/investigators/i-team-sources-fbi-seizes-nevada-gop-chairmans-phone-as-part-of-fake-elector-investigation/) during the 2020 presidential election.

**Message:** Lombardo stood by Trump’s 2020 election lies and threatened Nevada’s election integrity.
