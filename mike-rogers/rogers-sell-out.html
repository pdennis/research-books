<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>While in the House, Mike Rogers authored and pushed the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA), which was incredibly controversial due to lack of civil liberties protections.</li>
  <li>The legislation was supported by AT&amp;T. At the same time, Rogers had received over $52,000 from AT&amp;T while serving in the House. After serving in Congress, Rogers would become the chief security adviser to AT&amp;T. Rogers’ chief of staff also became a lobbyist for AT&amp;T after serving in Rogers’ office.</li>
  <li>Rogers also became the chairman of 5G Action Now, whose priority it was to ensure the auction of C-Band Spectrum, the same priority as AT&amp;T.</li>
  <li>Rogers’ wife Kristi also benefitted from CISPA, as she ran a security defense contractor company.</li>

<h3><strong>Mike Rogers Authored AT&amp;T-Backed CISPA Legislation</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Mike Rogers Pushed CISPA, Which Was Backed By AT&amp;T. </strong>According to The Hill, “To protect the U.S. against a devastating cyberattack, Rogers said he planned to reintroduce a cybersecurity bill, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA), that would let the intelligence community share classified cyber threat information with private companies so they can protect their computer networks from a forthcoming attack in real time. He voiced opposition to applying new cybersecurity regulations on industry, arguing that companies are better equipped to protect their systems than the government is. However, he noted that the National Security Agency is doing great work on cybersecurity. ‘The government is not going to keep up. If we’re going to do this correctly, we’re talking about exchanging packets of information, zeroes and ones if you will, one hundred millions times a second,’ he said. ‘So some notion that this is a horrible invasion of content reading is wrong. It is not even close to that.’ The bill enjoyed support from a broad swath of companies, including Facebook and AT&amp;T, who said legal hurdles slowed down information sharing about cyber threats between industry and government.” [The Hill, <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/141381-house-intel-chairman-says-us-under-siege-from-cyberattacks/"><u>2/6/13</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Mike Rogers Authored CISPA, Which Was Backed By AT&amp;T. </strong>According to GovTech, “By a vote of 288 to 127, the House of Representatives in Washington D.C. passed a controversial cybersecurity (H.R. 624) bill on April 18 that would allow for real-time, voluntary and bi-directional information sharing between private companies and the government in the event of a cyber attack. The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (known as ‘CISPA’) was introduced last year, when it got bogged down in the Senate after passing the House. The bill was reintroduced this year, and is intended to break down legal barriers to sharing cybersecurity threat information between the intelligence community within private industry and the U.S. government with procedures established by the Director of National Intelligence. The CISPA authors are Reps. Mike Rogers (R-Michigan) and Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Maryland), the chairman and ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee. […]&nbsp; Supporters of CISPA include the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association, US Telecom Association, TechNet and these companies:&nbsp; McAfee, AT&amp;T, Comcast, IBM, Intel, Oracle, Verizon and Time Warner Cable.&nbsp; Facebook and Microsoft had been CISPA supporters but removed support recently.” [GovTech, <a href="https://www.govtech.com/security/cyber-intelligence-sharing-and-protection-act-passes-house.html"><u>4/18/13</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>AT&amp;T Said It Supported CISPA And Looked “Forward To Continuing To Work With” Mike Rogers. </strong>According to a statement from AT&amp;T, “The following may be attributed to Tim McKone, AT&amp;T Executive Vice President —Federal Relations: ‘AT&amp;T supports the ‘Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act of 2011’ as an important and positive step in strengthening cybersecurity collaboration. The sharing of cyber threat and attack information is an essential component of an effective cyber-defense strategy, and the legislation helps to provide greater clarity for private sector entities. We commend the bill’s sponsors for their leadership on this critical issue. As the legislation progresses, we look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Rogers, the committee and other stakeholders on this important endeavor.’” [Statement – AT&amp;T, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121212142423/http:/intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/ATT113011.pdf"><u>11/30/11</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>CISPA Was Controversial Due To Lack Of Civil Liberties Protections</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>CISPA Would Have Allowed Companies To Share Information With The Government And Did Not Require Protection of Internet Users’ Personal Data. </strong>According to ABC News, “• What is the purpose of CISPA? Michigan Republican Rep. Mike Rogers and Maryland Democratic Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger sponsored and, along with supporters, crafted CISPA to offer private companies new ways to protect themselves from potential economic cyberspies hailing from countries such as Russia and China. To accomplish this, the bill amends the National Security Act of 1947 (which contains no cyberthreat provisions) to increase information-sharing permission between U.S. businesses and the federal government. Supporters say information regarding cyberthreats will be more quickly and easily disseminated under CISPA. • Why is it controversial? Opponents aren't arguing against discussing cyberthreats, but they're concerned about the scope of sharing and privacy issues. Under CISPA, companies will be permitted to share information with entities such as the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency and won't be required to protect Internet users' personal data. The shared information is supposed to be related to cyberthreats, but many opponents argue that term is too broad and offers too many exemptions to current privacy laws.” [BC News, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/cispa-controversy-surrounding-affect/story?id=16229426"><u>4/27/12</u></a>]</p>

<p><strong>Mike Rogers Was Chief Security Adviser To AT&amp;T. </strong>According to CNBC, “Mike Rogers is a former member of Congress, officer in the Army, and FBI special agent. In the U.S. House he chaired the Intelligence Committee, becoming a leader on cybersecurity and national security policy, and overseeing the 17 intelligence agencies’ $70 billion budget.

<h3><strong>Mike Rogers Headed Nonprofit 5G Action Now, Which Did Not Disclose Donors But Pushed AT&amp;T’s Agenda</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Mike Rogers Was Paid $225,000 As Chairman Of 5G Action Now, Whose Priority Was To Ensure Public Action Of C-Band Spectrum</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2020: Mike Rogers Became Chairman Of 5G Action Now, Whose Priority Was To Ensure The Auction Of C-Band Spectrum. </strong>According to Fierce Wireless, “A new advocacy organization called 5G Action Now is sounding the alarm about how the U.S. needs to act fast in order to win the 5G race against China. The group, which yesterday announced former U.S. Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan as its chairman, said what’s at issue today is whether China or the United States takes the lead in deploying the technology and, therefore, reaps the economic rewards derived from dominance in 5G. Top of mind for the organization: The C-band, which was embroiled in debate much of last year. In November, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced the FCC is committed a public auction of 280 MHz of C-band spectrum, and the agency intends to get the spectrum teed up for auction by the end of this year.&nbsp; Rogers told FierceWireless that seeing that spectrum through to the auction is something 5G Action Now will be focused on. Besides satellite companies and the FCC, it will work with policy makers and the general public to make them aware of what’s at stake. The reason there’s a sense of urgency is ‘if we wait and 2020 passes us and we haven’t gotten to opening up that C-band spectrum, it gets exponentially harder for us to win this race on the 5G infrastructure,’ he said.” [Fierce Wireless, <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/5g-action-now-aims-to-win-5g-race-against-china-starting-c-band"><u>1/14/20</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>5G Action Did Not Disclose Sources Of Funding. </strong>According to Fierce Wireless, “The exact source of 5G Action Now’s funding seems a bit of a mystery. Light Reading earlier reported the connection between the C-Band Alliance (CBA) companies and 5G Action Now. While a CBA representative declined to comment to FierceWireless, a spokesman for 5G Action Now shared this statement: ‘The C-Band alliance is a strategic partner in that we share the goal of a 2020 public auction.’ He did not reveal the degree to which the CBA is involved, however, including financing.” [Fierce Wireless, <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/5g-action-now-aims-to-win-5g-race-against-china-starting-c-band"><u>1/14/20</u></a>]</li>

<h3><strong>Rogers’ Wife Also Benfitted From CISPA</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Rogers Wife, Kristi Rogers, Benefitted From CISPA’s Passage. </strong>According to Tech Dirt, “It would appear that Rep. Mike Rogers, the main person in Congress pushing for CISPA, has kept rather quiet about a very direct conflict of interest that calls into serious question the entire bill. It would appear that Rogers’ wife stands to benefit quite a lot from the passage of CISPA, and has helped in the push to get the bill passed. It’s somewhat amazing that no one has really covered this part of the story, but it highlights, yet again, the kind of activities by folks in Congress that make the public trust Congress less and less.” [Tech Dirt, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2013/04/18/oh-look-rep-mike-rogers-wife-stands-to-benefit-greatly-cispa-passing/"><u>4/18/13</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Rogers Refused To Acknowledge That CISPA Had Serious Privacy Concerns Because Of The Personal Benefits He Received From It. </strong>According to Tech Dirt, “It has seemed quite strange to see how strongly Rogers has been fighting for CISPA, refusing to even acknowledge the seriousness of the privacy concerns. At other times, he can’t even keep his own story straight about whether or not CISPA is about giving information to the NSA (hint: it is). And then there was the recent ridiculousness with him insisting that the only opposition to CISPA came from 14-year-old kids in their basement. Wrong and insulting. [Tech Dirt, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2013/04/18/oh-look-rep-mike-rogers-wife-stands-to-benefit-greatly-cispa-passing/"><u>4/18/13</u></a>]</p>
<h5><i>Rogers Received 15 Times More Money From Pro-CISPA Group That The Opposition Had Received From Anti-CISPA Groups</i></h5>
<p><strong>Rogers Received 15 Times More Money From Pro-CISPA Group That The Opposition Had Received From Anti-CISPA Groups.</strong> According to Tech Dirt, “Of course, as we’ve noted all along, all attempts at cybersecurity legislation have always been about money. Mainly, money to big defense contractors aiming to provide the government with lots of very expensive ‘solutions’ to the cybersecurity ‘problem’ — a problem that still has not been adequately defined beyond fake scare stories. Just last month, Rogers accidentally tweeted (and then deleted) a story about how CISPA supporters, like himself, had received 15 times more money from pro-CISPA group that the opposition had received from anti-CISPA groups.”</p>
<h4><strong><u>Roger’s Wife’s Security Defense Contractor Company, Aegis LLC, Would Benefit From CISPA</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Roger’s Wife’s Security Defense Contractor Company, Aegis LLC, Would Benefit From CISPA. </strong>According to Tech Dirt, “So it seems rather interesting to note that Rogers’ wife, Kristi Clemens Rogers, was, until recently, the president and CEO of Aegis LLC a ‘security’ defense contractor company, whom she helped to secure a $10 billion (with a b) contract with the State Department. The company describes itself as ‘a leading private security company, provides government and corporate clients with a full spectrum of intelligence-led, culturally-sensitive security solutions to operational and development challenges around the world.’ […] That sure seems like a rather key point, and a major conflict of interest that neither seemed interested in disclosing. Oh, and Kristi Rogers recently changed jobs as well, such that she’s now the ‘managing director of federal government affairs and public policies’ at Manatt a big lobbying firm, where (surprise, surprise) she’s apparently focused on ‘executive-level problem solving in the defense and homeland security sectors.’” [Tech Dirt, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2013/04/18/oh-look-rep-mike-rogers-wife-stands-to-benefit-greatly-cispa-passing/"><u>4/18/13</u></a>]</p>
<h5><i>Rogers Claimed He Could Not Sleep At Night Until CISPA Was Passed</i></h5>
<p><strong>Rogers Claimed He Could Not Sleep At Night Until CISPA Was Passed.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>According to Tech Dirt, “A few months ago, on one of his FUD-filled talks about why we need cybersecurity, Rogers claimed that it was all so scary that he literally couldn’t sleep at night until CISPA was passed due to an ‘unusual source’ threatening us. The whole statement seemed odd, until you realize that his statement came out at basically the same time as his wife’s fear-mongering article about cybersecurity. I guess when your pillow talk is made up boogeyman stories about threats that don’t actually exist, it might make it difficult to fall asleep. […] At the very least, in discussing all of this stuff, when Mrs. Rogers is writing articles that help the push for CISPA, it seems only fair to disclose that she’s married to the guy pushing for the bill. And when Mr. Rogers is pushing for the bill, it seems only right to disclose that his wife almost certainly would benefit” [Tech Dirt, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2013/04/18/oh-look-rep-mike-rogers-wife-stands-to-benefit-greatly-cispa-passing/"><u>4/18/13</u></a>]</p>
