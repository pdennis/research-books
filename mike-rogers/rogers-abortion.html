<h2><strong>Rogers Was An Anti-Abortion Extremist</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Rogers Supported “All Restrictions On ABortion” And Was “100 Perent Pro-Life”</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Mike Rogers: “I Support All Restrictions On Abortion.”</strong> According to the Lansing State Journal, “In recent years, the Michigan Legislature has placed limits on abortion – including a 24-hour waiting period and requiring minors to receive parental permission. What restrictions, if any, do you support on abortion? […] Mike Rogers R-Howell 1-546-9712 ‘I support all restrictions on abortion, since I consider it intentional taking of life. I would further support legislation restricting abortions done for choosing the sex of a baby.’” [Lansing State Journal, <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/209801658/?terms=%22mike%20rogers%22&amp;match=1"><u>10/24/94</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Mike Rogers Said He Would Fight Against Pro-Choice Proponents. </strong>According to the Livingston County Daily Press and Argus, “One issue on which Rogers agrees with Dillingham is abortion. ‘I commend him for championing the cause,’ Rogers said. Rogers said he would continue the fight against pro-choice and assisted suicide proponents.” [Livingston County Daily Press and Argus, <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/455364499/?terms=rogers&amp;match=1"><u>7/27/94</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Rogers Said He Was “100 Percent Pro-Life.” </strong>According to Mike Rogers’s responses to a general questionnaire, “I am 100 percent pro-life and believe that the only exception for abortion should be to save the life of the mother.” [Mike Rogers General Questionnaire, undated from the Mike Rogers Oakland University Collection]</p>
<p><strong>Rogers Said The Federal And States Governments Were Established To Protect “The Lives Of The Unborn” And Said Abortion “Should Be Legal Only To Prevent The Death Of The Mother.” </strong>According to MLive, “DO YOU SUPPORT ALLOWING ABORTIONS? IF YOU OPPOSE ABORTION, SHOULD THERE BE EXCEPTIONS?: — Rogers: I believe that the right to life is the most basic of all rights and is not to be taken with governmental sanction unless the individual has received proper due process under the law. I believe unborn children who are deprived of life, via abortion, have not received such required due process. Furthermore, I believe that federal and state governments were established to protect our lives and the lives of the unborn. I believe abortions should be legal only to prevent the death of the mother. I have always opposed efforts to use taxpayer dollars to fund any abortions and will continue to support long-standing federal laws (such as the Hyde Amendment) to prevent this practice.” [MLive, <a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2010/10/where_michigan_congress_hopefu.html"><u>10/18/10</u></a>]</p>
<h3><strong>Rogers Called Roe v. Wade A “Travesty” And Supported The Dobbs Decision</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Rogers Said That Legislators “Like Myself” Needed Strength To “Fight Against The Travesty That Roe V. Wade Has Visited Upon Our Land.” </strong>According to a letter written by Mike Rogers, “Our efforts for the cause of life do not go unheeded, nor does our persistence. As you join with tens of thousands of marchers from across America on Monday, I pray that your message will be heard and heeded on Capitol Hill and in State Houses across the nation. Legislators like myself need your strength and your courage to keep us strong in the fight against the travesty that Roe v. Wade has visited upon our land. Your commitment to this cause and the March for Life in Washington on Monday inspire us to fight on, to hold up the Word of God as our guiding principle, and to speak out on behalf of the unborn.” [Mike Rogers March For Life 2000 Letter, 1/22/2000]</p>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] Rogers Said “I Supported Roe V. Wade Going Back To The States.”</strong> “That's a state issue. I supported Roe v. Wade going back to the states. It did. Michiganders spoke loud and clear on that issue.” [Fox News Rundown, 1/18/24]; 240118_TTA_955_A</p>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Rogers Said “I Actually Supported Roe V. Wade Coming Back To The States.”</strong> “I actually supported Roe v. Wade coming back to the states. It's a hard, tough, emotional decision for every woman who has to even deal with this decision. My argument is that's why I wanted it back in the States. You’re closest to your doctor, you’re closest to your state legislator.” [WWJ-DET, 3/15/24]; 240315_SAG_5775_A</p>
<h3><strong>Rogers Opposed Codifying Abortion Rights In Michigan’s Constitution</strong></h3>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Mike Rogers Said If He Had Been In Michigan, He Would Have Voted Against Prop 3.&nbsp;</strong> “<u>Skubick</u>: If you had been here in Michigan, would you have supported Proposal 3? <u>Rogers</u>: I don’t believe, I’m not sure how it was written honestly.&nbsp; <u>Skubuck</u>: It was written basically to say a woman has a right to choose. And it legalized abortion. <u>Rogers</u>: Yeah, I probably wouldn’t have done it because it covers right up to the day of birth. And I’m not there. I don’t think most Americans are there. I think that’s kind of an extreme position candidly. I think what’s going to happen is they’re going to settle on a time in the future. I’ll put money on that.” [Off The Record Overtime, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/mar-3-2023-mike-rogers-otr-overtime-6l5k97/"><u>3/3/23</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Prop 3 Codified Abortion Rights In Michigan’s Constitution. </strong>According to ClickonDetroit, “Voters have approved a ballot proposal that will amend the Michigan Constitution to codify abortion rights in the state, NBC News projects. The proposal, an initiative by Reproductive Freedom for All, will legalize abortions and prevent people receiving or performing abortions from being criminally or civilly charged in Michigan. It was introduced in the state earlier this year in anticipation of the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, a landmark ruling from 1973 that protected the right to abortions nationwide.” [ClickonDetroit, <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/decision-2022/2022/11/09/michigan-voters-approve-proposal-3-to-codify-abortion-rights-nbc-news-projects/"><u>11/10/22</u></a>]</li>
