<h3><strong>Rogers Walked Through The “Revolving Door” For An “Explosion Of Immense Wealth”</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Rogers Walked Through The “Revolving Door” To Capitalize On His Office To Fuel “The Explosion Of Immense Wealth.” </strong>According to the Insider, “It’s a stark example of how the so-called ‘revolving door’ — where lawmakers, staffers, and other officials capitalize on their experience as they move between the public and private sectors — can fuel the explosion of immense wealth after years in public service.” [Insider, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mike-rogers-revolving-door-michigan-senate-financial-disclosures-2024-2"><u>2/12/24</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Rogers Quit Congress In 2014 To “Earn Considerable Amounts Of Money.” </strong>According to the Insider, “When former Rep. Mike Rogers decided to retire from Congress in 2014, money seemed to have been at least a little bit on his mind. The Michigan Republican’s aides told the New York Times at the time that Rogers would take up a new gig as a talk radio host in part to ‘earn considerable amounts of money’ and to take on ‘something more lucrative’ after years of public service.&nbsp; After all, being a member of Congress just doesn’t pay as well as the private sector: Lawmakers’ salaries have been capped at $174,000 a year since 2009. Nine years later, after briefly flirting with a presidential bid, Rogers is running for Senate in Michigan with the support of top Republicans. Over the last decade, according to property records and federal financial disclosure documents filed in 2015 and 2023, he made good on his quest to get rich.” [Insider, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mike-rogers-revolving-door-michigan-senate-financial-disclosures-2024-2"><u>2/12/24</u></a>]</p>
<h3><strong>Rogers Net Worth Skyrocketed To Over $5 Million After Leaving Congress</strong></h3>
<p><strong>When Leaving Congress, Rogers Had A Net Worth Between $800,000 And $1.7 Million. </strong>According to the Insider, “Rogers was by no means a destitute congressman, but his wealth was middling for a place where most of his colleagues are millionaires. As he prepared to exit Congress, he sold his home in Howell, Michigan for $137,500 in October 2014, property records show, leaving him without a Michigan residence. He also had two homes near Washington, including a nearly $1.1 million McLean home that he purchased in 2009 and a roughly $460,000 home on the Chesapeake bay in Grasonville, Maryland in 2014, which he sold early last year. But he also had significant mortgages on those homes, according to his 2015 disclosure, totaling between $750,000 and $1.5 million. Couple that with his disclosed investments at the time, and Rogers’ net worth was somewhere between $800,000 and $1.7 million.” [Insider, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mike-rogers-revolving-door-michigan-senate-financial-disclosures-2024-2"><u>2/12/24</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Rogers Net Worth After Leaving Congress Was Between $5.5 Million And $14.5 Million. </strong>According to Insider, “In sum, Rogers appears to have multiplied his net worth, disclosing between $5.5 and $14.5 million in various other investments, mostly mutual funds, along with over $3 million in real estate, including the new Michigan home, his Cape Coral residence, and the home in McLean. None of what Rogers has done in his years since Congress appears to be illegal — in fact, it’s the path that many former lawmakers take, with private companies eager to hire someone with subject-matter expertise, a high profile, and knowledge and connections in the halls of power. What makes Rogers’ case interesting is the fact that he’s required to lay it all out in the open via financial disclosures bookending his time in the private sector. All Senate and House members and candidates are required to do so, and separately, other candidates in the race are facing ethics complaints for missing or incomplete disclosures.” [Insider, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mike-rogers-revolving-door-michigan-senate-financial-disclosures-2024-2"><u>2/12/24</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Rogers Received $724,887 From IronNet, $191,000 From Mitre, $160,000 From D-Wave, And $20,000 From Telefonica. </strong>According to Insider, “And it paid off. In December, Rogers disclosed payments totaling roughly $1,975,000 since January 2022, including $724,887 from IronNet, which recently went bankrupt; $191,000 from MITRE; nearly $160,00 from D-Wave; and over $20,000 from Telefonica Ingenieria, a Spanish telecommunications company. Rogers also received $460,000 from Nokia in the last two years, despite little public information existing about his affiliation with the Finnish tech company. His campaign did not say what the Nokia payment was for, and representatives for the company did not respond to Business Insider’s request for comment. And despite no longer hosting his radio show, Rogers continues to make big bucks from being a public figure. He disclosed earning $32,000 from the Washington Speakers Bureau, as well as $17,540 for a speech to Carnival Cruise Line.” [Insider, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mike-rogers-revolving-door-michigan-senate-financial-disclosures-2024-2"><u>2/12/24</u></a>]</li>
