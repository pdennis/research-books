<h2><strong>Rogers Was Bad For Michigan Seniors</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Rogers Repeatedly Voted For The Ryan Budget Plan To Voucherize Medicare And Claimed It Was “Responsible”</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Rogers Repeatedly Voted To Turn Medicare Into A Voucher Program</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2009: Rogers Voted To Replace Medicare With A Premium Support Plan.</strong> In April 2009, Rogers voted to replace Medicare with a premium support plan, as part of Rep. Paul Ryan’s (R-WI) proposed budget resolution covering fiscal years 2010 to 2019. According to the House Budget Committee “To make the program sustainable and dependable, those 54 and younger will enroll in a new Medicare Program with health coverage similar to what is now available to Members of Congress and Federal employees; and they will receive a premium support payment equal to 100 percent of the Medicare benefit.” The vote was on adopting the budget as a substitute amendment, the amendment failed by a vote of 137 to 293. [House Vote 191, <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll191.xml"><u>4/2/09</u></a>; House Budget Committee, <a href="http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/pr20090401_gopbudget.pdf#page=31"><u>4/1/09</u></a>; Congressional Actions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/amendment/111th-congress/house-amendment/75/actions"><u>H.

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Premium Support Was Adjusted For Risk, Age, And Income.</strong> According to the House Budget Committee, “The reform targets support for those who truly need additional help. The premium support payment is risk-adjusted, so it increases with age and health status. It is income-related, so low income seniors receive extra support to cover out-of-pocket costs, and high-income seniors (those with household incomes exceeding the President’s benchmark level of $170,000) receive support relative to their annual incomes.” [House Budget Committee, <a href="http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/pr20090401_gopbudget.pdf#page=31"><u>4/1/09</u></a>]<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2011: Rogers Voted To Turn Medicare Into A Voucher Program.</strong> In April 2011, Rogers voted against preventing Medicare from becoming a voucher program as part of the Democrats’ proposed budget resolution covering FY 2012 to 2021. According the text of the budget resolution, “It is the policy of the House that the Medicare guarantee for seniors and persons with disabilities should be preserved and strengthened, and that any legislation to end the Medicare guarantee and shift rising health care costs onto seniors by replacing Medicare with vouchers or premium support for the purchase of private insurance should be rejected.” The vote was on an amendment to the House budget resolution replacing the entire budget with the House Democrats’ proposed budget; the amendment failed by a vote of 166 to 259.

  <li><strong>Rogers Claimed That The Budget Was A “Responsible Blueprint.” </strong>According to a press release from Congressman Mike Rogers, “The federal budget that the House passed today is an honest and responsible blueprint for finally tackling the growing spending crisis. It will lead to job creation and economic growth by cutting $6.2 trillion in spending from the president's budget. It will also set America on a course to pay off our massive $14 trillion national debt that is stifling job creation and stealing from the future of our children and grandchildren.” [Press Release – Congressman Mike Rogers, 4/15/11]</li>
  <li><strong>Rogers Claimed That The Budget Would “Protect Medicare.” </strong>According to a press release from Congressman Mike Rogers, “The 2012 budget reforms and protects Medicare to ensure it is available to future generations while making no changes to anyone who is currently 55 or above.an It also creates opportunities for prosperity and economic growth while repairing the social safety net for the vulnerable members of our society.” [Press Release – Congressman Mike Rogers, 4/15/11]</li>
  <li><strong>Ryan Plan Would Be The “End Of Medicare” And Would Voucherize The Program. </strong>According to ABC News, “Critics have called Ryan's 2011 proposal the ‘end of Medicare as we know it,’ and that's true. Until now, Medicare has operated as a ‘fee-for-service’ system; under Ryan's plan, it would operate more like a voucher system, although Ryan and his aides have resisted this term. Medicare would cease to pay for health services directly, instead operating as a board that approves a menu of health plans for public sale and doles out predetermined lumps of money to people enrolled in Medicare, to help them buy those plans.” [ABC News, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/paul-ryans-2011-medicare-plan-a-primer"><u>8/11/12</u></a>]</li>

<p><strong>2011: Rogers Voted For FY 2012 Ryan Budget, Which Replaced Medicare With A Premium Support Plan.</strong> In April 2011, Rogers voted for replacing Medicare with a premium support plan, as part of&nbsp; House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan’s (R-WI) proposed budget resolution covering fiscal years 2012 to 2021. According to the Congressional Research Service, “Under the new system, Medicare would pay a portion of the beneficiaries’ premiums, i.e., provide ‘premium support.’ The payments would be adjusted for age, health status, and income and would be paid directly by the government to the insurance plan selected by the Medicare beneficiary. In addition, plans with healthier enrollees, would be required to help subsidize plans with less healthy enrollees.” The vote was on passage; the resolution passed by a vote of 235 to 193.

  <li><strong>Wall Street Journal: Ryan Plan “Would Essentially End Medicare.” According to the Wall Street Journal, “Republicans will present this week a 2012 budget proposal that would cut more than $4 trillion from federal spending projected over the next decade and transform the Medicare health program for the elderly, a move that will dramatically reshape the budget debate in Washington. […] The plan would essentially end Medicare, which now pays most of the health-care bills for 48 million elderly and disabled Americans, as a program that directly pays those bills. Mr. Ryan and other conservatives say this is necessary because of the program's soaring costs.” [Wall Street Journal, </strong><a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703806304576240751124518520"><strong><u>4/4/11</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Ryan’s Budget Eliminated Traditional Medicare And Created A Medicare Exchange On Which Seniors Could Purchase Private Plans. According to the Congressional Research Service, “Individuals who become eligible (based either on age or disability) for Medicare in 2022 and later years would not be able to enroll in the current Medicare program. Instead, they would be given the option of enrolling in a private insurance plan through a newly established Medicare exchange.” [CRS Report #R41767, </strong><a href="http://op.bna.com/hl.nsf/id/bbrk-8fwsce/$File/CRShealthRyanApril2011.pdf#page=10"><strong><u>4/13/11</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Under Ryan’s Medicare Plan, Size Of Premium Support Payment Would Be Reduced In Line With Each Recipient’s Income. According to CBO, “The premium support payments [in the Ryan budget] would also vary with the income of the beneficiary. People in the top 2 percent of the annual income distribution of the Medicare-eligible population would receive 30 percent of the premium support amount described above; people in the next 6 percent of the distribution would receive 50 percent of the amount described above; and people in the remaining 92 percent of the distribution would receive the full premium support amount.” [CBO, </strong><a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12128/04-05-ryan_letter.pdf#page=10"><strong><u>4/5/11</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>

<p><strong>2012: Rogers Voted To Replace Medicare With A Premium Support Plan As Part Of The FY 2013 Ryan Budget.</strong> In March 2012, Rogers voted to replace Medicare with a premium support plan, as part of&nbsp; House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan’s (R-WI) proposed budget resolution covering fiscal years 2013 to 2022 According to the House Budget Committee, “For those workers currently under the age of 55, beginning in 2023, those seniors would be given a choice of private plans competing alongside the traditional fee-for-service option on a newly created Medicare Exchange. Medicare would provide a premium-support payment either to pay for or offset the premium of the plan chosen by the senior.” The vote was on passage; the resolution passed by a vote of 228 to 191. The Senate later rejected a motion to proceed to consider the House-passed budget resolution.

  <li><strong>Ryan’s Budget Created A Medicare Exchange Where Beneficiaries Could Choose From Private Insurance Or A Fee For Service Model. According to the Congressional Research Service, “Individuals who become eligible (based either on age or disability) for Medicare beginning in 2023 would be given the option of enrolling in a private insurance plan or a traditional fee-for-service option through a newly established Medicare exchange. These plans would be required to offer standard benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to traditional fee-for-service benefits, and to accept all people eligible for Medicare who apply regardless of age or health status.

<h3><strong>Rogers Called For “Private Sector Discipline” In Medicare</strong></h3>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] Rogers Wanted To Offer The Benefits That Congress Receives To The Standards Of Medicare. </strong>“6:24 MR - Well, first of all, we have to protect what we have both in Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid.&nbsp; I would like to see a bit of a change.&nbsp; I would like to see maybe an offering of what members of Congress get for most people.&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; They have a program that they go through.&nbsp; I think we ought to apply the same standards there to our Medicare providers.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Clap for that.&nbsp; You bet.&nbsp; And here's the good news.&nbsp; It injects some private sector discipline into the delivery of health care in a positive way.” [Mike Rogers, Southeast Michigan Chamber of Commerce Luncheon, Warren, Michigan, 2/28/24; 240228_TTA_1047_A, 240228_TTA_1047_B</p>
<p><strong>Rogers Advocated For Seniors On Medicare To “Have The Same Choices That Congressmen And Senators Do.”</strong> According to the Gannett News Service, “Michigan lawmakers reacting to President Bush's State of the Union speech split along party lines on the president's $674 billion tax cut plan, and on his proposal to tilt Medicare toward managed care and establish a prescription drug benefit for older Americans. The lawmakers also differed on how Bush should handle the threat posed by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's programs to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. United Nations inspectors presented a report Monday saying Iraq was not actively cooperating with them. ‘We can't do one other good thing in this country unless we're on solid footing where families are working and can support themselves. The president's proposal is a growth plan for America.’ -Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich. [...] ‘American senior citizens on Medicare should have the same choices that congressmen and senators do.’ -Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich.” [Gannett News Service, <a href="https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&amp;id=urn:contentItem:47TF-WCJ0-00C6-G503-00000-00&amp;context=1519360"><u>1/29/03</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>2.21 Million Michiganders On Medicare</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2.21 Million Michiganders Were Enrolled In Medicare. </strong>According to MHA, “The MHA recently updated its analysis of Medicare enrollment data to reflect Medicare enrollment as a percentage of each county’s total population and the split for Medicare between traditional fee-for-service (FFS) and Medicare Advantage (MA). Statewide, 22% of the total population is enrolled in Medicare. Total Medicare enrollment is approximately 2.21 million with 61% of beneficiaries enrolled in a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan. MA enrollment as a percentage of total Medicare enrollment varies by county, ranging from 45% to 76%. January enrollment is spread across 52 MA plans with up to 30 plans covering beneficiaries in some Michigan counties.” [MHA, <a href="https://www.mha.org/newsroom/updates-on-medicare-advantage-enrollment-in-michigan/"><u>3/22/04</u></a>]</p>

<p><strong>2011: Rogers Voted Against Raising The Medicare Eligibility Age To 67 By Two Months Every Year.</strong> In April 2011, Rogers voted to oppose raising the Medicare eligibility age to 67 by increasing the eligibility age by 2 months each year as part of the Republican Study Committee’s&nbsp; proposed budget resolution covering fiscal years 2012 to 2021. According to the Republican Study Committee, “To address the increased demands on Medicare, this budget proposes raising the age of Medicare eligibility by two months every year beginning with those born in 1952 until the eligibility age reaches 67 for those born in 1963. This proposal would not affect individual currently 60 years old and older.” The vote was on an amendment to the House budget resolution replacing the entire budget with the RSC’s proposed budget; the amendment failed by a vote of 119 to 136. In a tactical move, 172 Democrats voted “present” in order to force Republicans to either vote against their own proposal or else it would supersede Paul Ryan’s budget.

According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, “This means 65- and 66-year-olds would have neither Medicare nor access to health insurance exchanges in which they could buy coverage at an affordable price and receive subsidies to help them secure coverage if their incomes are low. This change would put many more 65- and 66-year-olds who don’t have employer coverage into the individual insurance market, where the premiums charged to people in this age group tend to be extremely high — thereby leaving many of them uninsured.” [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, </strong><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=3708"><strong><u>3/20/12</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>

  <li><strong>Increasing The Medicare Eligibility Age Would Raise The Costs Of Healthcare Across The Economy. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, “raising Medicare’s eligibility age would not only fail to constrain health care costs across the economy; it would raise them. Medicare provides health coverage more cheaply than private health insurance plans because it has lower administrative costs and pays less to providers. Raising the Medicare age would shift costs to most of the 65- and 66-year olds who would lose Medicare coverage, to remaining Medicare beneficiaries, to employers that provide coverage for their retirees, and to states. These cost increases would, in total, more than offset the savings to the federal government.” [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, </strong><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=3731"><strong><u>3/28/12</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>

Bush has proposed a privatization plan to keep Social Security solvent by allowing individuals to invest a small portion of their Social Security tax in a private investment fund. Although Rogers supports the plan, he said his first priority is to let people know their benefits will be there at the same level for current user and it will also be there for future retirees. ‘In the future we will have to make some changes, but benefits will not be changed,’ he said. ‘We need to make it solvent.’” [Livingston County Daily Press and Argus, 8/16/00]</p>
<p><strong>Rogers Claimed That He Would Support A Plan To Allow A Portion Of People’s Social Security Taxes To Go Into The Stock Market For Themselves. </strong>According to the Lansing State Journal, “Byrum said she opposes Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush's proposal to let workers invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in the stock market for themselves. ‘It would cost a trillion dollars and cut the solvency by 14 years,'’ she said.

<p><strong>2010: Rogers Wanted To Examine “Every Social Security Reform Option” And Left The Door Open To Privatization.</strong> According to The Associated Press, “Should workers be allowed to invest a portion of their payroll tax in private accounts managed by private firms contracted by the government, or should social security be left the way it is? Why or why not?: Rogers: I believe Social Security is a solemn promise. The government must honor its pledge to America's senior citizens who rely on Social Security. As the demographics of Social Security have changed, the workers paying into the fund have decreased dramatically to three workers for one retiree. By 2018, Social Security will pay out more to retirees than it is currently taking in. I also believe that it is necessary to provide future generations with a secure retirement. By examining every Social Security reform option, I am hopeful that Congress can provide a plan that benefits all, especially those who depend on monthly Social Security checks.” [Associated Press, 10/18/10]</p>
