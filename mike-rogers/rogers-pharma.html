<h2><strong>Rogers Was In The Pocket Of Big Pharma</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Rogers Was Supported By Big Pharma</strong></h3>
<p><strong>During His Time In The House, Rogers Received $673,390 From Pharmaceuticals/Health Products Industry.</strong> [OpenSecrets, accessed <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/mike-rogers/industries?cid=N00009668&amp;cycle=CAREER"><u>5/1/24</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>June 2003: Novartis Took Mike Rogers On A Corporate Jet To A Fundraiser. </strong>According to USA Today, “Frist and Hastert are not the only lawmakers to take advantage of the convenience of drug companies' corporate jets. A spokesman for drugmaker Novartis, Sheldon Jones, confirmed that company lobbyists were aboard for three trips carrying lawmakers in 2003 and 2004. One, in June 2003, took Reps. Tom Reynolds, R-N.Y.; Mike Oxley, R-Ohio; and Mike Rogers, R-Mich., to a Republican fundraiser in New York City. Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., and Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., also took trips on the Novartis Learjet.” [USA Today, 4/26/05]</p>
<p><strong>Rogers Was A “Major Recipient Of Pharmaceutical Money.” </strong>According to the Associated Press, “Drug companies gave generously to many Michigan lawmakers this election, but those who oppose the reimportation of drugs from Canada got a much larger windfall than others. Fifteen drug companies gave a total of $134,744 to ten U.S. House and Senate members from Michigan as of Oct. 13, according to federal campaign finance records compiled by The Associated Press and the nonpartisan group PoliticalMoneyLine. Ninety-five percent of that total - $128,189 - went to five U.S. House members who oppose reimportation. The rest went to lawmakers who support reimportation, including four House members and Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow. Drug companies, along with President Bush and the Food and Drug Administration, oppose reimportation because they say there's no way to guarantee the safety of drugs coming in from other countries. Supporters say that's a scare tactic designed to protect drug companies' profits. […] Two other Michigan members of the Energy and Commerce Committee also were major recipients of pharmaceutical money. Rogers, a Republican from Brighton, took in $38,214 and Upton, a Republican from St. Joseph, took in $33,000.” [Associated Press, 10/27/04]</p>
<p><strong>Pharmaceutical Companies Were Top Industry Contributor To Mike Rogers. </strong>According to the Livingston County Press, “At a briefing in Washington, D.C., last week, Rogers and Green were joined by pharmaceutical executives and a representative of the National Associations of Boards of Pharmacy. Health professionals and pharmaceutical companies were the two top industry contributors to Rogers' campaign war chest in the 2006 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, donating $118,954 and $75,589 respectively. But Rogers said only ‘people who have political motivations might say that’ those contributions relate to his introduction of the bill.” [Livingston County Press, 4/2/07]</p>
<h3><strong>Rogers Opposed Drug Reimportation</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>2003: Rogers Voted Against Allowing The Re-Importation Of Prescription Drugs</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2003: Rogers Voted Against Allowing The Re-Importation Of Prescription Drugs From Several Foreign Countries, Such As Canada.</strong> In July 2003, Rogers voted against a bill that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, “require[d] the Food and Drug Administration to establish a program that would [have] allow[ed] the importation of FDA-approved prescription drugs from FDA-approved facilities in the European Union, Australia, Canada, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Lichtenstein, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and South Africa.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 243 to 186. The Senate took no substantive action on the measure. [House Vote 445, <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2003/roll445.xml"><u>7/25/03</u></a>; Congressional Quarterly, <a href="http://www.cq.com/doc/floorvote-86959000"><u>7/25/03</u></a>; Congressional Actions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/2427/all-actions"><u>H.R. 2427</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Supporters Argued The Measure Would Save Americans $600 Billion On Prescription Drugs Over 10 Years By Lowering Prices. According to the Congressional Record Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) said, “We all have a stake in driving drug prices down. Last week, the Congress of the United States abrogated its responsibility to address the problem of soaring drug prices. It did worse than nothing, barring the government from negotiating lower prices for seniors. We can strike a blow for lower prices with a simple step, giving ordinary Americans the choice they are taking on their own out of desperation. It should be legal to reimport drugs from some countries. This alone would save Americans $600 billion in the next decade, savings passed directly on to the consumer. We know that this is a safe option. In 2001, U.S. drug companies reimported $14.7 billion worth of brand name medications from their overseas plants.” [Congressional Record, </strong><a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/citation.result.CREC.action?congressionalRecord.volume=149&amp;congressionalRecord.pagePrefix=H&amp;congressionalRecord.pageNumber=7598&amp;publication=CREC"><strong><u>7/24/03</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>

<h5><i>Editorial Criticized Rogers’ Vote</i></h5>
<p><strong>Lansing State Journal Editorial: “Citizens In Mid-Michigan Might Want To Ask Reps. Mike Rogers, R-Brighton, And Dave Camp, R-Midland, Why They Think Reimportation Is Such A Bad Idea.”</strong> According to a Lansing State Journal editorial, “Citizens should be clear about something: Should Congress legalize the reimportation of cheaper drugs from Canada and elsewhere, America's drug cost crisis will not end. But there was no fundamental reason to vote against the measure, which cleared the House last week. So, citizens in mid-Michigan might want to ask Reps. Mike Rogers, R-Brighton, and Dave Camp, R-Midland, why they think reimportation is such a bad idea. Proponents' arguments are simple. Certain prescription drugs used by millions of Americans sell at lower prices outside America's borders than inside them. This fact spurred the creation of a "gray" market in which senior citizens would ride buses into Canada to buy drugs, or purchase them on the Internet. This has freaked out the pharmaceutical industry, which has pressured Congress, the White House and the Food and Drug Administration to keep the practice illegal.” [Editorial – Lansing State Journal, 8/4/03]</p>
<h5><i>Rogers Defended His Vote Against Reimportation Bill</i></h5>
<p><strong>Rogers Defended His Vote And Said “Reimported Drugs Can Be Extremely Unsafe And Neither Of Us Is Willing To Take That Risk With Our Own Parents Or Yours.”</strong> According to a Mike Rogers and Dave Camp op-ed in the Lansing State Journal, “A Lansing State Journal editorial describes legislation we voted against as not perfect but ‘worth a look’ (‘Let drugs in,’ Aug. 4). If anyone truly believes that, would they be willing to have their own older parents take reimported drugs? What if they knew the risks involved? Would any American family be willing to put their parents at risk of counterfeit, misbranded, fake or outdated prescription drugs? We certainly are not. Consider: * Two American children - a 15-year-old and an 18-month-old - died from misbranded, unapproved drugs smuggled from another country. * A 33-year-old mother died of an overdose of painkillers ordered without a prescription from an Internet pharmacy of unknown origin. * A senior citizen worsened after a bus trip to Canada to purchase a medication which failed to perform. * An Internet site, ‘Canada's Number One Pharmacy,’ actually originates in Barbados. * A Canadian television station purchased drugs from Mexico and Brazil, with no government oversight, despite law enforcement projections that 25 percent to 50 percent of medications sold in those two countries are counterfeit. * Federal law enforcement investigations uncovered offshore prescription drug shipments in U.S. postal facilities - many with no active ingredients, others outdated and some mislabeled. * A 1998 Canadian Solicitor General report said organized crime there had become heavily involved in the sale of counterfeit pharmaceutical products. The list of concerns could go on, but the bottom line is this: Reimported drugs can be extremely unsafe and neither of us is willing to take that risk with our own parents or yours.” [Mike Rogers and Dave Camp Op-Ed – Lansing State Journal, 8/8/03]</p>
<p><strong>Rogers Complained That The Canadian Government Would Not Guarantee The Safety Of The Drugs One Of Its Stores Is Selling. </strong>According to the Detroit News, “The state of Michigan may follow the lead of hundreds of Michigan senior citizens who regularly save money by purchasing their prescription drugs from Canada. A spokesman for the Michigan Department of Community Health said Gov. Jennifer Granholm is interested in recent moves by Illinois, Minnesota and Iowa to investigate buying drugs from Canada for state workers and Medicaid recipients. Granholm wants state officials to study the results of investigations now under way in those three states and determine whether a similar plan could work in Michigan, T.J. Bucholz said Tuesday. […] Larry Wagenknecht, chief executive officer of the Michigan Pharmacists Association in Lansing, said the state Department of Consumer and Industry Services has not acted on his group's complaint that the American Drug Club is not a licensed pharmacy and has no licensed pharmacist on staff. Elizabeth Boyd, a Granholm spokeswoman, was not able to determine the status of the complaint Tuesday. U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Brighton, sent Granholm a letter Monday urging her to take action against the Lansing outlet because ‘the health of our constituents is at risk.’ Rogers complained the Canadian government will not guarantee the safety of the drugs the store is selling.” [Detroit News, 10/1/03]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Rogers Criticized Drug Reimportation</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Rogers Said “Price Controls From Canada Will Not Work.”</strong> “Rogers: Government price controls don’t work, where we have seen real progress in the pricing of is when we introduce the free market. The Medicare part D was actually 8 billion dollars less than we thought. Why? Because the private market was competing on plans, and what happened? The costs of those plans went down. We actually have a plan that will save Michigan 13.05 a plan and have access to prescription drugs and 300,000. are subsidized. It is exciting it is amazing and you know what is working on that? Not government price control, health savings accounts, it is the only provision in health care today were cost are being reduced why because the consumer is involved on the decisions on health care. And it provided about 3 million American citizens with health care that never had health care before, so one thing and the things we know are working are the private sector, price controls, bigger government, price controls from Canada will not work, the private sector is working and we ought to expand that sector.” [2006 Mike Rogers Congressional Debate – accessed via Oakland University archive, 2006]</p>
<p><strong>FDA Week: “Rogers Does Not Support Reimportation And Held A Briefing On Drug Counterfeiting With Industry Security Experts And The National Association Of Boards Of Pharmacies.”</strong> According to FDA Week, “Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI) made a pitch Tuesday (July 25) for his bill to increase penalties for drug counterfeiters and touted the legislation as a bridge between supporters and opponents of reimportation. Despite saying he did not want the briefing on drug counterfeiting to turn into a reimportation debate, talk inevitably turned to Internet prescription drugs from Canada. Rogers does not support reimportation and held a briefing on drug counterfeiting with industry security experts and the National Association of Boards of Pharmacies to reveal a prescription drug climate rife with dangerous counterfeiting at a time when Congress is considering proposals that would halt reimportation enforcement. Opponents of reimportation, which FDA views as illegal, claim opening the door for cheaper prescription medications from other countries also leaves huge security gaps for terrorists and counterfeiters to infiltrate the American drug supply chain.” [FDA Week, 7/28/06]</p>
<p><strong>Rogers Said “What We Are Doing Is Throwing Open The Gates To Every Counterfeiter In The World.”</strong> According to Congressional Quarterly, “Critics argued that the language, barring the Food and Drug Administration from enforcing a ban on prescription imports, would make Americans vulnerable to unreliable and even dangerous medications. ‘What we are doing is throwing open the gates to every counterfeiter in the world,’ said Mike Rogers, R-Mich.” [Congressional Quarterly, 8/2/07]</p>
<h3><strong>Rogers Opposed Medicare Negotiating Drug Prices</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Rogers Supported Legislation Barring Medicare From Negotiating Drug Prices</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Rogers Supported Legislation That Explicitly Barred Medicare From Negotiating Bulk Discounts. </strong>According to a Lansing State Journal editorial, “Michigan has launched a new prescription drug discount program to reach as many as 200,000 low-income residents. These citizens will be eligible for discounts because the state is able to buy drugs in bulk, allowing it to negotiate discounts. The idea is so simple, so positive, it is hard to believe that any policy-makers would reject it. Yet that's what Congress and President Bush did last year with the Medicare prescription drug law. That law - supported by Republican Congressman Mike Rogers, Dave Camp and Vern Ehlers - explicitly barred Medicare from negotiating bulk discounts. And with tens of millions of clients, you can imagine how much clout Medicare could have had with the pharmaceutical firms.” [Editorial – Lansing State Journal, 9/27/04]</p>
<h5><i>Editorials Blasted The Prohibition</i></h5>
<p><strong>Lansing State Journal Editorial: “Medicare Can’t Negotiate Because Drug Company Lobbyists Said They Didn't Want It - And Carried The Day.”</strong> According to a Lansing State Journal editorial, “Now, we have yet to hear a single policy argument for why bulk purchases are bad for the public; or why the Medicare law carries the discount prohibition. And state policy-makers just can't be that much smarter than their national counterparts. That means there has to be another explanation; an explanation that goes beyond the public interest, that goes beyond the skill of Congress. The only one that fits is that Medicare can't negotiate because drug company lobbyists said they didn't want it - and carried the day. It is not a pleasant thing to accuse elected officials of out-and-out rejecting a public benefit. But if Michigan is right to negotiate discounts for its needy citizens, than Washington has to be wrong in not doing the same for Medicare. Right?” [Editorial – Lansing State Journal, 9/27/04]</p>
<p><strong>Lansing State Journal Editorial: “The Program Is A Giveaway To Pharmaceutical Firms Because Congress Barred Medicare From Negotiating Deep Discounts In Drug.”</strong> According to a Lansing State Journal editorial, “The program is a giveaway to pharmaceutical firms because Congress barred Medicare from negotiating deep discounts in drug prices - a practice used effectively in other government programs. And now we can see the program is overwhelmed by the administrative burden of trying to keep track of so many seniors with widely different medical and financial needs. It could have been different, of course. A drug benefit targeted solely to the neediest seniors - as established by personal income and drug use - is feasible. It wouldn't overwhelm the Treasury or government computers. It could be in operation now, had Congress not, instead, endorsed the existing, flawed law - thanks in large measure to mid-Michigan Congressmen Dave Camp, Vern Ehlers and Mike Rogers.” [Editorial – Lansing State Journal, 1/18/06]</p>
<h4><strong><u>2007: Rogers Voted Against Requiring Negotiation Of Prices For Prescriptions Drugs</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2007: Rogers Voted Against Requiring Negotiation Of Prices For Prescriptions Drugs In Medicare Part D. </strong>According to the Livingston County Press, “U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Brighton, voted against four out of the six major bills approved by the new Democratic House majority. The only two parts of the Democrats' so-called "first 100 hours" agenda that Rogers supported were a proposal to lower interest rates on student loans and approval of the recommendations of the Sept. 11 commission. The other measures passed by the Democrats were an increase in the federal minimum wage; allowing federal funding for embryonic stem cell research; requiring negotiation of prices for prescription drugs in the Medicare Part D program; and eliminating some tax breaks for oil companies.” [Livingston County Press, 1/22/07]</p>
<p><strong>2007: Rogers Voted Against Requiring The Secretary Of Health And Human Services To Negotiate Prices Of Prescription Drugs In Medicare Part D.</strong> In January 2007, Rogers voted against a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, “would [have] require[d] the Health and Human Services (HHS) Department to negotiate with drug companies the prices of drugs covered under the Medicare Part D prescription drug program.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 255 to 170. The bill was then sent to the Senate, where no further action was taken.

  <li><strong>At The Time, Individual Drug Plans Could Negotiate Drug Prices, But Medicare As A Whole Could Not Do So. </strong>According to The Oklahoman, “Currently, Medicare cannot negotiate drug prices. Individual insurance companies contract with Medicare to provide prescription drug coverage, and only they are allowed to negotiate with manufacturers and wholesalers.” [The Oklahoman, 1/12/07]</li>
  <li><strong>Supporters Of The Legislation Claimed It Would Save $96 Billion Over 10 Years. </strong>According to The Oklahoman, “Supporters of the House measure, called the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act, said it would save $96 billion over 10 years. ‘This will deliver lower premiums to the seniors, lower prices at the pharmacy, and savings for all taxpayers,’ said Representative John Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.” [The Oklahoman, 1/12/07]</li>
  <li><strong>Opponents Of The Legislation Claimed That Giving HHS The Ability To Negotiate Would Not Significantly Reduce Drug Prices And Therefore Have Little, If Any, Effect On Federal Spending. </strong>According to The Oklahoman, “Several government officials […] said enabling Medicare - through the secretary of health and human services - to negotiate with drug companies would not drastically cut drug prices. The bill ‘would have a negligible effect on federal spending because we anticipate that the secretary would be unable to negotiate prices across the broad range of covered Part D drugs that are more favorable than those obtained by the prescription drug plans,’ wrote the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan research arm of Congress.” [The Oklahoman, 1/12/07]</li>
