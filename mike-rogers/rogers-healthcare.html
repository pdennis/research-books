<h2><strong>Rogers Opposed Access To Affordable Health Care</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Rogers Criticized The Affordable Care Act</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Rogers Said The Health Care Bill Would Have Deadly Consequences. </strong>According to the Livingston County Press, “The health-care debate in Washington has become a game of political gain, and proposed legislation will have costly - and in some cases deadly - consequences, said U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Brighton. Rogers heavily criticized the health-care bills approved in the U.S. House and Senate on Monday during a visit to the Daily Press &amp; Argus. Congress is expected to hash out differences between the two different versions of the bills in the coming weeks.” [Livingston County Press, 1/5/10]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rogers Said The Health Care Bill “Just Sentenced To Death 36,000 American Women” Because Government Panels Would Decide Who Gets Services. </strong>According to the Livingston County Press, “Rogers said the proposed federal health insurance exchange - which would establish coverage standards and be overseen by a commissioner - could bar people from essential services, such as mammograms for women. He said a government-appointed panel's conclusion that women need fewer mammograms at certain ages would be incorporated in the bills. Rogers, himself a cancer survivor, said the government shouldn't dictate who has access to mammograms. ‘I said, 'Oh, my gosh. They just sentenced to death 36,000 American women,' ‘ he said.” [Livingston County Press, 1/5/10]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rogers Said The Estimated Cost Of The Bill Would Likely Outweigh The Financial Hit Of The Uninsured Receiving Health Services Without Paying For Them And Claimed It Was A “Financial Train Wreck.” </strong>According to the Livingston County Press, “As written, the health-care legislation wouldn't go into effect until 2013, though tax collection would begin immediately, Rogers said. He said the estimated cost of proposed health-care reform will most likely outweigh the financial hit of the uninsured receiving health services without paying for them. Rogers said the bills call for a large-scale expansion of Medicaid, health-care coverage administered by the states with some federal funding. ‘It's a financial train wreck,’ Rogers said.” [Livingston County Press, 1/5/10]</p>
<p><strong>Rogers Claimed It Would Eventually Be “Illegal” To Have A Private Insurance Plan. </strong>According to the Livingston County Press, “He said the health exchange would eventually make it ‘illegal’ to have a private insurance plan. The exchange would enforce plan requirements for employer-provided health coverage. Rogers said ideas he supports, such as high-risk insurance pooling, expanding access to health savings accounts, and allowing insurance sales across state lines, have been mostly ignored in Congress. He said he also supports expansion of federally qualified health centers, which provide subsidized health care for the uninsured.” [Livingston County Press, 1/5/10]</p>
<p><strong>Rogers Was “Disgusted” That Congress And The White House Were “Using Dishonestly To Ram Their Ideas For Social Engineering Down The Throats Of The American People.”</strong> According to a press release from Representative Mike Rogers, “‘The American people are angry about a strong-arm government takeover of health care,’ Rogers said. ‘Worst, Democrat leaders are lying, cheating and stealing to get a bill passed that is terrible for American families and our future generations. Few things in life are as personal as our health care, especially if we are caring for young children or older family members. In 'plain speak,' and right from my heart as a father, a brother, a son, and a cancer survivor, I spoke during that hearing based on principle, not politics or position. Obviously more than 7 million Americans share my concerns about the government taking over our health care and paying for it with more taxes, higher premiums, and limits on who can get certain kinds of care. I am disgusted with this Congress and the White House for abandoning our nation's founding principles and using dishonesty to ram their ideas for social engineering down the throats of the American people. It is time to speak the truth, and to speak plainly, about what is best for our nation and not what is best for political power.’” [Press Release – Representative Mike Rogers, 3/19/10]</p>
<p><strong>Rogers: “I Have Never Seen Such Lying, Cheating, And Stealing To Get A Bill Passed In My Entire Career… It’s Shocking How Arrogant And Bold And Dishonest All Of This Has Become.”</strong> According to the Livingston County Press, “U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Brighton, said the Obama administration will take any measures necessary - including Air Force One rides and extravagant meals - to earn votes for the president's health-care initiative. [...] Rogers said&nbsp; House Democrats are doing whatever is necessary to pass the bill, which he said includes benefits to individual states and a seemingly unrelated ‘government takeover’ of student loans. He said the projected $940 billion health-care overhaul would create higher taxes and health premiums, and massive cuts to Medicare coverage. ‘I am disgusted with our Congress. I have never seen such lying, cheating and stealing to get a bill passed in my entire career,’ Rogers said. ‘It's shocking how arrogant and bold and dishonest all of this has become,’ he added. Rogers said he hopes the ‘seas will part’ and ‘common sense’ will prevail before Sunday, when votes on the legislation are expected.” [Livingston County Press, 3/19/10]</p>
<p><strong>Rogers Claimed That The ACA Would “Cause The Loss Of 4 At Least Million Jobs Nationally” And Pushed For Alternatives.</strong> According to the Livingston County Press, “Rogers countered the legislation would cause the loss of at least 4 million jobs nationally because it would result in heavy taxation on small businesses to comply with the law and provide health care to employees. He said the legislation would result in even greater premium hikes for both employers and employees through increased government regulations and reduced competition. ‘There is no way in the world you can add this much cost to the system and not lose jobs. That money doesn't appear from nowhere,’ he said. He continues to push for measures to allow the purchase of health-care polices across state lines; expansion of health savings accounts; and creation of high-risk pools to provide coverage for people with costly pre-existing health conditions to lower costs and increase competition among health insurance companies. ‘You watch at how the prices start to go down,’ Rogers said.” [Livingston County Press, 3/19/10]</p>
<h3><strong>Rogers Voted Against The Affordable Care Act</strong></h3>
<p><strong>2010: Rogers Voted Against The Patient Protection And Affordable Care Act.</strong> In March 2010, Rogers voted against the Senate-passed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill “overhaul[ed] the nation's health insurance system and require[d] most individuals to buy health insurance by 2014. It […] create[d] a system of national private insurance plans supervised by the Office of Personnel Management and create[d] state-run marketplaces for purchasing health insurance. Those who do not obtain coverage would be subject to an excise tax. Excluded from the mandate [were] those exempt from filing income tax and others with a hardship waiver, religious objection or those who cannot afford coverage. Employers with more than 50 workers […] ha[d] to provide coverage or pay a fine if any employee gets a subsidized plan on the exchange. Certain small businesses [got] tax credits for providing coverage, and those with low incomes, excluding illegal immigrants, [got] subsidies. It […] bar[red] the use of federal funds to pay for abortions in the new programs, except in the cases of rape or incest or if the woman's life is in danger. Insurance companies could not deny coverage based on pre-existing medical conditions beginning in 2014, and could not drop coverage of people who become ill. It […] expand[ed] eligibility for Medicaid, shr[u]nk the coverage gap under the Medicare Part D prescription drug program and create[d] an advisory board to reduce the per capita growth rate in Medicare spending.” The vote was on agreeing to the Senate bill, which was packaged as a Senate amendment to another, unrelated House bill. The House agreed to the Senate amendment by a vote of 219 to 212, sending the amended bill to the president, who signed it into law.

<h4><strong><u>Rogers Said The Vote Was A “Disgrace”</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Rogers Called The ACA “A Disgrace” After The House Vote And Claimed The Legislation Had “Dirty Deal After Dirty Deal.”</strong> According to the Detroit Free Press, “‘There is dirty deal after dirty deal after dirty deal in the bill this House will vote on. It is a disgrace.’ Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich.” [Detroit Free Press, 3/22/10]</p>
<h3><strong>Rogers Supported Repealing The Affordable Care Act</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Rogers Called For Repeal Of The Affordable Care Act. </strong>According to the Livingston County Press, “ Incumbent U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Brighton, said Congress must repeal the new health-care reforms and maintain tax cuts among America's top earners to boost the economy and create jobs. Rogers' Democratic challenger, East Lansing resident Lance Enderle, disagreed on both fronts and said getting Rogers out of Washington, D.C., is the first step toward progress. Rogers and Enderle will face off on the Nov. 2 general election ballot for Michigan's 8th Congressional District seat, which represents all of Livingston, Ingham and Clinton counties and part of Oakland and Shiawassee counties in the U.S. House.” [Livingston County Press, 10/7/19]</p>
<p><strong>Rogers Said “I Support Repealing” The Affordable Care Act. </strong>According to a Citizen op-ed by Mike Rogers, “ This charade is the clearest indication yet that the health law has failed to live up to the president’s often repeated promise that if you like your health plan, you can keep it. That promise has already been broken for workers with mini-med plans, and millions of other small business health plans will soon be deemed ‘unacceptable coverage? in the eyes of HHS bureaucrats. I believe every American deserves an exemption from the health care law, not just political friends of the Obama administration and Fortune 500 companies. That is why I support repealing the law and passing commonsense reforms that lower costs for everyone and put families in charge of their health care, not the government. Make no mistake, most people won’t be lucky enough to get an exemption from the secretary of HHS. Families in Michigan are still asking ‘how does the health care law impact me??” [Mike Rogers Op-Ed – The Citizen, 1/18/11]</p>
<p><strong>2011: Rogers Voted To Repeal The Affordable Care Act.</strong> In January 2011, Rogers voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, “would [have] repeal[ed] the 2010 health care overhaul law, which requires most individuals to buy health insurance by 2014, makes changes to government health care programs and sets new requirements for health insurers. The bill would restore the provisions of law amended or repealed by the health care overhaul, and repeal certain provisions of the health care reconciliation law.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 245 to 189; however, the Senate did not take any action on it. [House Vote 14, <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll014.xml"><u>1/19/11</u></a>; Congressional Quarterly, <a href="http://www.cq.com/doc/floorvote-227213000"><u>1/19/11</u></a>; Congressional Actions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/2/all-actions"><u>H.R. 2</u></a>]</p>
<h3><strong>Rogers Introduced Legislation Allowing Individuals And Employers To Apply For Waivers</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Rogers Introduced Legislation To Allow All Employers And Individuals To Apply For Waivers To The Affordable Care Act.</strong> According to the Livingston County Press, “U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Brighton, is leading a charge to allow all employers and individuals to apply for waivers to federal health-care reforms enacted last year. Rogers introduced a bill today that would expand the waiver process, which he said has granted more than 1,000 waivers primarily to Fortune 500 corporations and unions. He said individuals and small businesses have been excluded from the waiver process, and that he would address that through his proposed Health Care Waiver Fairness Act. Rogers said the proposal has bipartisan support.” [Livingston County Press, 3/10/11]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rogers Said It Was “A Matter Of Fairness.” </strong>According to a Congressman Mike Rogers press release, “U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-MI, has introduced a bill that would expand the waiver process in the new health care law to all Americans and employers. ‘It's a matter of fairness,’ said Rogers, a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Health. ‘Every American and employer deserves the opportunity to receive a waiver from the new health care law if it's driving up costs and limiting services, not just the politically connected.’ The Obama Administration has granted more than 1,000 waivers to its new health care law, but they are mostly limited to Fortune 500 corporations, unions and most recently a state. Individuals and small businesses have been excluded from the process. The bipartisan Health Care Waiver Fairness Act would alleviate that disparity.” [Press Release – Congressman Mike Rogers, 3/10/11]</li>

<h3><strong>Rogers “Opposed Obamacare At Every Turn”</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Rogers: “I Opposed Obamacare At Every Turn.”</strong> Representative Mike Rogers tweeted, “I opposed Obamacare at every turn.
