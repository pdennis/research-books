>American Bridge 21st Century is the largest research, tracking, and rapid-response operation in the Democratic Party, focused on holding Republicans accountable and helping deliver Democratic victories. This site exists to freely publish our research books on Republicans running for every level of government—so the most important facts are public, citable, and usable by anyone working to inform voters. Journalists, data firms, advertisers, organizers, digital creators, and voters themselves can use these materials to understand Republicans’ records, develop messaging, and create effective content and ads grounded in primary-source documentation.
