# How To Win Against Mariannette Miller-Meeks

Miller-Meeks is wrong for IA-01. She voted to kick thousands of Iowans off their health insurance, to make it harder for Iowans to afford groceries, and defended tariffs that jack up costs, are crushing Iowa farmers, and hurt local jobs. She backed a scheme aligned with cuts to medical research and customer service at Social Security, and she’s faced a complaint over where she actually lives and votes. Add up her votes and you get a pattern: she protects the GOP party agenda and special interests over Iowa families. 

### former doctor miller-meeks voted for devastating health care cuts

-   Miller-Meeks betrayed Iowans and her former patients by [voting](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that is estimated to kick [17 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including nearly [12 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) who rely on Medicaid. An estimated [24,696](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) Iowans could lose their health insurance as a result of her vote. 
-   Miller-Meeks has [spent](https://www.press-citizen.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/09/25/iowa-2nd-district-congress-rita-hart-mariannette-miller-meeks-debate-obamacare-covid-19/3527145001/) [a decade](https://x.com/millermeeks/status/573358142848802819) railing against the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and claimed she ran for congress [because](https://www.ama-assn.org/member-groups-sections/senior-physicians-section-sps/sps-profile-rep-mariannette-miller-meeks-md) of its “failures.” The drop in Iowans who were uninsured was [largely attributed](https://www.axios.com/local/des-moines/2024/08/19/uninsured-iowa-medicaid-obamacare-rate) to the expansion of public insurance plans and the ACA. An estimated [136,000 Iowans](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/marketplace-enrollment/?activeTab=map&currentTimeframe=0&selectedDistributions=number-of-individuals-who-selected-a-marketplace-plan&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) were enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans. 

**Message:** Miller-Meeks betrayed Iowans and her former patients by voting to take health care away from Iowans all to fund billionaire tax breaks. 

### miller-meeks was in the pocket of big pharma

Miller-Meek was cozy with Big Pharma despite her [claims](https://www.newtondailynews.com/opinion/column/2025/03/28/lowering-prescription-drug-prices-for-iowans/) that she was working to lower the cost of prescription drugs. 

-   Miller-Meeks [opposed](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payers/lawmakers-discuss-bringing-down-prescription-drug-prices-and-incentivizing-drug-innovation) allowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors. She sided with Big Pharma and [voted against](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll420.xml) the Inflation Reduction Act, which allowed the government to negotiate lower prescription drug costs for Medicare recipients. 
-   Miller-Meeks [accepted](https://cbs2iowa.com/news/local/special-interest-money-dominates-iowas-us-house-races-favoring-republicans) a $1,000 donation from insulin manufacturer Eli Lilly the [same day](https://iowastartingline.com/2024/08/09/miller-meeks-pharma/) she voted against a bill that capped the price of insulin for seniors. 
-   According to OpenSecrets, over the course of her congressional career, Miller-Meeks had accepted more than $347,000 in campaign contributions from the [pharmaceutical/health industry](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/mariannette-miller-meeks/industries?cid=N00029495&cycle=CAREER&type=I) and [pharmaceutical manufacturing industry](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary?code=H4300&cycle=All&ind=H4300&mem=Y&recipdetail=H&t0-search=miller-mee).

**Message:** Miller-Meeks sided with big pharma over cheaper prescription drug costs for Iowans. 

### MILLER-MEEKS VOTED FOR MASSIVE CUTS TO MEDICARE

- Miller-Meeks [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml) for a bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would trigger [nearly $500 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare absent future congressional action.

**Message**: Miller-Meeks voted to make massive cuts to health care services seniors rely on all to give tax breaks to billionaires.

### mountain dew miller-meeks voted to TAKE FOOD ASSISTANCE FROM iowans

-   Miller-Meeks [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that made the [largest SNAP cut in history](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-senate-republican-leaderships-reconciliation-bill-takes). She defending her vote for the bill, by calling it a [“once-in-a-generation victory.”](https://millermeeks.house.gov/media/press-releases/one-big-beautiful-bill-passes-house-headed-president-trumps-desk) More than [28,000 Iowans](https://www.fns.usda.gov/data-research/data-visualization/snap-community-characteristics-congressional-district-dashboard) in her district rely on SNAP to afford groceries. 
-   In [2013](https://www.iowahungersummit.org/en/about_the_iowa_hunger_summit/previous_iowa_hunger_summit_events/20102019/2013_iowa_hunger_summit/), while she was serving as Iowa’s top public health official, Miller-Meeks made [disparaging comments](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2014/01/09/miller-meeks-food-stamp-line-wasnt-political/4386037/) about Iowans who relied on food stamps, claiming without evidence that the number one item they purchased was Mountain Dew. A few months later, Miller-Meeks [admitted](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2014/01/09/state-health-chief-comments-on-abrupt-resignation/4389467/) Iowa did not keep track of the type of food Iowans bought with food stamps. She then [resigned](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2014/01/09/state-health-chief-comments-on-abrupt-resignation/4389467/), but claimed that was unrelated to her false statements. 

**Message:** Miller-Meeks touted her vote to take food assistance from Iowans as a “once-in-a-generation victory.” 

### **MILLER-MEEKS WAS THE DECIDING VOTE TO PROTECT TRUMP’S TARIFFS**

-   Miller-Meeks [defended](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6368593360112) Trump’s tariffs even though an Iowa economist warned [“we’re all going to be poorer.”](https://www.thegazette.com/article/iowa-state-economist-on-trump-tariff-policies-were-all-going-to-be-poorer/) She voted four times to protect the tariffs, including in April 2025 when she was the deciding vote to protect tariffs from being repealed by Congress, dooming Iowans who relied on her to a [trade war](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/business/soy-farmers-struggle-with-trade-war.html) and rising prices. Tariffs are contributing to [higher food prices](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi), [higher costs for researchers](https://www.kcrg.com/2025/05/10/university-iowa-engineering-students-learn-firsthand-about-impacts-tariffs/), and were [hurting Iowa farmers](https://www.iasoybeans.com/newsroom/article/us-soybean-farmers-sound-alarm-as-china-turns-to-brazil-amid-trade-standoff). 
-   As a result of Trump’s trade war, China had [stopped buying Americans soybeans](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/business/china-us-soybeans-farming.html) and instead [started buying them from Brazil](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-misses-out-billions-dollars-china-soybean-sales-midway-through-peak-season-2025-09-10/). China had previously been the [biggest buyer](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/the-american-farmers-china-is-using-as-a-trade-war-bargaining-chip-134c2cda?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAim6K_ctW7ArWM9H6fc_WMa3BuzkmnO1jk_Gc3V0CbMeWyyd1kdeiVJGKHZ73M%3D&gaa_ts=68cc4400&gaa_sig=a7zuiQ_nXRNWx5AM9EsmgKrpRrZEa7Quu2sP9yd5RR5WSyKuJld_wSYsuOip6gkZwbwixDT4bJjsGn-_hMlecQ%3D%3D) of American soybeans. 

**Message:** Higher prices, crops sitting in storage, lost income for farmers – Miller-Meeks chose Trump’s trade war over protecting affordability and Iowans’ livelihoods.

### **MILLER-MEEKS DEFENDED ATTACKS ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND IOWA MEDICAL RESEARCH** 

-   Miller-Meeks defended the “Department of Government Efficiency,” even [joining](https://www.kcci.com/article/mariannette-miller-meeks-joins-new-department-government-efficiency-caucus/63414615) the congressional DOGE caucus. She suggested federal government changes were only [“a little bit of disruption”](https://www.radioiowa.com/2025/04/14/miller-meeks-says-gop-has-more-to-do-in-d-c-and-des-moines/) even though DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) [ability](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/) to [deliver services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. More than 178,000 Iowans in Miller-Meeks’ district relied on Social Security benefits. 
-   Miller-Meeks [defended](https://heartlandsignal.com/2025/02/21/mariannette-miller-meeks-defends-nih-cuts-which-could-slash-university-of-iowa-research-she-previously-supported/) the Trump administration’s cuts even though they proposed cuts to National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding that could be devastating the research conducted by the University of Iowa – research that Miller-Meeks has repeatedly touted in the past. NIH funding [supported](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/02/12/u-iowa-briefly-halts-new-research-amid-nih-chaos) thousands of jobs and hundreds of businesses in Iowa. 

**Message:** Miller-Meeks claimed cuts that were destroying Iowa medical research funding and seniors’ access to the Social Security Administration were just “a little bit of disruption.” 

### miller-meeks voted against protecting iowans’ clean energy jobs 

-   Miller-Meeks, who has previously [expressed](https://x.com/millermeeks/status/678607401491140608) climate skepticism, voted against protecting Iowans’ clean energy jobs. Miller-Meeks [signed](https://garbarino.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/garbarino.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025.03.09-tax-credits-letter.pdf) [letters](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4815990-mike-johnson-ira-clean-energy-tax-credits/) urging the Republican leadership not to repeal clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, then [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) to [repeal](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-passes-senate-megabill-trump-ira-tax-credit/752276/) those credits and make them harder to access, threatening [hundreds](https://underthreat.seia.org/threat/#jobs) of clean energy jobs in her state.

 **Message:** Miller-Meeks broke her promises and voted against protecting Iowans' clean energy jobs to give tax breaks to billionaires. 

### It Took miller-meeks 11 months to vote to release the epstein files and he did only after trump gave permission

-   In November 2025, after 11 months, Miller-Meeks finally [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml) to release the Epstein files, but only after [Donald Trump gave House Republicans permission](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115562626931599548) to do so. Previously, Miller-Meeks had [cast the deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml) against [releasing the Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj), protecting the accused pedophiles named within them. Miller-Meeks never [signed](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209) the discharge petition that called for their release and she never [co-sponsored](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581/cosponsors?pageSort=alphaByParty) Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna’s resolution calling for their release. 

**Message:** Miller-Meeks can’t be trusted to hold accused pedophiles named in the Epstein files accountable, he’ll fall in line with whatever Trump wants him to do. 

### **MILLER-MEEKS WAS ACCUSED OF VIOLATING IOWA ELECTION LAW**

Miller-Meeks faced an ethics complaint over where her primary address was actually located.

-   Following redistricting, in 2022, Miller-Meeks [_changed her voter registration_](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/22/mariannette-miller-meeks-responds-to-ethics-complaint-about-voting-address/75204526007/) from her known home in Ottumwa to Le Claire which was in the 1^st^ congressional district. The address belonged to Republican State Senator Chris Cournoyer. She used that address to vote in the 2022 general election.
-   Leading up to the 2024 election, Miller-Meeks [_changed her voter registration_](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/22/mariannette-miller-meeks-responds-to-ethics-complaint-about-voting-address/75204526007/) to an apartment in Davenport. The Davenport apartment building was [_partially managed_](https://www.thegazette.com/campaigns-elections/u-s-rep-mariannette-miller-meeks-davenport-apartment-linked-to-donor/) by a group affiliated with David Barker, who served on the Iowa Board of Regents and had donated $52,900 in support of Miller-Meeks’ campaigns throughout the years. Barker claimed he was unaware Miller-Meeks was living there.
-   It was [_reported_](https://www.kcrg.com/2024/09/24/ethics-complaint-alleges-rep-miller-meeks-voting-davenport-despite-living-ottumwa/) that Miller-Meeks used her Ottumwa address on official government forms. In October 2024 it was also [_reported_](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/22/mariannette-miller-meeks-responds-to-ethics-complaint-about-voting-address/75204526007/) that she collected a homestead tax credit at that home during the previous two tax periods. She also reported on her [_2023_](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2023/10061002.pdf) and [_2024_](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2024/10067915.pdf) personal financial disclosures that she owed a mortgage on a personal residence in Ottumwa.
-   Iowa state law [_required_](https://www.thegazette.com/campaigns-elections/u-s-rep-mariannette-miller-meeks-davenport-apartment-linked-to-donor/) voters to register to vote at their primary address and vote in the county where they primarily resided. Bleeding Heartland [_reported_](https://www.bleedingheartland.com/2022/12/16/unlike-whitver-miller-meeks-put-herself-in-legal-jeopardy/) that Miller-Meeks’ actions could have put her at risk for election misconduct or perjury, which were both Class ‘D’ felonies in Iowa.

**Message:** Miller-Meeks doesn’t think the rules apply to her.   
 

### **Hospitals at risk in IA-01**

[_All hospitals in the district are included in this map; Green hospitals are at risk; Black have been shut down_](https://earth.google.com/web/@41.33531665,-91.62013511,216.17836601a,572547.20590901d,30.00015762y,0h,0t,0r/data=CgRCAggBMikKJwolCiExRmVzemRjVzVIcjNuMmw3WnNNQnQ0TVBld3hIb0R1SVggAUICCABKBwjfpsYkEAE?authuser=0)
