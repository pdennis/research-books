# Education Policy and Broader Issues

### Summary

-   Hurd's criticism of federal education policy aligns him with Trump's approach, which could alienate moderate or pro-federal education voters (Source: [Denver Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FCS-9383-RRH8-W44J-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Emphasis on congressional authority over the Department of Education may frustrate constituents seeking immediate executive action or fast changes (Source: [Coloradopolitics.com](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FCS-9383-RRH8-W3Y3-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Pushing for legislative-only education reforms could be perceived as slow-moving or overly bureaucratic, possibly disappointing voters eager for swift policy shifts (Source: [Denver Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FCS-9383-RRH8-W44J-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Strong advocacy for local control and reduction of federal involvement risks alienating those who support federal oversight or depend on federal education programs, particularly in under-resourced communities (Source: [Coloradopolitics.com](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FCS-9383-RRH8-W3Y3-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   References to protecting rural education programs, while positive, may not address concerns from constituents in urban or suburban parts of the district, potentially creating perception of regional favoritism (Source: [Denver Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FCS-9383-RRH8-W44J-00000-00&context=1519360))

### Federal vs. State Control of Education

#### Position on Local vs. Federal Oversight

**March 2025: Jeff Hurd Shared Concerns About Federal Education Policy Failures** According to The Denver Gazette, U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, a Grand Junction Republican first elected in November, say in a statement to Colorado Politics that he shares Trump's concerns 'about the failures of federal education policy,' adding that he believes Washington's 'top-down control burdens schools, undermines parental authority and ails students.' \[Denver Gazette, [3/20/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FCS-9383-RRH8-W44J-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**March 2025: Jeff Hurd Noted Only Congress Can Eliminate Federal Agencies** According to The Denver Gazette, 'Alone among the state's Republicans, however, Hurd noted that it's up to Congress to shut down the department.' 'At the same time, the Constitution is clear: Congress creates federal agencies, and only Congress can eliminate them. The President's executive order directs the Secretary of Education to take steps toward closure but it cannot, by itself, abolish the department. That requires an act of Congress,' Hurd said. \[Denver Gazette, [3/20/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FCS-9383-RRH8-W44J-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**March 2025: Jeff Hurd Committed To Legislative Process For Education Reform** According to The Denver Gazette, Hurd said, 'If we are serious about fundamentally restructuring the Department and returning power and resources to local school districts, we must do it through legislation that ensures a stable transition and protects critical programs, especially in rural communities like Colorado's 3rd District. I will work with my colleagues to advance real reforms that stop federal overreach, empower local decision-making, and put students and families first.' \[Denver Gazette, [3/20/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FCS-9383-RRH8-W44J-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
