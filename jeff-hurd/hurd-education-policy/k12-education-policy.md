# K-12 Education Policy

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd's repeated criticism of federal education policy and emphasis on parental authority may alienate constituents who favor more robust federal support or oversight for schools ([Coloradopolitics.com](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FCS-9383-RRH8-W3Y3-00000-00&context=1519360); [Denver Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPH-3KV3-SCNV-T051-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Advocacy from local activists like Jennifer McGavin suggests there is public concern about potential cuts to education funding, creating pressure on Hurd to defend or clarify his position ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FHM-7TB3-S9PX-J44P-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd's alignment with Trump's stance on federal education failures could become a vulnerability if district voters disagree with Trump-era education policies ([Coloradopolitics.com](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FCS-9383-RRH8-W3Y3-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The allocation and perceived adequacy of Secure Rural Schools funds remain a local concern, and any support for reducing or altering these funds could be seen as harming rural education ([The Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FDK-B8P3-RY8V-240S-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Repeated statements emphasizing the burdens of "top-down" federal control could be used by opponents to portray Hurd as unsupportive of traditional federal education priorities or funding mechanisms ([Denver Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPH-3KV3-SCNV-T051-00000-00&context=1519360)).
