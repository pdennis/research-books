# Immigration Reform and Legislative Actions

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd advocated for increased legal immigration and expanding visa programs to help address workforce shortages ([Journal, The](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D2V-J1H1-DXVP-T3M9-00000-00&context=1519360), [Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F32-4C63-RS20-B1WD-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd proposed an employer-tied work visa system, sometimes referred to as the "red card" program, to allow non-citizens to work legally in the U.S. without a pathway to citizenship ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D81-4DP1-DXVP-T229-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He supported targeted deportations focusing on undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes, while supporting a legal avenue for nonviolent undocumented workers to remain without citizenship status ([Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D60-KM21-DXVP-T548-00000-00&context=1519360)).
