# Border Security and Enforcement

### Summary

-   Hurd repeatedly emphasized border security as his top legislative priority, which could open him to criticism if progress is slow or results remain unclear ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C93-GM51-JBCN-31VP-00000-00&context=1519360), [Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DC6-1B21-DXVP-T0JT-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He supported completing the southern border wall but conditioned support to "where possible," potentially attracting criticism from hardliners expecting full border wall completion ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D81-4DP1-DXVP-T229-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He signaled support for deporting violent criminals but withheld judgment on broader Trump immigration plans, which could alienate voters seeking stronger or clearer stances ([Colorado Newsline](https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/12/27/jeff-hurd-boeberts-new-style/), [The Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F13-35M3-RW41-H0R5-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd criticized Colorado's restrictions on ICE coordination, but his ability to influence state-level policies is limited, highlighting a gap between rhetoric and practical impact ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F32-4C63-RS20-B1WD-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He claimed improvement and "success" in securing the border while still facing ongoing issues of drug (fentanyl) smuggling through legal ports of entry, which could be interpreted as an overstatement or exposed by future incidents ([CPR News](https://www.cpr.org/2024/06/03/vg-2024-colorado-primary-elections-congressional-district-3-candidate-jeff-hurd/), [The Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMS-GJT3-RSMT-0323-00000-00&context=1519360)).
