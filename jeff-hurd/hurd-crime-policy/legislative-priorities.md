# Legislative Priorities and Policy Approach

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd prioritized tackling fentanyl and crime within Colorado's 3rd Congressional District as a central legislative focus ([Durango Herald, 9/19/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D10-2YN1-DXVP-T4RP-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   His border policy positions closely align with those of Adam Frisch, but Hurd has emphasized criminal justice and public safety issues specific to the district ([Durango Herald, 9/19/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D10-2YN1-DXVP-T4RP-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd opposed pardons for January 6 protesters who participated in violence or assaulted law enforcement, setting him apart from most Republicans ([Montrose Daily Press, 2/8/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F32-4C63-RS20-B1WD-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He cited respect for law enforcement as a core reason for opposing these pardons, describing it as a fundamental principle guiding his decisions ([Montrose Daily Press, 2/8/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F32-4C63-RS20-B1WD-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd's stance on January 6 pardons, while principled, may create vulnerabilities with segments of the Republican base who favored broader pardons.
