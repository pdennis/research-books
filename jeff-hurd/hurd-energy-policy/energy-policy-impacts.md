# Economic, Local, and National Impacts of Energy Policy

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd has publicly emphasized the importance of defending the Western Slope's economy and culture, highlighting local concerns about energy policy impacts ([Denver Gazette Editorial Board, 12/31/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B0T-4J91-DXVP-T1FN-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd contends that state and federal Democratic energy policies have created a "hidden tax" on low- and middle-income residents, particularly impacting rural communities reliant on affordable energy ([Montrose Daily Press, 10/23/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D81-4DP1-DXVP-T229-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He links domestic energy production to national security, suggesting that energy independence is vital for the country's strategic interests ([Denver Post, 10/24/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D86-8461-DXVP-T4W1-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   There is a clear focus on the adverse local effects of broader energy policies, especially for Western Slope and other rural Colorado communities.

-   A potential vulnerability is that framing energy policy debate strictly in terms of local or partisan interests may overlook broader environmental and economic considerations.
