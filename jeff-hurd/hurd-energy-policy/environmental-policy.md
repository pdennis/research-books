# Environmental Policy and Legislative Actions

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd has consistently advocated for relocating the BLM headquarters to Grand Junction to increase decision-maker proximity to federal lands and local stakeholders, emphasizing improved land management and accountability ([Grand Junction Daily Sentinel](https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/hurd-bill-would-move-blm-hq-to-grand-junction/article_1a70b400-ea35-11ef-ad73-9b750b037825.html); [Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FB0-78J3-RSJ6-V4YW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He has introduced and supported multiple bills restricting the president's authority to designate national monuments unilaterally, preferring a Congressional and locally driven process for federal land use decisions ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FCB-V1J3-RT07-C467-00000-00&context=1519360); [Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FB0-78J3-RSJ6-V4YW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd has pushed for reforms to federal regulations like NEPA and the Endangered Species Act, supporting legislation (such as the Fix Our Forests Act and HR-471) intended to streamline land management, enhance wildfire mitigation, and enable responsible forestry and resource development ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F6N-MJN3-RS1T-153J-00000-00&context=1519360); [Delta County Independent](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F2K-C1V3-RT38-40BT-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He emphasizes balancing environmental conservation with economic development, including supporting responsible mining, multiple-use land policies (for agriculture, energy, and recreation), and opposing blanket land protections that bypass local input ([Steamboat Pilot & Today](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DGJ-XGP1-JBCN-32DY-00000-00&context=1519360); [Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMT-TD63-RSVX-V3FP-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd has sought to overturn several Biden-era public land conservation rules and resource management plans, instead advocating for "multiple use" and stakeholder-driven policies ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMT-TD63-RSVX-V3FP-00000-00&context=1519360); [The Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMS-GJT3-RSMT-0323-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerability: Hurd's legislative actions and rhetoric have drawn criticism from conservation groups and some local constituents, who argue his approach favors deregulation and corporate interests over environmental protection and community needs ([Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F9V-6NX3-S0N9-K4WD-00000-00&context=1519360); [Post Independent](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FNN-8TF3-S4RN-F1N0-00000-00&context=1519360)).
