# Energy Infrastructure and Resource Management

### Summary

-   Rep. Jeff Hurd led efforts to permanently move the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado, arguing it would improve agency responsiveness to Western land and resource issues ([CPR News](https://www.cpr.org/2025/02/27/interview-gop-rep-jeff-hurd-speaks-on-doge-medicaid-and-nazi-salutes/); [The Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMS-GJT3-RSMT-0323-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd introduced the Productive Public Lands Act, which aims to overturn recent BLM policies and Resource Management Plans (RMPs) that he says limit oil, gas, and other land uses, claiming this would help restore U.S. energy dominance ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FFM-2373-RXTY-G41H-00000-00&context=1519360); [Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FFP-H063-RS61-22B3-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He has prioritized water infrastructure investment, specifically supporting funding requests for projects like the Norwood water system and highlighting the importance of government involvement in such initiatives ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F7R-GH73-RS07-1178-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd expressed skepticism toward large-scale public land sell-offs, stating they are not generally beneficial, but has not categorically ruled out limited, case-specific land sales ([The Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FNN-P6V3-RTT4-X35N-00000-00&context=1519360); [Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FN1-SVJ3-RSD6-V0KR-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerability: Hurd's focus on dismantling conservation-focused BLM policies and promoting resource extraction could draw criticism from environmental groups concerned about wildlife protection and long-term land stewardship ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FFM-2373-RXTY-G41H-00000-00&context=1519360)).

A reissuance of these RMPs will put us on a path to energy dominance allowing for a more secure and prosperous United States,' Hurd's statement read." \[Montrose Daily Press, [3/29/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FFM-2373-RXTY-G41H-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
