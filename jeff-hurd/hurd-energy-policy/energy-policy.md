# Energy Policy Positions

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd strongly advocates for an "all-of-the-above" energy strategy, supporting the development of fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewable energy to promote energy independence, economic growth, and job security in Colorado ([Durango Herald](https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/u-s-rep-jeff-hurd-talks-doge-energy-policy-ukraine-in-first-tele-town-hall/), [Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D86-8461-DXVP-T4W1-00000-00&context=1519360)).
