# Livestock and Animal Husbandry Policy

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd urged the livestock community to reach consensus on two major wolf-related issues: conducting a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) study and taking a stance on delisting wolves from the endangered species list ([The Journal, 2/10/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F3M-R9B3-RRPM-G489-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd voiced support for Rep. Lauren Boebert's bill, which aims to remove wolves from the federal endangered species list---often referred to as "delisting" ([The Journal, 2/10/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F3M-R9B3-RRPM-G489-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   During a livestock meeting, Hurd was represented by his Southwest Regional Director, Naomi Dobbs, who updated attendees on his positions ([The Journal, 2/10/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F3M-R9B3-RRPM-G489-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Dobbs relayed Hurd's request for a unified stance among the livestock community regarding both a NEPA study and delisting, emphasizing the need for a collective voice ([The Journal, 2/10/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F3M-R9B3-RRPM-G489-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   A potential vulnerability exists if the livestock community remains divided on these issues, potentially weakening advocacy efforts on NEPA studies or wolf delisting.
