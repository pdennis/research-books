# Political Framing and Campaign Strategy on Abortion and Family Issues

### Summary

-   Frisch's reliance on abortion as a core campaign strategy may not resonate with the district's voters, who appear to prioritize other issues ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CY8-9N91-JBCN-34J3-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd frames Frisch's focus on abortion as evidence of being out-of-touch with local concerns, potentially undermining Frisch's appeal ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CY8-9N91-JBCN-34J3-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd's pragmatic, less showy campaign approach could make it difficult for Frisch to gain traction with voters looking for substance over spectacle ([Journal, The](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CMR-GHG1-DXVP-T1NM-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   By redirecting abortion debates to topics like energy policy and the local economy, Hurd effectively shifts attention to issues where he perceives stronger voter interest ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D3R-PGC1-JBCN-311G-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Frisch risks being portrayed as "out of step" with district sentiment, weakening his campaign's local authenticity and relevance ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CY8-9N91-JBCN-34J3-00000-00&context=1519360)).

### Emphasizing Pragmatism and Problem-Solving

**2024: Jeff Hurd Described His Campaign Approach As Pragmatic Over Showmanship** According to Journal, The, Frisch is "turning to abortion to try to win in November against Republican Jeff Hurd, a mild-mannered Grand Junction attorney who is a first-time candidate preaching pragmatism over showmanship." \[Journal, The (Cortez, Dolores, Mancos, CO), [7/16/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CMR-GHG1-DXVP-T1NM-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Handling of Attacks and Media Coverage

#### Responses to Opponent's Ads on Abortion

**2024: Jeff Hurd Asserted Abortion Would Not Be A Winning Issue For His Opponent** According to Montrose Daily Press, "Hurd said he doesn't think abortion will be a winning issue for Frisch and that Frisch's focus on the issue is a sign that he doesn't know the district." \[Montrose Daily Press, [7/16/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CY8-9N91-JBCN-34J3-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Approach Toward Bipartisan and Moderate Voters

#### Engagement With Voters Across the Political Spectrum

**2024: Jeff Hurd Characterized District Voters As Less Focused On Abortion** According to Montrose Daily Press, "'It just doesn't seem to me consistent with what the voters in this district have told me that they care about,' he said. 'And, if anything, I think he's out of step with where most voters are in the district on this issue.'" \[Montrose Daily Press, [7/16/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CY8-9N91-JBCN-34J3-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Downplaying Social Issues in Favor of Economic Concerns

**October 2024: Hurd Shifted Abortion Debate To Energy Policy During Debate** According to Durango Herald, "When called out on abortion, Hurd shifted the conversation to discuss energy policy, specifically the shutdown of Comanche Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant in Pueblo. He said the shutdown will hurt families because it affects the local economy and taxes." \[Durango Herald (Colorado), [10/2/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D3R-PGC1-JBCN-311G-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
