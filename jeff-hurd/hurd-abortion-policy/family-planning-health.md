# Positions on Family Planning and Women's Health

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd publicly supports access to both contraception and in vitro fertilization (IVF), according to multiple news sources ([The Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CMR-GHG1-DXVP-T1NM-00000-00&context=1519360), [Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CRM-KP01-DXVP-T4DH-00000-00&context=1519360), [Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CY8-9N91-JBCN-34J3-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd's campaign highlighted his personal connection to IVF, noting that he has friends and colleagues who have benefited from the procedure.

-   He has stated he would not support any federal efforts to restrict or limit access to IVF treatments.

-   These statements signal a commitment to maintaining reproductive options for women and families.

-   No evidence exists in these reports of Hurd endorsing restrictions on contraception or IVF, suggesting strong support for family planning access.

-   Potential vulnerability: Statements are as of July 2024 and are based on campaign spokesperson comments; positions could be subject to future clarification or policy shifts.
