# Stances on Abortion

### Summary

-   Hurd consistently describes himself as "pro-life with exceptions" (rape, incest, and life of the mother), which may alienate both strict anti-abortion advocates and voters who favor broader abortion access ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CRM-KP01-DXVP-T4DH-00000-00&context=1519360); [Pueblo Chieftain](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D3G-K0N1-DXGX-63D9-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He opposes a federal abortion ban and federal codification of Roe v. Wade, insisting abortion policy should be handled at the state level, which could make him vulnerable to attacks from both national pro-life and pro-choice groups ([Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5V-K881-JBCN-31C1-00000-00&context=1519360); [Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CY8-9N91-JBCN-34J3-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He has refused to clarify his stance on specific state ballot measures (e.g., Amendment 79), which could be perceived as evasiveness or lack of transparency ([Colorado Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D1Y-59W1-JBCN-315S-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd's call for a "mainstream approach" and lack of specific policy details (such as a clear gestational limit) might be seen as vague or non-committal by both sides of the abortion debate ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CRM-KP01-DXVP-T4DH-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   His criticism of his opponent's focus on abortion may give the impression he underestimates the importance of the issue for some district voters, risking perceptions of being out of touch ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CRM-KP01-DXVP-T4DH-00000-00&context=1519360)).
