# Relationships with Advocacy Groups, Coalitions, and Legislation Partners

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd received the endorsement of Americans for Prosperity Action, a major conservative advocacy group that has previously opposed Donald Trump in primaries ([Coloradopolitics.com, 5/23/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C3K-2RC1-JBCN-34MH-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   In January 2025, Hurd met with the Ute Mountain Ute Tribal Council to discuss water issues, healthcare access, and law enforcement resources on tribal lands ([The Journal, 1/31/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F1H-1GR3-RWPR-738F-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd also engaged with the Southern Ute Tribal Council about the impact of presidential orders, particularly those from Donald Trump, on tribal sovereignty and community well-being ([The Journal, 1/31/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F1H-1GR3-RWPR-738F-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Additional discussions with the Southern Ute Tribal Council focused on water rights, federal tribal programs, and collaborative approaches to energy development and sustainability ([The Journal, 1/31/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F1H-1GR3-RWPR-738F-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd's relationship with Americans for Prosperity Action could be seen as a vulnerability among voters who are skeptical of outside group influence or who supported Trump, given the organization's past spending against him.
