# Relationships with Constituents and Community Groups

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd prioritized building relationships with local officials and community groups, receiving endorsements from numerous county commissioners, city council members, and state legislators across diverse regions, including Pueblo, Montrose, and Delta Counties ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69Y0-5G11-DXVP-T4HX-00000-00&context=1519360); [Coloradopolitics.com](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D9P-5MR1-JBCN-3177-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd emphasized regular direct engagement with constituents and local governments, favoring small meetings with county commissioners and community stakeholders over large town halls, and conducted district-wide listening tours ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FN1-SVJ3-RSD6-V0KR-00000-00&context=1519360); [Aspen Journalism](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPR-2SP3-SHB3-Y0PC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd maintained open lines of communication with officials regardless of political affiliation, with Democratic-leaning counties noting they felt "very heard," a contrast to previous representation ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FGB-DH13-RVWP-N2H1-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerabilities include periodic staff or personal no-shows at scheduled county meetings, limited availability in some parts of the large district, and some criticism of using telephone town halls instead of more frequent in-person forums ([Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FDK-B8P3-RY8V-240S-00000-00&context=1519360); [Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FF8-JN43-S6BM-12DM-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd has stated that he intends to represent all constituents regardless of political support and has promised improved media accessibility and responsiveness to community concerns ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FN1-SVJ3-RSD6-V0KR-00000-00&context=1519360); [Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DCS-90W1-JBCN-31NH-00000-00&context=1519360)).
