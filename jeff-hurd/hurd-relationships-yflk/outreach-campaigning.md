# Outreach and Campaigning Approach

### Summary

-   Limited in-person engagement: Some events, like the Bayfield meet-and-greet, drew only 15-20 participants, possibly indicating modest turnout or limited reach among constituents ([Journal, The - Cortez, Dolores, Mancos, CO](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BX1-1031-DXVP-T459-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Reliance on virtual events: High participation in virtual town halls is positive, but letters to the editor have requested more live, in-person events, suggesting there may be a perceived lack of accessibility or personal connection ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FDD-NWD3-RX3G-C526-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Need to demonstrate outreach across political lines: While Hurd has stated his intention to engage constituents regardless of their political affiliation, it remains an open question whether this approach is being realized in practice ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DS3-BNF3-RRTG-J1T8-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Perception of selective expertise: Positive feedback on Hurd's authenticity is counterbalanced by acknowledgement that he does not always possess deep knowledge on every topic, which could be a vulnerability if opponents question his preparedness ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69JM-Y6V1-JBCN-34T1-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential gaps in outreach strategy: The combination of small in-person events, requests for increased face-to-face interaction, and questions about effectiveness in engaging all constituents may indicate room for improvement in outreach and inclusivity.
