# Relationships with Constituents and Community Groups

### Summary

-   Rep. Jeff Hurd prioritized small-group meetings with county commissioners and community groups over traditional in-person town halls since taking office ([The Journal, 4/23/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FNN-P6V3-RTT4-X35N-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd has yet to hold a formal in-person town hall, intentionally preferring formats that promote two-way dialogue and avoid shouting matches ([The Journal, 4/23/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FNN-P6V3-RTT4-X35N-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He was observed engaging personally with constituents, including those participating in protests, and was praised for his approachable manner and ability to remember details about individuals' concerns ([The Journal, 4/23/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FNN-P6V3-RTT4-X35N-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   According to staff, Hurd routinely takes questions from the public at numerous meetings across his district and does not shy away from difficult or challenging topics ([The Journal, 4/23/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FNN-P6V3-RTT4-X35N-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerability: Hurd's reluctance to hold traditional town halls could be perceived as avoidance or lack of transparency with constituents.
