# Preparedness and Prevention Policy Stance

### Summary

-   Hurd's bipartisan call to reinstate Forest Service workers highlights underlying staffing shortages and could invite criticism if rapid progress isn't seen ([Aspen Journalism](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPR-2SP3-SHB3-Y0PC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Repeated emphasis on the need for more on-the-ground staffing signals possible longstanding neglect or ineffectiveness in existing management and resource allocation ([Aspen Journalism](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPR-2SP3-SHB3-Y0PC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Public concerns about recent field staff layoffs at White River National Forest showcase vulnerability to criticism that Hurd's district isn't being adequately protected against wildfire risks ([Aspen Journalism](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPR-2SP3-SHB3-Y0PC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   If wildfire incidents increase or management appears lacking during summer, Hurd's policy advocacy could face scrutiny for not driving timely, effective solutions ([Aspen Journalism](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPR-2SP3-SHB3-Y0PC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

### Federal and State Coordination

#### Support for Bipartisan Solutions

**April 2025: Jeff Hurd Joined Bipartisan Congressional Letter Urging Reinstatement Of Forest Service Workers** According to Aspen Journalism, "Rep. Jeff Hurd, a Republican from Grand Junction representing Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, joined all of Colorado's Democratic representatives in Congress in sending a letter dated April 29 to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins asking her to reinstate Forest Service workers who are qualified to respond to wildfires." \[Aspen Journalism, [5/2/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPR-2SP3-SHB3-Y0PC-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Resource Allocation and Infrastructure

#### Prioritization of Local Infrastructure

**May 2025: Jeff Hurd Advocated For Increased On-The-Ground Forest Management Staffing** According to Aspen Journalism, "'We need more boots on the ground,' Hurd said in a phone interview Wednesday. 'We need more individuals that are managing our forests, managing our public lands, reducing the fire load in our national forests, protecting watershed health, because, remember, forest health also means watershed health.'" \[Aspen Journalism, [5/2/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPR-2SP3-SHB3-Y0PC-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

#### Advocacy for Adequate Funding

**May 2025: Jeff Hurd Expressed Concern Over Field Staff Layoffs At White River National Forest** According to Aspen Journalism, "Hurd said he has spoken with those in leadership roles at the White River National Forest and understands that recent cuts were to those working in the field. 'That's something that we need to make sure we address as quickly as possible, particularly given the potential fire risk that we may have coming this summer,' he said." \[Aspen Journalism, [5/2/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPR-2SP3-SHB3-Y0PC-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
