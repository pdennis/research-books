# Funding, Oversight, and Accountability

### Federal Spending and Program Management

#### Support for Federal Spending Cuts or Increases

**May 2025: Jeff Hurd Supported Targeted Cuts That Avoid Reducing Ground Staff** According to Aspen Journalism, "Hurd said he is in favor of working to identify areas across the government, including the federal land management agencies, that can work more efficiently. But he emphasized that those cuts should not affect people working on the ground to protect resources. \[...\] 'We're doing everything we can to make sure that our public-lands agencies have the resources they need in the places that they need them and that when we're making cuts, we're making them in places that aren't going to result in harm to our public forest, to our national forest and our public lands,' Hurd said." \[Aspen Journalism, [5/2/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPR-2SP3-SHB3-Y0PC-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
