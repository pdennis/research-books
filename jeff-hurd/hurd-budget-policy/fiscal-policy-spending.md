-   Hurd called for responsible and targeted budget cuts, warning against indiscriminate reductions that could threaten essential local services or frontline positions, and advocated for spending oversight and accountability ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F79-J5X3-RV2G-N1G0-00000-00&context=1519360); [Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMT-TD63-RSVX-V3FP-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He expressed strong views that the federal government is "too big," regularly voicing support for reducing the size of the federal workforce---particularly in Washington, D.C., rather than local land management or frontline roles ([Aspen Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FJ4-WDC3-RRX6-53PJ-00000-00&context=1519360); [The Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FB6-H7R3-RSFV-F31R-00000-00&context=1519360)).
