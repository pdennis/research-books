# Approach to Bipartisanship and Governance

### Summary

-   Hurd's emphasis on bipartisanship may alienate more hardline partisans in his district who expect a stronger stance against the opposing party ([Denver Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D21-FMW1-DXVP-T4WT-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Focusing on nonpartisan issues like water could be seen as avoiding tougher partisan conflicts or controversial topics ([Colorado Newsline](https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/12/27/jeff-hurd-boeberts-new-style/))

-   Labeling the House budget bill as just a "conceptual framework" may create the impression of lacking definitive positions or clear commitments ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F79-J5X3-RV2G-N1G0-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   The call for pragmatism and comprehensive review could be criticized by opponents as ambiguity or unwillingness to take bold stands ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F79-J5X3-RV2G-N1G0-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Reliance on collaboration with Democrats and bipartisan action might be used by critics to question his party loyalty or conservative credentials ([Denver Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D21-FMW1-DXVP-T4WT-00000-00&context=1519360))

### Bipartisan Legislation and Collaboration

#### Co-sponsoring bipartisan bills

**2024: Jeff Hurd Indicated Intent To Collaborate With Both Parties On Colorado Priorities, Especially Water** According to Colorado Newsline, 'I think there's an opportunity to work together as a Colorado delegation on issues that aren't partisan, but that matter to all of us as Coloradans --- first and foremost would be water and protecting that precious resource,' Hurd said. \[Colorado Newsline, [12/27/24](https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/12/27/jeff-hurd-boeberts-new-style/)\]

**2024: Jeff Hurd Advocated For Bipartisanship In Addressing District Issues** According to Denver Gazette, 'Hurd said it's critical to have bipartisan support and foolish to say it isn't necessary. He said water is an issue that politicians can unite on. "I'm not going to be successful in representing the district unless I can work with our congressional delegation" and with the Democrats at the state Capitol.' \[Denver Gazette, [9/23/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D21-FMW1-DXVP-T4WT-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Pragmatism and Political Strategy

#### Pragmatic vs partisan approach

**2025: Jeff Hurd Called The House Budget Bill A Conceptual Framework And A First Step In The Process** According to Montrose Daily Press, "'Right now, this is just a conceptual framework for advancing the agenda we all campaigned on, including securing the border, growing our energy economy, making sure that small American businesses and families receive an extension of their tax cuts from 2017, and doing what we can to make sure that regulations work for Americans and not against them, including in the 3rd Congressional District. (Tuesday) night's vote was the first step in what will be a longer process.'" \[Montrose Daily Press, [2/28/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F79-J5X3-RV2G-N1G0-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2025: Jeff Hurd Emphasized A Pragmatic Approach To Budget Legislation Affecting 3rd Congressional District** According to Montrose Daily Press, '"My evaluation of this legislation in the end will take a comprehensive and pragmatic approach. I hope my colleagues in the House and Senate will do the same thing."' \[Montrose Daily Press, [2/28/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F79-J5X3-RV2G-N1G0-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
