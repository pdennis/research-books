# Economic Policy and Poverty

### Summary

-   Hurd repeatedly emphasizes rural Colorado's economic stagnation and youth exodus, highlighting the district's struggle to retain younger generations ([Denver Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69ST-YWW1-DXVP-T1CH-00000-00&context=1519360), [Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5F-G3T1-DXVP-T4VT-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He frequently identifies economic opportunity as the central challenge but offers few specific policy details or actionable plans for job creation and economic revitalization ([Journal, The](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CBK-8K11-JBCN-33TX-00000-00&context=1519360), [Coloradopolitics.com](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0Y-KPH1-DXVP-T1MR-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd's focus on local economic issues like the high cost of living, inflation, and job scarcity may highlight gaps in his ability to address broader or national economic concerns ([Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CBK-S681-JBCN-30H1-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Critics have called out his messaging on "empowering working families" as vague, lacking clear policy proposals or tangible solutions ([Coloradopolitics.com](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0Y-KPH1-DXVP-T1MR-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   By emphasizing rural economic decline without clear solutions, Hurd risks being perceived as focused on problems rather than implementing effective change.

### Job Creation and Economic Growth

#### Backing for local job growth initiatives

**2023: Jeff Hurd Identified Economic Challenges and Youth Exodus in District 3** According to an editorial published in Denver Gazette, 'He sees the economy as the greatest challenge facing District 3 and has plans to improve it. "One of our greatest exports from western and southern Colorado is our kids," Hurd said. "They grow up and leave and don't come back because there aren't enough economic opportunities for them. I grew up here, I left, and I did come back. But a lot of my peers left and would like to come back but there aren't enough economic opportunities. Rural Colorado is at risk of being left behind. We need to bridge that urban-rural gap and be an advocate --- not just a loud advocate but a smart advocate --- for rural Colorado."' \[Editorial - Denver Gazette, [12/3/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69ST-YWW1-DXVP-T1CH-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
