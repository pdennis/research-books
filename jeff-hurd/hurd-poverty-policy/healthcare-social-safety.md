**2025: Jeff Hurd Said He Would Monitor SNAP Cuts To Ensure Vulnerable Households Are Not Harmed** According to Montrose Daily Press, '"Let's see what the Agriculture Committee comes up with when it comes to SNAP benefits. This is one of those area where I think there are some savings that could be gained in a way to better utilize some of those dollars, but we need to make sure those changes are done in a way that does not hurt those who genuinely need to use those benefits," Hurd said.' \[Montrose Daily Press, [2/28/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F79-J5X3-RV2G-N1G0-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
