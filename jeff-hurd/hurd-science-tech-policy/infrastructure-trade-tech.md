# Infrastructure, Trade, and Technology Regulation

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd expressed support for relocating the Bureau of Land Management headquarters back to Grand Junction, aligning with sentiments from local elected officials and Gov. Jared Polis ([Colorado Newsline, 12/27/24](https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/12/27/jeff-hurd-boeberts-new-style/)).

-   Hurd advocated prioritizing infrastructure funds for improving roads, bridges, and clean water systems instead of investing in passenger rail projects, which he termed "vanity trains" ([Pueblo Chieftain, 4/27/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FNM-J5F3-RXJF-731R-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He publicly opposed federal funding for the Front Range Passenger Rail project, stating his alignment with Rep. Lauren Boebert on this issue ([Pueblo Chieftain, 4/27/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FNM-J5F3-RXJF-731R-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd's approach suggests skepticism toward expanding rail infrastructure in Colorado, favoring investments that support highways, local agriculture, and tourism.

-   This stance could be seen as a vulnerability, potentially alienating constituents who support public transportation and climate-friendly infrastructure initiatives.
