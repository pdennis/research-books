# Campaign Approach and Political Philosophy

### Summary

-   Hurd distanced himself from MAGA-aligned positions by openly criticizing Trump's blanket pardons for January 6 rioters, which may alienate some Trump loyalists within the Republican base ([Steamboat Pilot & Today](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FDT-5B63-RRST-G33K-00000-00&context=1519360), [Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FFP-H063-RS61-22B3-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   His preference for party-only primaries, while respecting Proposition 108, suggests a tension between party purity and broader voter inclusion, potentially frustrating both base Republicans and independents ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6961-J951-DXVP-T4PX-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd's refusal to engage in confrontational or performative town halls could be perceived as avoiding direct accountability or limiting public debate ([Coloradopolitics.com](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FD6-7G23-RS2S-61BG-00000-00&context=1519360), [Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FN1-SVJ3-RSD6-V0KR-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Publicly asserting that he does not seek the spotlight, especially compared to his predecessor, may be seen as a lack of visibility or assertiveness at a time when constituents expect vocal advocacy ([The Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FNN-P6V3-RTT4-X35N-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd's stated willingness to support presidential orders only when within legal bounds could be interpreted as inconsistency or insufficient loyalty to executive direction, potentially disappointing more hardline partisan voters ([Colorado Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPD-TB83-RWFF-D4ST-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   His pledge to represent all constituents, even those who did not vote for him, opens him up to criticism from base voters expecting more partisan representation ([The Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FNN-P6V3-RTT4-X35N-00000-00&context=1519360)).
