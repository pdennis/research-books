# Campaign Finance, Transparency, and Accountability

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd is vulnerable to criticism for accepting significant financial support from corporate PACs and super PACs, including nearly \$700,000 from Republican groups ([Colorado Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6P-TK01-JBCN-31S5-00000-00&context=1519360), [Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D9P-5MV1-JBCN-33VR-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Opponent Adam Frisch uses Hurd's acceptance of corporate PAC money as a recurring attack, potentially undermining Hurd's credibility on campaign finance reform ([Colorado Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6P-TK01-JBCN-31S5-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd's analogy comparing PAC money criticism to food delivery may come off as dismissive and could alienate voters seeking serious answers on campaign finance ethics ([Colorado Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6P-TK01-JBCN-31S5-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   While Hurd publicly supports increased transparency and reforms such as limiting congressional stock trading and lobbying, his acceptance of large PAC and super PAC donations may create the perception of a gap between rhetoric and practice ([CPR News](https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/14/vg-2024-3rd-congressional-district-jeff-hurd/), [Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:695M-XPD1-DXVP-T200-00000-00&context=1519360)).

#### Acceptance of Super PAC and outside support

**2024: Jeff Hurd Compared Criticism Of PAC Money To Food Delivery Analogy** According to Colorado Sun, "Hurd said Frisch's criticism was like claiming he's not eating Taco Bell because he received the fast food via Uber Eats instead of directly from the restaurant." \[Colorado Sun (Denver), [10/16/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6P-TK01-JBCN-31S5-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
