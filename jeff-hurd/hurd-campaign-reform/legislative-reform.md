# Legislative Priorities and Government Reform

### Summary

-   Hurd's vocal insistence on limiting executive power and requiring congressional action on presidential policies may alienate core voters who want rapid, decisive action, especially in support of Trump's agenda ([Denver Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPH-3KV3-SCNV-T051-00000-00&context=1519360), [Coloradopolitics.com](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPH-3KV3-SCGM-H509-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   His statements criticizing Congress for "giving away all its authority to the executive branch" could be seen as indirect criticism of past Republican leadership ([The Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FNN-P6V3-RTT4-X35N-00000-00&context=1519360)), potentially exposing him to attacks from within his own party.

-   Pushing for single-issue bills over omnibus legislation aligns with good governance but may be criticized as impractical in a divided Congress, raising questions about legislative effectiveness ([CPR News](https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/14/vg-2024-3rd-congressional-district-jeff-hurd/)).

-   Hurd's support for reforms like Amendment 71, which makes it harder to amend the Colorado Constitution, could be viewed as anti-grassroots or limiting direct democracy ([Colorado Politics](https://www.coloradopolitics.com/capitol-s-new-crop-jeff-hurd-colorado-s-accidental-politician-who-is-taking-over-boebert/article_8c96aa5b-6bc2-55cf-909a-8a5e21e37e3e.html)).

-   Emphasizing the preeminence of Congress and willingness to challenge executive overreach regardless of which party holds the presidency may upset party loyalists who expect partisan unity, especially around controversial executive actions ([Colorado Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPD-TB83-RWFF-D4ST-00000-00&context=1519360)).
