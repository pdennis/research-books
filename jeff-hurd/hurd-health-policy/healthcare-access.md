# Health Care Access and Affordability

### Summary

-   Despite repeated public commitments to protect Medicaid for "those who need it most," Rep. Jeff Hurd voted for House budget resolutions projected to significantly cut Medicaid funding---votes widely reported by local news and highlighted by letter writers ([The Journal, 2/27/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F7G-6K53-RY93-545N-00000-00&context=1519360); [Summit Daily News, 4/1/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FG2-TC53-RRY6-G02S-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Contradictions exist between Hurd's voting record toward Medicaid cuts and his messaging, which emphasizes preservation of services for vulnerable populations; this has led to criticism from constituents and media ([Aspen Times, 3/23/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FDC-1XJ3-S1YY-M151-00000-00&context=1519360); [Montrose Daily Press, 3/1/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F7R-GH73-RS07-116W-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd's support for introducing or expanding Medicaid work requirements is controversial, especially given the high proportion (about 26--31%) of his constituents enrolled in Medicaid and reliance among vulnerable rural populations ([Durango Herald, 3/12/25](https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/u-s-rep-jeff-hurd-talks-doge-energy-policy-ukraine-in-first-tele-town-hall/); [The Journal, 3/23/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FDJ-64G3-RRN0-H4PC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Numerous sources highlight the risk that Medicaid cuts or stricter eligibility could lead to loss of coverage for tens of thousands in his district, putting rural hospitals and health centers under additional strain ([The Journal, 3/23/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FDJ-64G3-RRN0-H4PC-00000-00&context=1519360); [Durango Herald, 4/22/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMT-TD63-RSVX-V3FP-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd's campaign rhetoric promises broader rural health care access, but multiple editorials and opinion writers note a lack of specific policy proposals or actionable plans to address rural health disparities ([Hal Bidlack, Coloradopolitics.com, 9/20/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0Y-KPH1-DXVP-T1MR-00000-00&context=1519360)).
