# Public Health Policy and Advocacy

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd has cited personal experiences with his mother's cancer and the challenges of accessing healthcare in rural Colorado to highlight the need for improved public health policy ([Coloradopolitics.com, 9/19/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0W-9DR1-DXVP-T19B-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   In campaign communications and advertisements, Hurd has made rural healthcare access a central issue, sharing firsthand accounts of families travelling long distances for basic care ([Coloradopolitics.com, 9/19/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0W-9DR1-DXVP-T19B-00000-00&context=1519360); [Hal Bidlack - Coloradopolitics.com, 9/20/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0Y-KPH1-DXVP-T1MR-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd has been recognized by local leaders, such as Kaye Hotsenpiller, for his efforts to better understand the rural health system and collaborate with policymakers like Senator Bennet ([Montrose Daily Press, 4/30/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FP9-KN63-RRWF-B07Y-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Advocacy for improved healthcare in rural areas is a key part of Hurd's campaign messaging, emphasizing the importance of better solutions for Colorado's 3rd Congressional District ([Coloradopolitics.com, 9/19/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0W-9DR1-DXVP-T19B-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   A potential vulnerability exists if Hurd's focus on personal and campaign narratives does not translate into specific, actionable health policy proposals for rural communities.
