# Health Care Funding and Spending

### Summary

-   Rep. Jeff Hurd repeatedly emphasized the need to reduce improper Medicaid payments and administrative red tape, citing estimates of \$50 billion in annual improper payments ([NPR Interview, 5/2/25](https://www.bpr.org/npr-news/2025-05-02/house-budget-bill-should-preserve-medicaids-original-purpose-says-rep-jeff-hurd)).

-   Hurd voted with House Republicans to adopt a budget resolution in February 2025 that would require the Committee on Energy and Commerce to cut \$880 billion in Medicaid spending ([Durango Herald, 3/12/25](https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/u-s-rep-jeff-hurd-talks-doge-energy-policy-ukraine-in-first-tele-town-hall/); [The Journal, 3/12/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FB6-H7R3-RSFV-F31R-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd stated his support for Medicaid changes is rooted in achieving efficiencies, reducing fraud, waste, and abuse, not deep service cuts, though the specifics depend on committee outcomes ([Montrose Daily Press, 2/28/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F79-J5X3-RV2G-N1G0-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He acknowledged that Medicaid spending has grown dramatically over the past decade and advocated for using funds more effectively to protect critical resources ([Durango Herald, 4/22/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMT-TD63-RSVX-V3FP-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd publicly communicated his priorities on Medicaid policy, stressing the need to protect the most vulnerable while supporting broader Republican goals ([NPR Interview, 5/2/25](https://www.bpr.org/npr-news/2025-05-02/house-budget-bill-should-preserve-medicaids-original-purpose-says-rep-jeff-hurd)).

-   Potential vulnerability: While Hurd frames his approach as focused on efficiency, voting for large-scale cuts---\$880 billion---could raise concerns about impacts on Medicaid coverage and services if efficiencies alone do not materialize.
