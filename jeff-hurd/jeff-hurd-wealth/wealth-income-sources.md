### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd, a Grand Junction attorney, raised over \$400,000 in his first quarter as a congressional candidate, spending about \$50,000 and ending with roughly \$350,000 on hand ([Coloradopolitics.com](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69DN-G8X1-DXVP-T4DD-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   After launching his campaign in August 2023, Hurd secured more than \$412,000 in the third quarter, spending approximately \$57,000 and starting October with \$356,000 cash on hand ([Colorado Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69DK-65Y1-DXVP-T0MV-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   A super PAC named "A Strong Innovation Economy Requires Strong IP Protection" spent \$100,000 in support of Hurd between October 2023 and September 2024 ([Colorado Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D3D-YKH1-DXVP-T2XY-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd's fundraising includes contributions from prominent Republican donors in Mesa County, with notable figures collectively donating several thousand dollars ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69Y0-5G11-DXVP-T4HX-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   As a congressional candidate, Hurd stands to earn a salary of \$174,000 if elected, as highlighted in a Durango Herald letter to the editor ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F7R-GH73-RRT0-R4X1-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerability: Reliance on large donors and super PAC support could introduce perceptions of external influence or questions about grassroots backing.
