# Campaign Operations, Fundraising, and Public Perception

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd built strong support from Colorado's GOP establishment, securing endorsements from former Governor Bill Owens, ex-Senator Hank Brown, multiple former and current local and state officials, and major conservative groups including Americans for Prosperity Action ([Colorado Sun](https://www.coloradopolitics.com/elections/2024/republican-jeff-hurd-endorsed-by-colorado-legislators/article_4aa2f312-a5a9-11ee-9799-0f10542c49ca.html), [Colorado Sun](https://coloradosun.com/2024/06/18/colorado-cd3-primary-adams-frisch-jeff-hurd/), [Denver Post](https://www.denverpost.com/2024/04/17/colorado-jeff-hurd-campaign-fundraising/)).

-   Hurd led Republican fundraising in Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, raising over \$1.2 million by mid-2024---much of it from Colorado donors and individual contributions---but was significantly outpaced by Democrat Adam Frisch's multi-million-dollar war chest ([Durango Herald](https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/jeff-hurd-leads-primary-fundraising/), [Denver Post](https://www.denverpost.com/2024/07/17/colorado-congressional-campaign-finance/), [Aspen Times](https://www.aspentimes.com/news/hurd-frisch-campaign-finances-colorado-cd3/)).

-   Outside spending played a major role, with Super PACs like Americans for Prosperity Action and Congressional Leadership Fund spending nearly \$2 million to back Hurd, while Democratic-aligned groups aired attack ads and attempted to influence the GOP primary by boosting his rivals ([Colorado Sun](https://coloradosun.com/2024/11/06/colorado-congressional-election-results-spending/), [Summit Daily News](https://www.summitdaily.com/news/rocky-mountain-values-colorado-gop-primary-hurd/)).

-   Hurd's campaign and supporters emphasized grassroots operations, utilizing extensive personal outreach and volunteer networks to counteract heavy spending disadvantages and attack ads from both left-leaning groups and rival Republicans ([Fort Morgan Times](https://www.fortmorgantimes.com/2024/12/07/colorado-election-campaign-spending/), [Denver Post](https://www.denverpost.com/2024/12/07/colorado-election-spending/)).

-   Despite establishment support, high fundraising, and a message of pragmatic conservatism, Hurd was sometimes criticized by opponents as an "old-guard" Republican or "country club Republican," and was outspent and out-raised by Democrats, representing a potential vulnerability in wider appeal and financial strength ([Colorado Sun](https://coloradosun.com/2024/05/30/colorado-cd3-super-pac-jeff-hurd/), [Daily Record](https://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/2024/04/26/colorado-jeff-hurd-campaign-fundraising/)).

-   Hurd campaigned on being prepared, accessible, solutions-focused, and committed to local (rather than national) priorities, stating he would listen to all constituents and cautioning against divisive, partisan tactics ([Durango Herald](https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/jeff-hurd-listening-candidate/), [Denver Gazette](https://denvergazette.com/ejections/jeff-hurd-campaign-style/)).
