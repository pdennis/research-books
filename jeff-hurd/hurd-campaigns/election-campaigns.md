# Election Campaigns and Political Races

### Summary

-   Hurd was frequently labeled as the "establishment" Republican, which could alienate the party's Trump-aligned or MAGA base and leave him open to criticism from more populist GOP rivals ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CBS-3KC1-JBCN-31C1-00000-00&context=1519360), [Colorado Politics](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CMP-1741-JBCN-354M-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Despite eventual large establishment support, Hurd had to overcome both skepticism from grassroots and challenges from farther-right/MAGA-aligned candidates, drawing Democratic efforts to prop up opponents considered easier to beat ([FOX 31 KDVR](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CBT-81T1-DXVP-T552-00000-00&context=1519360), [Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C6T-3YH1-DXVP-T1DW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd was at times criticized for lacking prior campaign and electoral experience, potentially making his campaign organization and outreach less practiced or robust than some rivals ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CBS-3KC1-JBCN-31C1-00000-00&context=1519360), [Colorado Politics](https://www.coloradopolitics.com/capitol-s-new-crop-jeff-hurd-colorado-s-accidental-politician-who-is-taking-over-boebert/article_8c96aa5b-6bc2-55cf-909a-8a5e21e37e3e.html)).

-   His relatively moderate messaging and deliberate avoidance of national controversies or "headline-grabbing" positions---while appealing to some---risked dampening enthusiasm with voters seeking stronger culture-war or hard-right stances ([Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5V-K881-JBCN-31C1-00000-00&context=1519360), [Colorado Politics](https://www.coloradopolitics.com/capitol-s-new-crop-jeff-hurd-colorado-s-accidental-politician-who-is-taking-over-boebert/article_8c96aa5b-6bc2-55cf-909a-8a5e21e37e3e.html)).

-   Post-election, analysts noted his win was narrower than typical GOP margins in the district, signaling ongoing competitiveness and potential vulnerability in future cycles, with national forecasters and organizations like EMILY's List already targeting his seat ([Denver Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DCB-1X81-DXVP-T456-00000-00&context=1519360), [Daily Camera](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FKY-32W3-RT7W-Y000-00000-00&context=1519360)).
