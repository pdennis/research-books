# Outreach and Campaign Style

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd emphasized a focus on local issues, repeatedly stating his goal as a congressional candidate was to "make local -- not national -- headlines," distancing himself from attention-seeking national politics ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C7V-YYN1-DXVP-T4TH-00000-00&context=1519360); [Colorado Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DC5-CV71-JBCN-3149-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He campaigned as an "old-school Republican," appealing to tradition-minded voters and seeking to distinguish himself from more polarizing figures ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DC6-VB61-DXVP-T1J2-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd self-deprecatingly described himself as "as exciting as a bread sandwich," suggesting a no-drama, steady leadership style suited to rural Colorado ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DC6-VB61-DXVP-T1J2-00000-00&context=1519360); [Colorado Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DC5-CV71-JBCN-3149-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   He promised to be "serious, hardworking, prepared and accessible to the media," vowing transparency and accessibility if elected ([Colorado Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBY-D8G1-DXVP-T05V-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd's understated style and focus on local issues may help counter negative national political trends but could also be perceived as lacking excitement or charisma, a point he acknowledged himself.
