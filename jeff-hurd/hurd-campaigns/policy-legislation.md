# Policy Positions and Legislative Focus

### Summary

-   Heavy emphasis on border security and alignment with Trump could alienate moderate and independent voters uncomfortable with hardline immigration stances ([Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BX1-GCY1-DXVP-T205-00000-00&context=1519360), [Pueblo Chieftain](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D09-16M1-JB1V-G0GP-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Focus on energy independence and opposition to Democratic regulations may limit appeal among environmentally conscious voters or those concerned about climate change ([Coloradopolitics.com](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CX9-N571-DXVP-T4P6-00000-00&context=1519360), [Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68YM-DTX1-DXVP-T442-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Repeated criticism of federal regulations and Democratic policies risks being seen as overly partisan, despite stated willingness to work across the aisle ([Coloradopolitics.com](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CMP-1741-JBCN-354M-00000-00&context=1519360), [Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D21-Y5Y1-JBCN-31J3-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Main policy priorities (border, energy, water, agriculture) are repeated frequently, potentially making the platform seem lacking in breadth or responsiveness to broader voter concerns ([Journal - Cortez, Dolores, Mancos, CO](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CBK-8K11-JBCN-33TT-00000-00&context=1519360), [Pueblo Chieftain](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DCT-KWK1-JB1V-G1PC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Critiques of government regulations without specific alternatives might be viewed as lacking substantive policy solutions for economic and rural challenges ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C7V-YYN1-DXVP-T4TH-00000-00&context=1519360)).
