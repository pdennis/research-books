### Campaign Strategy and Messaging

#### Conservative Republican Positioning

**Jeff Hurd Described Himself As Guided By Conservative Principles In 2023** According to Montrose Daily Press, "The Republican is focused on local issues, and said he's guided by the conservative principles of small government, individual rights, rule of law and free markets." \[Montrose Daily Press, [9/14/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:695M-XPD1-DXVP-T200-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2024: Jeff Hurd Identified With Conservative Republican Legislative Approach** According to The Denver Gazette, "I think you'll find that I am a conservative Republican legislator as well," Hurd said. "My style might be a little bit different, but when it comes to substance, I think there's a lot more alignment than it might appear, at least on the surface, and I guess we'll have to see how that plays out in the next Congress." \[Denver Gazette, [12/3/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DJR-KWT1-DXVP-T3BY-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
