# Community and Constituent Engagement

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd has prioritized virtual engagement with constituents by hosting telephone and online town halls since taking office, but has yet to hold an in-person town hall despite direct requests from community members ([Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FBW-DX43-S4D8-V266-00000-00), [Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FN1-SVJ3-RSD6-V0KR-00000-00)).

-   Multiple constituent events and rallies, including those in Grand Junction and Dolores, saw significant local attendance, often in Hurd's absence, which led to criticism about his accessibility and the responsiveness of his staff ([The Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F6W-M123-RSBH-X1WC-00000-00), [Delta County Independent](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FJ1-C0P3-S0CY-K0T3-00000-00)).

-   Hurd and his staff did not pre-screen questions for virtual town halls, allowing for direct questioning on sensitive topics such as public lands, USFS firings, and Medicaid ([Journal-Advocate](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FC2-77J3-RSD7-B3WJ-00000-00), [Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FBP-3H63-RT1M-20WY-00000-00)).

-   Notably, Hurd attended industrial and business tours but missed or declined some major constituent-focused events, leading to accusations of being out of touch with "regular people" ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F6W-M123-RSBH-X2NG-00000-00), [Delta County Independent](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FJ1-C0P3-S0CY-K0T3-00000-00)).

-   Public protests in Durango, involving hundreds of participants, targeted Hurd's office, but on one occasion, he engaged directly with protesters outside a meeting, stopping to listen and converse ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FN1-SVJ3-RSD6-V0KR-00000-00)).

-   Potential vulnerability: Repeated criticism from constituents and the local press centers on Hurd's limited in-person engagement and the perception of an unresponsive district office, especially after high-attendance events where neither he nor key staff were present ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FJ1-C0P3-S0CY-K0T3-00000-00), [Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F73-K0N3-RRX3-R2W3-00000-00)).
