# Elections and Campaigns

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd, a Grand Junction attorney, entered the 2024 race for Colorado's 3rd Congressional District to challenge incumbent Lauren Boebert and quickly secured endorsements from prominent state and local Republican officials, including former Governor Bill Owens and multiple county commissioners ([CPR News](https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/14/vg-2024-3rd-congressional-district-jeff-hurd/), [Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6961-J951-DXVP-T4PX-00000-00&context=1519360), [Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C7V-YYN1-DXVP-T4TH-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   After Boebert switched districts, Hurd won a six-way Republican primary in June 2024 with about 41--42% of the vote, defeating state Rep. Ron Hanks by a wide margin and benefiting from both state and national GOP support, as well as significant super PAC spending ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CBM-K461-JBCN-34SC-00000-00&context=1519360), [Colorado Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CBK-4GJ1-JBCN-347B-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The general election saw Hurd defeat Democrat Adam Frisch by 5 percentage points, a wider margin than Boebert's narrow 2022 victory; Hurd was officially elected in November 2024 and assumed office in January 2025 ([Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DKK-4WP1-DXVP-T2V7-00000-00&context=1519360), [Aspen Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DC5-6B51-JBCN-33FP-00000-00&context=1519360), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hurd_(politician)).

-   Hurd raised significant campaign funds (over \$2.4 million by election day) but was still outspent by Frisch and faced a wave of negative advertising, including attack ads funded by Democratic PACs and Frisch's own campaign, which also intervened in the Republican primary ([Colorado Sun](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CBK-4GJ1-JBCN-347B-00000-00&context=1519360), [Aspen Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DC5-6B51-JBCN-33FP-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Despite strong outside and establishment support, Hurd was criticized by opponents for missing debates, being a "corporate lawyer," and not disclosing positions on some issues; he was also targeted by Emily's List as a "top target for defeat" in 2026, signaling continued electoral vulnerability ([Pueblo Chieftain](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CBT-D841-DXGX-6249-00000-00&context=1519360), [Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FM3-4773-RVK8-V1RN-00000-00&context=1519360)).
