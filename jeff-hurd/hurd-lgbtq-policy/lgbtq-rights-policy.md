#### Public Remarks on LGBTQ Equality

**June 2024: Jeff Hurd Condemned Colorado GOP's Anti-Pride Message** According to Coloradopolitics.com, "In the 3rd Congressional District, Republican candidate Jeff Hurd called the message 'another massive failure by state GOP leadership.' He blasted Williams for alluding to the Westboro Baptist Church slogan, which Hurd characterized as 'both un-Christian and wrong.' 'I strongly condemn it,' Hurd said in a text message. 'The message itself is fundamentally against what we need to do as Republicans in Colorado which is adding and multiplying voters who support us, not dividing and subtracting them.'" \[Coloradopolitics.com, [6/4/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C64-R241-DXVP-T0CN-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
