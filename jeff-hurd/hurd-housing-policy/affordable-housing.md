# Affordable Housing Initiatives and Policies

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd advocated for expanding the housing supply by reducing regulatory costs and supporting innovative solutions, emphasizing the need for state and local decision-makers to take the lead ([CPR News](https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/14/vg-2024-3rd-congressional-district-jeff-hurd/)).

-   He supported lowering tariffs on essential building materials and reducing construction and energy costs to make housing more affordable ([CPR News](https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/14/vg-2024-3rd-congressional-district-jeff-hurd/); [Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5V-K881-JBCN-31C1-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Hurd backed streamlining federal regulations and environmental reviews and favored more predictable building codes to reduce delays and expenses for housing development ([CPR News](https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/14/vg-2024-3rd-congressional-district-jeff-hurd/)).

-   He endorsed targeted tax incentives for developers, particularly in underdeveloped areas, and supported modular and manufactured housing as affordable alternatives ([CPR News](https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/14/vg-2024-3rd-congressional-district-jeff-hurd/)).

-   Hurd did not support federal or state intervention to change local zoning, but favored supporting local governments in streamlining their own zoning processes and cutting red tape ([CPR News](https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/14/vg-2024-3rd-congressional-district-jeff-hurd/); [Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D60-KM21-DXVP-T548-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   A potential vulnerability is Hurd's resistance to changing local zoning rules at the federal or state level, which could limit broader efforts to boost housing supply in areas where local governments are less proactive ([Denver Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D60-KM21-DXVP-T548-00000-00&context=1519360)).

### Support for Affordable Housing Programs

#### Stance on federal affordable housing funding

**Jeff Hurd Advocated Federal Policies To Expand Housing Supply And Lower Regulatory Costs In 2024** According to CPR News, "As a member of Congress, I would support these state and local decision-makers while working to support policies that expand housing supply, reduce regulatory costs, and encourage innovative solutions to increase attainability." \[CPR News, [10/14/24](https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/14/vg-2024-3rd-congressional-district-jeff-hurd/)\]

**Jeff Hurd Supported Reducing Tariffs On Essential Building Materials In 2024** According to CPR News, "At the federal level, I would support reducing tariffs on essential building materials and promoting reliable, affordable energy to lower construction and maintenance costs." \[CPR News, [10/14/24](https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/14/vg-2024-3rd-congressional-district-jeff-hurd/)\]

**October 2024: Hurd Advocated Careful Approach To Congressional Direct Spending And Increased Housing Supply** According to Durango Herald, "Hurd wants to 'be more careful' about how direct congressional spending is used. He wants to see increases in the housing supply by advocating for more housing permits. He also wants to focus spending on industries that supply housing materials such as lumber and steel. Hurd wants direct spending to go toward energy or infrastructure projects such as the Arkansas Valley Conduit." \[Durango Herald (Colorado), [10/2/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D3R-PGC1-JBCN-311G-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**Jeff Hurd Proposed Lowering Construction And Energy Costs To Address Housing Affordability** According to Denver Post, "Asked about affordability issues, Hurd said the supply of housing needed to be increased by lowering the cost of construction materials and by lowering energy costs. He, like Frisch, did not support state or federal-level changes to local zoning rules intended to boost housing supply." \[Denver Post, [10/13/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5V-K881-JBCN-31C1-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

#### Support for low-income housing tax credits

**Jeff Hurd Backed Targeted Tax Incentives For Developers And Supported Modular Housing In 2024** According to CPR News, "I also back reasonable, targeted tax incentives for developers in underdeveloped areas and support modular and manufactured housing as affordable alternatives." \[CPR News, [10/14/24](https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/14/vg-2024-3rd-congressional-district-jeff-hurd/)\]

### Approach to Housing Regulation

#### Attitudes toward government intervention in housing markets

**2024: Jeff Hurd Supported Streamlining Federal Regulations For Housing Development** According to CPR News, "I would also work to streamline federal regulations, including applicable environmental reviews, to make housing development more efficient and less costly. I also support more reasonable energy compliance codes and uniform building codes that change less frequently, providing consistency and predictability." \[CPR News, [10/14/24](https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/14/vg-2024-3rd-congressional-district-jeff-hurd/)\]

**2024: Hurd Criticized Regulatory Burdens On Housing Permits In Pueblo County** According to Denver Gazette, "Hurd called the concept 'Democratic math,' noting that the federal dollars Frisch is referring to should be used more for infrastructure. Hurd said the government needs to reduce regulations and red tape that prevent housing construction. He said last year, only 500 housing permits were approved in Pueblo County, when there needed to be 1,400." \[Denver Gazette, [10/1/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D3H-85M1-DXVP-T0D8-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2024: Jeff Hurd Opposed Changes To Local Zoning Rules To Increase Housing Supply** According to Denver Post, 'He, like Frisch, did not support state or federal-level changes to local zoning rules intend to boost housing supply.' \[Denver Post, [10/13/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D60-KM21-DXVP-T548-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

#### Views on land use and zoning policy

**Jeff Hurd Supported Local Governments In Streamlining Zoning For Affordable Housing In 2024** According to CPR News, "While respecting local control over land-use decisions, I will support local governments in streamlining zoning regulations and cutting red tape to encourage affordable housing." \[CPR News, [10/14/24](https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/14/vg-2024-3rd-congressional-district-jeff-hurd/)\]
