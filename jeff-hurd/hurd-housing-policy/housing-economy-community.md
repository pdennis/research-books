# Housing, Economy, and Community Development

### Economic Impact of Housing Policy

#### Concerns about inflation and cost of living

**2024: Hurd Supported Homeownership Tax Policies And Rural Infrastructure Improvements** According to CPR News, "As a Member of Congress I would also uphold tax policies that promote homeownership, such as incentives for first-time buyers and for developers building attainable rental housing in rural areas. Finally, I will focus on improving infrastructure in rural areas to incentivize development and support increased access to financing for homebuyers and builders to spur growth in these communities." \[CPR News, [10/14/24](https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/14/vg-2024-3rd-congressional-district-jeff-hurd/)\]
