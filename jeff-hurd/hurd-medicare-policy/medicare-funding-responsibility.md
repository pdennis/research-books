# Medicare Funding and Fiscal Responsibility

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd has publicly emphasized his commitment to protecting Social Security and Medicare, stating that expanding access to health care in rural Colorado is a top priority ([Colorado Politics](https://www.coloradopolitics.com/elections/2024/republican-jeff-hurd-vows-to-prioritize-expanding-access-to-health-care-in-rural-colorado-in-new-ad/article_73344df2-75f7-11ef-8fb7-a300c1793667.html), 9/19/24).

-   Hurd's campaign and supporters have repeatedly highlighted his promise to safeguard Medicare and Social Security, as reported in opinion coverage ([Hal Bidlack - Coloradopolitics.com](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0Y-KPH1-DXVP-T1MR-00000-00&context=1519360), 9/20/24).

-   In February 2025, Hurd supported a budget resolution that required deficit reduction from the committee overseeing Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP, potentially leaving the door open to future cuts, although no specific cuts were named in the bill ([Aspen Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FD5-DJ13-RTHX-43C3-00000-00&context=1519360), 3/23/25).

-   Hurd's office reaffirmed his opposition to cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, stating he would work to protect these programs during the budget process ([Aspen Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FD5-DJ13-RTHX-43C3-00000-00&context=1519360), 3/23/25).

-   In April 2025, Hurd joined colleagues in sending a letter to House leadership opposing Medicaid cuts, insisting that budget reforms should not reduce coverage for vulnerable populations ([Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FP9-KN63-RRWF-B07Y-00000-00&context=1519360), 4/30/25).

-   Potential vulnerability: Supporting the February 2025 budget resolution may invite scrutiny about his stance, as the bill tasked committees with significant deficit reduction, which could put entitlement programs like Medicare at risk despite his stated opposition to cuts.
