# International Trade Policy

### Summary

-   May Alienate Trump-Aligned Voters: Hurd's leadership on bipartisan bills to restrain President Trump's unilateral tariff authority directly challenges Trump and the party base, risking backlash among core Republican constituents ([Denver Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPH-3KV3-SCNV-T051-00000-00&context=1519360), [Pueblo Chieftain](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FJ7-15C3-SC44-Y4RN-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Perceived Insufficient Support for Tariffs: Although Hurd supports targeted tariffs and some Trump goals, his strong opposition to broad-based tariffs and his emphasis on congressional oversight may be viewed by protectionists as too moderate or out of step with populist calls for robust trade restrictions ([CPR News](https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/14/vg-2024-3rd-congressional-district-jeff-hurd/), [Denver Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FJ1-PR03-RW24-N1SJ-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Risk of Being Seen as Ineffective or Symbolic: Multiple sources describe Hurd's tariff oversight legislation as "doomed" with little chance of passage due to strong Trump-aligned opposition in Congress, suggesting accomplishments may be more symbolic than substantive ([Fort Morgan Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FM2-M0M3-RWPF-44M0-00000-00&context=1519360), [Daily Record](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FM2-M0M3-RWPF-44H3-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Vulnerable to Criticism from Both Sides: Hurd attempts a balancing act between supporting manufacturing jobs (a Trump talking point) and upholding constitutional checks on executive power; this opens him to attacks from both pro-tariff Republicans and Democrats skeptical of his loyalties ([Coloradopolitics.com](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FJ1-PR03-RW24-N1FF-00000-00&context=1519360), [Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FKR-YH83-RSKV-M3MM-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Risk of Alienating Constituency Sensitive to Tariffs: Constituents in Colorado's 3rd District---especially farmers and small businesses---could be negatively impacted by tariffs, and any perceived lack of protection or overemphasis on limiting executive power over practical outcomes could be politically damaging ([Denver Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FJ1-PR03-RW24-N1SJ-00000-00&context=1519360), [Montrose Daily Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FJ8-56X3-S7KM-T321-00000-00&context=1519360))
