# Banking, Financial Regulation, and Trade

### Summary

-   Jeff Hurd voiced concerns about Trump's proposal for blanket tariffs, arguing that tariffs should be used "strategically and thoughtfully" to reduce reliance on foreign resources, especially critical minerals ([Colorado Newsline](https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/12/27/jeff-hurd-boeberts-new-style/)).

-   In April 2025, Hurd cosponsored a House bill that would require Congress to approve or revoke new tariffs, aiming to reclaim congressional authority over trade policy ([Durango Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FHV-6X13-RSWX-N01N-00000-00&context=1519360)).
