**November 2024: Jeff Hurd Stated Gratitude For Team Support On Election Day** According to Pueblo Chieftain, "'It's been a wild ride, and I'm so grateful for all the support we've received from the team,' Hurd shared on his social media pages the morning of Election Day. 'Today, I'm voting for my family's future and the future of our district. I hope you do, too.'" \[Pueblo Chieftain, [11/7/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DC5-P531-DXGX-60SB-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
