<h2>Hinson Voted For Medicaid Cuts&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>Hinson Voted For Medicaid Cuts&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>Hinson Voted For The “One Big Beautiful Bill”&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Hinson Voted For The Senate FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Extended $4 Trillion In Expiring Tax Cuts, Added New Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025, Hinson voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, the “motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214.

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Bill Would Reduce Medicaid And Children’s Health Insurance Program Funding By $1 Trillion And Remove 10.5 Million People From The Programs By 2034.</strong> According to the Center For American Progress, “The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the OBBBA will cut federal spending on Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) benefits by $1.02 trillion, due in part to eliminating at least 10.5 million people from the programs by 2034.” [Center For American Progress, <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-truth-about-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-acts-cuts-to-medicaid-and-medicare/">7/3/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Bill Established A Medicaid Work Requirement That Would Effectively Cause Eligible People To Lose Coverage Due To Burdensome Paperwork.</strong> According to the Center For American Progress, “Indeed, only 8 percent of recipients between the ages of 19 and 64 who weren’t on SSI or SSDI in 2023 ‘[weren’t] working due to retirement, inability to find work, or other reason[s].’ Those who were not working were statistically more likely to be older women who left the workforce to care for aging parents or children. The OBBBA requires individuals to prove that they are working, engaging in community service, or receiving work training for at least 80 hours per month—or that they are enrolled in school part time—unless they qualify for an exemption. Medicaid enrollees who are trying to find a job, are having difficulty finding employment, or who lack reliable transportation to work would be penalized under this requirement. That includes at least more than 2.6 million adults with disabilities who don’t have SSI or SSDI and have difficulty working due to disability or illness. Research indicates that paperwork requirements such as those in the bill—particularly for Medicaid—don’t increase employment rates and often increase overhead costs. A group of researchers evaluated the first year of paperwork reporting requirements in Arkansas and found that there was a significant loss of Medicaid coverage in the initial six months among eligible people and no significant change in employment.” [Center For American Progress, <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-truth-about-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-acts-cuts-to-medicaid-and-medicare/">7/3/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>The Bill’s $50 Billion In Rural Hospital Relief Funding Would Not Come Close To The Gap Created By Medicaid Cuts, With 300 Rural Hospital At “Immediate Risk” Of Closure.</strong> According to the Center For American Progress, “The OBBBA includes $50 billion in relief funding for rural hospitals over a five-year period to help reduce the disastrous impacts of the bill’s roughly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts. As of May 2025, there were approximately 2,086 rural hospitals receiving $12.2 billion a year in net revenue from Medicaid. At the median, rural hospitals’ revenue from Medicaid is $3.9 million a year.Rural hospitals have some of the lowest operating margins in the nation, especially compared with urban hospitals, meaning that any reductions in revenue could lead to closures. The average operating margin for rural hospitals was 3.1 percent in 2023, with 44 percent of rural hospitals operating with negative margins. As a result, more than 300 rural hospitals are currently at ‘immediate risk’ of closure, especially now that the OBBBA is projected to cut Medicaid spending by $1.02 trillion. The relief fund designed to blunt the negative impacts caused by the bill would not come close to filling that gap. If every rural hospital in the country received an even share of the $50 billion in relief support, it would amount to only $4.5 million every year for five years. At the close of those five years, that funding would disappear altogether.” [Center For American Progress, <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-truth-about-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-acts-cuts-to-medicaid-and-medicare/">7/3/25</a>]</li>

<p><strong>[VIDEO] Hinson Claimed That The Only People Losing Access To Benefits From The “One Big Beautiful Bill” Were Undocumented Immigrants And “People Gaming The System.”&nbsp;</strong>“So you have people who are disabled, who qualify for Medicaid, who qualify for SNAP because they meet those requirements and they're working. So at the bare minimum, the only people who need to be worried about losing access to benefits are illegal immigrants and people who are gaming the system. And so when I go out to the communities and I talk about that, people are like, Yeah, it seems fair that if you are an able bodied working adult, that if you're taking that government benefit funded by taxpayers, that you should have a job.” [KTTC Interview, <a href="https://youtu.be/_x5ZK5RMX4o">8/30/25</a>]; 250830_EGJ_2095</p>

<p><strong>[AUDIO] Hinson Wanted The “Big Beautiful Bill” To Do Deeper Cuts.&nbsp;</strong>“So I hope they make minimal changes because of the work that we've done in the House to flush this bill out and get it to a point where it could pass. And again, to the the conservatives who want to pass even further cuts. Hey, I wish we could go further, too, but we have to build a consensus.” [Fox News Rundown, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/ashley-hinson-fox-news-rundown-6425/s-SgRg9XC8GmB?si=3b0a846e0ae049a5961a69c22c373aac&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">6/4/25</a>]</p>

<p><strong>17 Million Americans Could Result Lose Their Health Coverage As A Result Of The “One Big Beautiful Bill.”&nbsp;</strong>According to the Washington Post, “&nbsp;The Senate version of President Donald Trump’s massive tax and immigration spending plan would wipe out many of the strides made by the Affordable Care Act in reducing the number of uninsured Americans, resulting in at least 17 million Americans losing their health coverage, according to nonpartisan estimates and experts.” [Washington Post,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/">7/1/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>86,000 Iowans Would Lose Their Medicaid Coverage Due To The “One Big Beautiful Bill.”&nbsp;</strong>According to the Des Moines Register, “&nbsp;According to KFF, a health information nonprofit, Iowa would lose $518 million in federal funding, which is a 25% cut to its state spending per resident. Based on that funding loss, KFF estimates more than 86,000 Iowans would lose their Medicaid coverage.” [Des Moines Register,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/22/iowa-impact-of-congress-budget-cuts-to-medicaid-snap/83742388007/">5/22/25</a>]</p>

But reaction to the bill wasn’t nearly so positive at a town hall she held in May. On that occasion, just the mention of being ‘proud to vote for Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill’ was met with boos.” [Washington Post,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/29/one-big-beautiful-bill-republican-lawmakers-ashley-hinson-trump/">8/29/25</a>]</li>
