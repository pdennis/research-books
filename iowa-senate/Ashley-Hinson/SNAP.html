<h3>Hinson Voted For SNAP Cuts&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>Hinson Voted For The “One Big Beautiful Bill” Which Cut SNAP&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Hinson Voted For The Senate FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Extended $4 Trillion In Expiring Tax Cuts, Added New Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025, Hinson voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, the “motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214.

Ashley Hinson praised President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill at her fifth annual ‘BBQ Bash’ here last weekend, celebrating the measure’s changes to taxes on tips and other tax cuts that she says are aimed at the middle class.” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/29/one-big-beautiful-bill-republican-lawmakers-ashley-hinson-trump/">8/29/25</a>]</p>
<h5><i>Hinson Claimed That The Only People Losing Access To Benefits From The “One Big Beautiful Bill” Were Undocumented Immigrants And “People Gaming The System”</i></h5>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Hinson Claimed That The Only People Losing Access To Benefits From The “One Big Beautiful Bill” Were Undocumented Immigrants And “People Gaming The System.”&nbsp;</strong>“So you have people who are disabled, who qualify for Medicaid, who qualify for SNAP because they meet those requirements and they're working. So at the bare minimum, the only people who need to be worried about losing access to benefits are illegal immigrants and people who are gaming the system. And so when I go out to the communities and I talk about that, people are like, Yeah, it seems fair that if you are an able bodied working adult, that if you're taking that government benefit funded by taxpayers, that you should have a job.” [KTTC Interview, <a href="https://youtu.be/_x5ZK5RMX4o">8/30/25</a>]</p>
<h4>Hinson Wanted The “Big Beautiful Bill” To Do Deeper Cuts&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] Hinson Wanted The “Big Beautiful Bill” To Do Deeper Cuts.&nbsp;</strong>“So I hope they make minimal changes because of the work that we've done in the House to flush this bill out and get it to a point where it could pass. And again, to the the conservatives who want to pass even further cuts. Hey, I wish we could go further, too, but we have to build a consensus.” [Fox News Rundown, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/ashley-hinson-fox-news-rundown-6425/s-SgRg9XC8GmB?si=3b0a846e0ae049a5961a69c22c373aac&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">6/4/25</a>]</p>
<h3>“One Big Beautiful Bill” Slashed SNAP Benefits&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>“One Big Beautiful Bill” Slashed SNAP Benefits&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>22.3 Million Families Would Lose Some Or All Of Their SNAP Benefits, With 5.3 Million Families Losing Over $25 In Benefits A Month And Of Those Families, The Average Loss In Benefits Would Be $146.</strong> According to the Urban Institute, “Our preliminary estimates of the SNAP policies in the Senate bill show the following: 22.3 million US families would be affected, losing some or all of their SNAP benefits. Of the total affected families, 5.3 million would lose at least $25 in SNAP benefits per month. Among these families, 3.3 million are families with children, 3.5 million are working families, and 1.7 million are families with a full-time full-year worker. Families losing at least $25 per month would lose $146 per month on average ($1,752 for a full-year recipient). At the state level, average monthly benefit losses for families losing at least $25 per month would range from $72 in Kansas ($864 annually) to $231 in the District of Columbia ($2,772 annually).” [Urban Institute, <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/how-senate-budget-reconciliation-snap-proposals-will-affect-families-every-us">7/2/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>Research Suggested The SNAP Cuts Would Result In 93,000 Premature Deaths.</strong> According to the Leonard Davis Institute Of Health Economics, “Peer-reviewed research from other investigators has quantified the mortality rate of individuals under age 65 with SNAP as compared to a similar group without SNAP over a fourteen-year period.4 Assuming a similar risk profile as prior SNAP participants, if we apply that estimate to the 3.2 million Americans projected to lose SNAP benefits under the bill, that would result in 93,000 premature deaths due to the loss of SNAP between now and 2039.” [Leonard Davis Institute Of Health Economics, <a href="https://ldi.upenn.edu/our-work/research-updates/estimated-mortality-due-to-snap-provisions-in-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act/">7/3/25</a>]</p>
<h4>The Slashed SNAP Benefits Could Harm Iowans&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>Nearly 260,000 Iowans Were Enrolled In SNAP.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Des Moines Register, “&nbsp;Nearly 260,000 Iowans were enrolled in SNAP as of fiscal year 2024.” [Des Moines Register,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/22/iowa-impact-of-congress-budget-cuts-to-medicaid-snap/83742388007/">5/22/25</a>]</p>
