<p><strong><u>Hinson Voted For A GOP Debt Limit Package, Which Would Repeal Tax Credits For Wind Projects</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>2023: Hinson Voted For A GOP Debt Limit Package, Which Would Repeal Several Climate Tax Credits Under The Inflation Reduction Act, Especially The Tax Credits For Solar And Wind Projects, Sustainable Aviation Fuel And Clean Fuel Production.</strong> In April 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Hinson voted for the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023, which “Among energy- and climate-focused provisions, the bill would repeal, phase out or narrow a variety of climate-focused tax credits under the fiscal 2022 reconciliation package, including repealing new credits for solar and wind projects, sustainable aviation fuel and clean fuel production.” The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 217 to 215, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. [House Vote 199, <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll199.xml">4/26/23</a>; Congressional Quarterly, <a href="https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/199?5">4/26/23</a>; Congressional Actions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2811/all-actions">H.R. 2811</a>]</p>
<h4>Hinson Voted For The “One Big Beautiful Bill” Which Cut Clean Energy Credits&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Hinson Voted For The Senate FY 2025 Budget Reconciliation Bill That Extended $4 Trillion In Expiring Tax Cuts, Added New Tax Breaks, Appropriated $448 Billion In Defense, Border, And Immigration Enforcement Funding, Increased The SALT Deduction To $40,000, And Cut Medicaid And Other Social Programs To Offset The Costs.</strong> In July 2025, Hinson voted for, according to Congressional Quarterly, the “motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the bill that would permanently extend nearly $4 trillion in expiring individual and business tax cuts, create several new tax breaks and fund border and immigration enforcement and air traffic control upgrades. It would cut Medicaid and other safety net programs to partly offset the cost. Among other provisions, it would raise the statutory debt ceiling by $5 trillion and appropriate more than $448 billion in mandatory funding for Trump administration priorities and other needs, including $153 billion for defense, $89 billion for immigration enforcement, and $89.5 billion for border control and security. It also would increase the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 annually for five years for households making up to $500,000 a year until 2030, when it would permanently revert to $10,000.” The House passed the bill by a vote of 218 to 214. [House Vote 190, <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml">7/3/25</a>; Congressional Quarterly, <a href="https://plus.cq.com/vote/2025/H/190?2">7/3/25</a>; Congressional Actions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions">H.R. 1</a>]</p>
<p><strong>Hinson Claimed That The Republican’s Reconciliation Bill Was “Transformational” And Represented “A New Golden Age Of Energy Dominance.”&nbsp;</strong>According to the Gazette, “‘This is transformational legislation,’ Hinson said. ‘ … By advancing smart permitting reform, ensuring tax certainty for energy producers and rejecting harmful mandates, we can and will secure an affordable, reliable American-made energy future.’ Hinson said the bill represents ‘a new golden era of energy dominance’ and argued it would restore jobs, encourage investment and give families freedom to choose the cars they drive.” [Gazette, <a href="https://www.thegazette.com/federal-government/iowas-ashley-hinson-touts-gop-energy-policies-backs-immigration-crackdown/">8/28/25</a>]</p>
<h5><i>The ”One Big Beautiful Bill” Slashed Clean Energy Credits&nbsp;</i></h5>
<p><strong>The Bill Accelerated The Phase Out Of Clean Energy Tax Credits And Required Construction Of Non-Nuclear Energy To Start Within 60 Days Of The Bill’s Signing To Claim A Tax Credit.</strong> According to CNN, “In last-minute changes, Republicans sped up the timelines for phasing out key clean energy tax credits to the end of 2028. They also put in a new, narrow set of requirements for energy companies building solar, wind, battery or geothermal to generate electricity, only allowing companies to recoup the credit if they started construction within a 60-day window after the bill was signed into law, and their power was in service by the end of 2028.” [CNN, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/what-is-in-trump-tax-spending-cuts-package">5/28/25</a>]</p>
<h3>Clean Energy Supported Iowa’s Economy And Jobs&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>The Wind Industry Employed Around 4,000 Iowans&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>The Wind Industry Employed Around 4,000 People Across Iowa.&nbsp;</strong>According to Vox, “The wind industry also employs roughly 4,000 people across the state and draws billions of dollars in capital investments.” [Vox, <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/407981/wind-energy-iowa-trump-escape-velocity-energy-climate-progress">4/22/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>Iowa Had Over 50 Companies That Were A Part Of The Wind Industry.</strong> According to Politico, “The Republican stronghold gets more of its electricity from wind than any other state. More than 50 companies are part of its wind industry, which has drawn $22 billion in total investments in the past three decades. Despite Trump’s and Wright’s claims that wind power makes electricity more expensive and unreliable, Iowa’s power costs are among the lowest in the nation and its grid is among the most stable.” [Politico, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/01/trumps-anti-renewable-energy-spree-threatens-a-vulnerable-republican-in-wind-rich-iowa-00530060">9/1/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>Wind Farms Were The Top Taxpayer In A Third Of Iowa’s Counties And Provided $91.4 Million In Annual Lease Payments To Farmers.&nbsp;</strong>According to Politico, “Wind farms are the top taxpayer in a third of Iowa counties, contributing up to 55 percent of property taxes, and they provide $91.4 million in annual lease payments to farmers, according to Power Up Iowa, a coalition of renewable energy supporters that hosted an exhibit last month at the Iowa State Fair attended by Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds.” [Politico, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/01/trumps-anti-renewable-energy-spree-threatens-a-vulnerable-republican-in-wind-rich-iowa-00530060">9/1/25</a>]</p>
<h4>Iowa Farmers Used Wind Turbines As A Stable And Supplemental Source Of Income&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>Iowa Farmers Used Wind Turbines As A Stable And Supplemental Source Of Income.&nbsp;</strong>According to Vox, “The state’s many farmers — a core section of Iowa’s economy that maintains a lot of political power — have also helped the wind industry take off. Farmers across Iowa have put turbines on their land as a way to earn more income. While crop prices and yields are volatile and at the whims of natural disasters, wind turbines offer a relatively stable source of revenue, on the scale of thousands of dollars per year, per turbine.” [Vox, <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/407981/wind-energy-iowa-trump-escape-velocity-energy-climate-progress">4/22/25</a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>An Iowa Farmer Named Dave Johnson Claimed That Wind Turbines Helped Increase Of The Value Of His Farms.&nbsp;</strong>According to Vox, “‘It’s a real blessing for us,’ said Dave Johnson, a livestock farmer in northern Iowa who leases his land to a utility that installed four turbines on his property. He earns about $30,000 a year from the four turbines combined, he told Vox. Johnson’s son also has turbines on his farm. Johnson, a Republican who says he voted for Trump, had the turbines installed primarily because he wanted his farm — where he raises cattle and hogs — to generate more value. ‘I never had a 401(k),’ he said. ‘I farmed and stuck everything back into the farm. This is the 401(k) that I never had.’” [Vox, <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/407981/wind-energy-iowa-trump-escape-velocity-energy-climate-progress">4/22/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Johnson Claimed That Wind Energy Was Allowing Farmers To Stay On Their Farms And That It Helped Rural America.&nbsp;</strong>According to Vox, “Wind energy ‘is allowing farmers to stay on the farm,’ Johnson said. ‘That helps rural America.’” [Vox, <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/407981/wind-energy-iowa-trump-escape-velocity-energy-climate-progress">4/22/25</a>]</li>

<h4>The “One Big Beautiful Bill” Would Increase Iowan’s Electricity Bills&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>The Bill Would Increase American’s Electricity Bills As It Would Prevent Cheap Wind Energy To Get On The Grid.</strong> According to CNN, “In last-minute changes, Republicans sped up the timelines for phasing out key clean energy tax credits to the end of 2028. They also put in a new, narrow set of requirements for energy companies building solar, wind, battery or geothermal to generate electricity, only allowing companies to recoup the credit if they started construction within a 60-day window after the bill was signed into law, and their power was in service by the end of 2028. Analysts have also said the move will increase Americans’ electricity bills, since it would prevent cheaper wind, solar and batteries from getting on the grid at the same time power-hungry data centers and AI are coming online. The only carve-out was for nuclear energy, a form of clean energy touted by Trump and Republicans that is much more expensive and time-intensive to build than solar and wind.” [CNN, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/what-is-in-trump-tax-spending-cuts-package">5/28/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>The Reconciliation Bill Would Raise Clean Energy Costs And Lower The Pace Of New Supply Causing Electric Bills To Increase.&nbsp;</strong>According to CNBC, “When the clean energy tax credits phase out at the end of 2025, that will bump up electricity costs for ordinary Americans, Orvis says. That’s largely because higher costs for clean energy development will slow the pace of new supply, just as U.S. energy demand hits record highs, he says, resulting in higher electricity bills and increased reliance on natural gas, which will also become more expensive with rising demand.” [CNBC, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/14/how-much-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-could-raise-electricity-costs.html">7/15/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>The Average Iowa Household Was Expected To Pay An Additional $350 Dollars In Energy Costs Due To The Reconciliation Bill.&nbsp;</strong>According to CNBC, “Here’s how much more households in every state could pay annually, on average, by 2035, due to changes in energy policies under the “big beautiful” bill, according to Energy Innovation’s research. […] Iowa: $350” [CNBC, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/14/how-much-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-could-raise-electricity-costs.html">7/15/25</a>]</p>
<h4>The “One Big Beautiful Bill” Created Uncertainty In Iowa’s Wind Industry&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>The Reconciliation Bill Would Make New Wind Energy Development Less Financially Viable And Slow It’s Growth.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Gazette, “Republicans’ tax and spending law rolls back clean-energy tax credits for wind projects, significantly reducing future financial support. While construction can continue until mid-2026 for some projects, facilities placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027 will lose eligibility for these credits, making new wind energy development less financially viable and potentially slowing its growth.” [Gazette, <a href="https://www.thegazette.com/federal-government/iowas-ashley-hinson-touts-gop-energy-policies-backs-immigration-crackdown/">8/28/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>The Clawing Back Of Wind Energy Credits Was Described As Creating Uncertainty For Project Developers And Raising Costs.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Iowa Capital Dispatch, “Costa, during a Thursday press conference with Climate Power, said the bill ‘really radically’ changes how clean electricity developers can plan and develop their projects, by eliminating the ability to ‘lock in’ a tax treatment at the start of construction. ‘This is going to create a lot of uncertainty for project developers,’ Costa said. ‘It’s going to raise financing costs for project developers pretty considerably … but it also just means that fewer projects will end up qualifying for the credits.’” [Iowa Capital Dispatch, <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/06/06/clean-energy-tax-cuts-in-reconciliation-budget-would-stall-renewable-energy-projects-in-iowa/">6/6/25</a>]</p>
