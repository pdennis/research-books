# How To Win Against Ashley Hinson

Ashley Hinson betrayed Iowans by voting for devastating healthcare cuts, ripping away food assistance, and voting to end energy credits that supported Iowa’s energy sector. Hinson attacked healthcare systems that supported rural Iowans and championed tariffs that harmed Iowan families. Are we surprised that she was being booed by her constituents?

### Hinson Voted For Devastating Health Care Cuts

-   Hinson betrayed Iowans by [**voting**](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that is estimated to kick [**17 million Americans**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including nearly [**12 million Americans**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) who rely on Medicaid. Over [86,000](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/22/iowa-impact-of-congress-budget-cuts-to-medicaid-snap/83742388007/) Iowans could lose their health insurance as a result of her vote. Hinson was met with a [chorus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/29/one-big-beautiful-bill-republican-lawmakers-ashley-hinson-trump/) of boos from upset Iowans when she touted the legislation and it’s cuts.

**Message:** Hinson betrayed Iowans by voting to take health care away from Iowans all to fund billionaire tax breaks.

### Hinson Opposed Expanding And Protecting Healthcare Coverage

-   Hinson opposed expanding Medicare coverage, claiming that it was “[socialism](https://iowastartingline.com/2021/09/27/mathis-criticizes-hinson-for-medicare-expansion-socialism-comments/).” Hinson [twice](https://iowastartingline.com/2022/04/03/hinson-feenstra-vote-against-insulin-price-cap-axne-and-miller-meeks-support/) [voted](https://iowastartingline.com/2022/08/16/ashley-hinson-voted-against-insulin-caps-because-republicans/) against capping insulin prices for seniors.
-   Hinson [opposed](https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/12/03/iowa-u-s-house-delegation-largely-wary-of-extending-health-care-tax-credits/) extending ACA subsidies and called the ACA, the “[unaffordable care act](https://www.radioiowa.com/2025/11/05/hinson-says-aca-subsidies-mask-cost-of-insurance/).” Without extending the ACA subsidies, Iowans could face over [$1 thousand](https://www.axios.com/local/des-moines/2025/11/24/iowa-health-cost-premiums-nunn-aca-obamacare) monthly health insurance hike and would hit [rural Iowa hard](https://www.radioiowa.com/2025/12/16/iowa-farmers-union-says-end-of-aca-tax-credits-a-huge-hit-to-rural-america/).

**Message:** Hinson betrayed Iowans by refusing to extend and protect Iowan’s healthcare.

### Hinson Voted To Take Food Assistance From Iowans

-   Hinson [voted](https://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that made the [largest SNAP cut](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-senate-republican-leaderships-reconciliation-bill-takes) in history. More than [260,000](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/22/iowa-impact-of-congress-budget-cuts-to-medicaid-snap/83742388007/) Iowans rely on SNAP to afford groceries. Hinson said that the legislation should’ve done “[further cuts](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/ashley-hinson-fox-news-rundown-6425/s-SgRg9XC8GmB?si=3b0a846e0ae049a5961a69c22c373aac&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing).”

-   As a result of Trump’s trade war, China had [**stopped buying Americans soybeans**](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/business/china-us-soybeans-farming.html) and instead [**started buying them from Brazil**](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-misses-out-billions-dollars-china-soybean-sales-midway-through-peak-season-2025-09-10/). China had previously been the [**biggest buyer**](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/the-american-farmers-china-is-using-as-a-trade-war-bargaining-chip-134c2cda?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAim6K_ctW7ArWM9H6fc_WMa3BuzkmnO1jk_Gc3V0CbMeWyyd1kdeiVJGKHZ73M%3D&gaa_ts=68cc4400&gaa_sig=a7zuiQ_nXRNWx5AM9EsmgKrpRrZEa7Quu2sP9yd5RR5WSyKuJld_wSYsuOip6gkZwbwixDT4bJjsGn-_hMlecQ%3D%3D) of American soybeans.

**Message:** Hinson is siding with Trump’s trade war and is choosing higher prices and hurting Iowa’s access to global market over protecting affordability and Iowans’ livelihoods. 

### Hinson Voted Against Protecting Iowans’ Clean Energy Jobs

-   Hinson [voted](https://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) [multiple](https://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll199.xml) times to repeal clean energy tax credits which would harm Iowans’ clean energy jobs. Hinson’s vote [threatened](https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/06/06/clean-energy-tax-cuts-in-reconciliation-budget-would-stall-renewable-energy-projects-in-iowa/) clean jobs in her state and could cause Iowan families to [pay $350 more in energy bills](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/14/how-much-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-could-raise-electricity-costs.html).

**Message:** Hinson voted against protecting Iowans’ clean energy jobs to give tax breaks to billionaires.

### Hinson Defended Cuts That Threatened Social Security, Iowan’s Livelihood And Iowa’s Economy

-   Hinson [defended](https://www.iowapublicradio.org/ipr-news/2025-04-25/republican-rep-ashley-hinson-doge-deportations-tariffs-mason-city-town-hall) the “Department of Government Efficiency” and was a [member](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/iowas-hinson-defends-doge-fields-questions-on-tariffs-egg-prices-and-social-security/) of the DOGE caucus. DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) ability to [deliver](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) services to seniors. More than [701,239 Iowans](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/ia.pdf) relied on Social Security benefits.
-   DOGE-driven cuts were making it [difficult](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/iowa-rep-ashley-hinson-will-still-hold-town-halls-despite-gop-advice-not-to/) for Iowa veterans to receive care. DOGE-driven cuts led to [layoffs](https://www.weareiowa.com/article/news/local/doge-federal-funding-cuts-trump-americorps-iowa-seed-coalition-impact/524-cf96270c-860c-4f1a-9cc0-b145c608f425)[across](https://cbs2iowa.com/news/local/seven-federal-offices-closing-in-iowa-under-doge-cuts-but-savings-remain-unclear)[Iowa](https://www.kcrg.com/2025/02/20/fired-federal-employees-iowa-warn-bigger-economic-impacts/). DOGE-driven cuts led to [cancelled grants](https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/09/16/federal-research-funding-canceled-in-iowa-includes-medical-student-driven-studies/) for research in Iowa’s higher educational institutions.

**Message:** Hinson cheered cuts that meant slower services, loss of jobs, and a worse economy.
