# **How To Win Against Ryan Mackenzie**

Mackenzie is a MAGA-aligned partisan posing as a pragmatist. He backed ripping health coverage from thousands of Pennsylvanians, opposed making prescription drugs cheaper for Lehigh Valley seniors, was the deciding vote to protect Trump’s tariffs even as local workers got pink slips, and got caught lying to women in his own community. Add in his anti-choice extremism and the picture is clear: Mackenzie is not the independent voice Lehigh Valley deserves, he’s just another embarrassing partisan clown.

### **MACKENZIE VOTED FOR DEVASTATING HEALTH CARE CUTS**

-   Mackenzie [_voted_](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that would kick [_17 million Americans_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including nearly [_12 million Americans_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off of Medicaid. Then he claimed the bill was an [_“unprecedented win for workers.”_](https://mackenzie.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-mackenzie-highlights-obbb-benefits-small-businesses-service) More than [_26,000 Pennsylvanians_](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) in his district could lose their health coverage as a result of his vote.
-   Mackenzie, who has [_previously criticized_](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/21/trumps-big-test-will-his-swing-voters-stay-loyal) Congress for failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also hosted Speaker Mike Johnson at a campaign event, when Johnson [_pledged_](https://www.salon.com/2024/10/31/mike-johnson-pledges-to-scrap-if-wins-saying-it-will-be-a-big-part-of-the-agenda/) to get rid of the ACA.

**Message:** Mackenzie voted to rip health care from thousands of Pennsylvanians so he could give billionaires tax breaks. 

### **MACKENZIE DEFENDED CUTS TO MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY**

-   Mackenzie [_promised_](https://www.easternprogress.com/we-want-his-hands-off-our-social-security-hundreds-protest-trump-administration-in-bethlehem-twp/article_b7c3eb66-c385-50d0-8b56-4b66099a3149.html) that he would protect Social Security and said he was “[very clear](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/ryan-mackenzie-tele-town-hall-3202025/s-7AxCkqQBV19?si=eeafd063daac4f3c9d0ede4dd59da590&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)” that he would not change Medicare, but then he [_voted_](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml) for a bill that would [_trigger $500 billion in cuts to Medicare_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/). Then he claimed the bill delivered [_“real relief for seniors.”_](https://mackenzie.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-mackenzie-applauds-passage-budget-reconciliation-bill)
-   Mackenzie also [_defended_](https://www.lehighvalleynews.com/elections/u-s-rep-ryan-mackenzie-sticks-up-for-trump-musk-on-national-stage-in-cnn-town-hall) Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” as DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [_affecting_](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [_federal government’s_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) ability to [_deliver services_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. More than [_180,000 Pennsylvanians_](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/pa.pdf) in Mackenzie’s district relied on Social Security benefits.

**Message:** Mackenzie broke his promises to Pennsylvania seniors so he could appease Trump and give billionaires tax breaks.  

### **MACKENZIE SIDED WITH BIG PHARMA OVER PENNSYLVANIANS**

-   Mackenzie [_opposed_](https://www.mcall.com/2024/10/08/your-view-from-ryan-mackenzie-government-spending-failed-to-help-most-americans/) the Inflation Reduction Act, which [_lowered prescription drug costs_](https://www.hhs.gov/inflation-reduction-act/index.html) and [_capped the cost of insulin at $35/month_](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-facts-about-the-35-insulin-copay-cap-in-medicare/) for seniors. More than [_450,000 Pennsylvanians_](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ira-rx-prices-pennsylvania.pdf) took prescription drugs that had been selected for price negotiation under the law’s provisions.

**Message:** Mackenzie sided with big pharma over cheaper prescription drugs for Pennsylvanians. 

### **MACKENZIE WAS THE DECIDING VOTE TO PROTECT TRUMP’S TARIFFS THAT LAID OFF PENNSYLVANIANS** 

-   Mackenzie [_defended_](https://www.lehighvalleynews.com/elections/u-s-rep-ryan-mackenzie-sticks-up-for-trump-musk-on-national-stage-in-cnn-town-hall) Trump’s tariffs and claimed they were a [good concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18u-Vsl365E). Then, he voted four times to protect the tariffs, including in April 2025 when he was the [_deciding vote_](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect them, dooming Pennsylvania families who relied on him to a [_trade war_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/06/trump-tariffs-layofffs-voters-pennsylvania/) and rising prices. Tariffs are contributing to [_higher food prices_](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi) and Pennsylvania businesses are [_warning_](https://6abc.com/post/trump-tariffs-small-businesses-warn-price-hike-everyday-items-food-electronics-alcohol/17432575/) they may have to [_raise prices_](https://pennsylvaniaindependent.com/economy/what-trump-tariffs-mean-for-pennsylvania-breweries/).
-   When Mack Trucks announced that it would be [_laying off hundreds_](https://penncapital-star.com/briefs/mack-trucks-announces-layoffs-at-lehigh-valley-plant-blames-tariffs/) of workers at its Lehigh Valley operations center as a result of the tariffs, instead of standing up to Trump and calling to stop the tariffs, Mackenzie [_criticized_](https://www.lehighvalleynews.com/business/mack-trucks-to-lay-off-hundreds-of-lehigh-valley-workers-state-representative-says) the company that was struggling from the uncertainty of Trump’s policies.

**Message:** Mackenzie left Pennsylvanians behind as Trump’s tariffs took their jobs and made groceries more expensive.  

### It took mackenzie 11 months to vote to release the epstein files and he did only after trump gave house republicans permission

-   In November 2025, after 11 months, Mackenzie finally [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml) to release the Epstein files, but only after [Donald Trump gave House Republicans permission](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115562626931599548) to do so. Previously, Mackenzie had [cast the deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml) against [releasing the Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj), protecting the accused pedophiles named within them. Mackenzie never [signed](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209) the discharge petition that called for their release and he never [co-sponsored](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581/cosponsors?pageSort=alphaByParty) Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna’s resolution calling for their release. 

**Message:** It took Mackenzie 11 months to vote to release the Epstein files and he did only after Trump signaled to House Republicans that he approved. 

### **MACKENZIE GOT CAUGHT LYING ON A DATING APP**

-   In 2020, Mackenzie [_claimed_](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13530821/gop-candidate-state-representative-ryan-mackenzie-lied-tinder-profile.html) to be 29 years-old in his Tinder profile when he was really 37 years-old.
-   When this gained national attention in 2024, 100 of Mackenzie’s female constituents [_wrote to him_](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13564767/100-women-ryan-mackenzie-exposed-lying-age-tinder.html) demanding he apologize. Mackenzie did not apologize and instead [_accused_](https://www.newsnationnow.com/on-balance-with-leland-vittert/pennsylvania-ryan-mackenzie-tinder/) the women of being “Democrat operatives” even though a majority of the women who signed the letter were [_employed outside of politics_](https://keystonenewsroom.com/2024/08/27/ryan-mackenzie-tinder-questions/).

**Message:** If Mackenzie will lie to women on a dating app, why trust him with your health care, your job, or your vote.
