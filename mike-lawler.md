# **How To Win Against Mike Lawler**

Mike Lawler sells a moderate brand, but he is a far-right [_gaslighter_](https://x.com/American_Bridge/status/1942589132578119738) when it matters. He backed the largest Medicaid cut in history to fund tax cuts for billionaires after repeatedly promising the opposite, defended Trump’s tariffs even while admitting they’d hurt New Yorkers, cheered a plan that hollowed out Social Security service, came up short on tax relief for New Yorkers, and demonstrated poor judgement. New Yorkers deserve serious representation, not an embarrassing clown. 

### **LAWLER PROMISED TO PROTECT HEALTH CARE, THEN VOTED FOR DEVASTATING CUTS**

-   Lawler [_repeatedly_](https://soundcloud.com/sarah-holland129922/mike-lawler-the-fox-news-rundown-4222025/s-RYI2zZr2gcO?si=5bd1f776d54a4ff7887f6313afe8514e&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) [_promised_](https://soundcloud.com/sarah-holland129922/mike-lawler-tele-town-hall-3192025/s-Dd4Bv04QULL?si=c9956eadd26c4b029a561e86d8aaa171) that he [_would not_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=metN_0O1MpM) [_cut Medicaid_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV73UnE0Wao), even at one point saying he was [_“very clear”_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1MqmiOaKqk&list=PLWuvMonaruUjVKsh34r0qO45F9qNd_lgA&index=9) that he would “not support any proposal that cuts benefits or reduces services for Medicare or Medicaid.”
-   Then, Lawler [_voted_](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that would kick [_17 million Americans_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including [_nearly 12 million Americans_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off of Medicaid. More than [_32,000 New Yorkers_](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) in his district could lose their health coverage as a result of his vote. Lawler put hospitals in his district that relied significantly on Medicaid funding [_at-risk_](https://fiscalpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025.06.27-hospital-closures-FINAL.pdf), including the [_Montefiore Nyack Hospital_](https://x.com/American_Bridge/status/1954672947123106027) and Westchester Medical Center.

**Message:** Lawler promised to protect New Yorkers’ health coverage and access to care, then voted to gut it to give tax breaks to billionaires. 

### lawler promised he would protect medicare, then he voted for massive cuts

-   Lawler repeatedly made it “very clear” to New Yorkers that he would not cut Medicare. Then, he [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll145.xml) for a bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would result in [nearly $500 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare, absent future congressional action. 

**Message:** Lawler broke his promised to protect Medicare from cuts all to give tax breaks to billionaires. 

### Lawler Promised he would protect food assistance, then voted to cut it

- Lawler promised loud and clear that he would not cut SNAP benefits. Then, he [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that made the [largest SNAP cut in history.](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-senate-republican-leaderships-reconciliation-bill-takes) [More than 18,000 New Yorkers](https://www.fns.usda.gov/data-research/data-visualization/snap-community-characteristics-congressional-district-dashboard) in his district relied on SNAP to be able to afford groceries.

**Message:** Lawler broke his promise to protect food assistance, all to give tax cuts to billionaires. 

### **LAWLER DEFENDED TRUMP’S TARIFFS AT NEW YORKERS’ EXPENSE**

-   Lawler has [_repeatedly_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjvpBmraipg&list=PLWuvMonaruUjVKsh34r0qO45F9qNd_lgA&index=11) [_defended_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5uVeAuCYC0&list=PLWuvMonaruUjVKsh34r0qO45F9qNd_lgA&index=4) Trump’s tariffs despite also acknowledging they would cause [_pain_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbViT8A03pY&list=PLWuvMonaruUjVKsh34r0qO45F9qNd_lgA&index=5). He claimed they were “very effective” and that paired with Republicans’ tax giveaways to the wealthy they would cause the economy to [_“take off.”_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5uVeAuCYC0)
-   Then, he voted four times to protect the tariffs, including in April 2025 when he was the [_deciding vote_](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect them, dooming New Jersey families who relied on him to a [_trade war_](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/trump-tariffs-small-business-nyc-prices) and [_rising prices_](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/politics/2025/08/12/n-y--businesses-brace-for-impacts-of-u-s--tariffs). Tariffs are contributing to [_higher food prices_](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/09/16/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices-rise-cpi) and pain for [_business owners_](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/politics/2025/08/12/n-y--businesses-brace-for-impacts-of-u-s--tariffs).

**Message:** Lawler is fine with New Yorkers paying more for groceries and everything else if it's what Trump wants.   

### **LAWLER DEFENDED ATTACKS ON SOCIAL SECURITY**

-   Lawler defended Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” claiming it was [_“necessary”_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV408Y3asNc&list=PLWuvMonaruUjVKsh34r0qO45F9qNd_lgA&index=8) as DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [_affecting_](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [_federal government’s_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) ability to [_deliver services_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. More than [_145,000 New Yorkers_](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/ny.pdf) in Lawler’s district relied on Social Security benefits.

**Message:** Lawler talks about protecting New York seniors, but didn’t stop Trump’s attacks on Social Security.

### **LAWLER TALKED TOUGH ON SALT, BUT CAME UP SHORT**

-   Lawler [_promised_](https://lawler.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3600) New Yorkers that he would raise the SALT deduction to $100,000. In the end, he came up short with only a $40,000 [_temporary_](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/how-would-the-2025-house-tax-bill-change-the-salt-deduction/) deduction.

**Message:** Lawler promised New Yorkers $100,000 in tax relief, but came up short. 

### it took lawler 11 months to vote to release the epstein files and he did only after trump gave republicans permission

-   In November 2025, after 11 months, Lawler finally [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml) to release the Epstein files, but only after [Donald Trump gave House Republicans permission](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115562626931599548) to do so. Previously, Lawer had [cast the deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml) against [releasing the Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj), protecting the accused pedophiles named within them. Lawler had even been [dismissive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuqYtNE2nXI) about the importance of releasing the Epstein files. Lawler never [signed](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209) the discharge petition that called for their release and he never [co-sponsored](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581/cosponsors?pageSort=alphaByParty) Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna’s resolution calling for their release. 

**Message:** It took Lawler, who had been dismissive in the past about the importance of releasing the Epstein files, 11 months to vote to do so and he did only after Trump gave Republicans permission. 

### **LAWLER WORE BLACKFACE**

-   When Lawler was in college he was [_photographed wearing blackface_](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/nyregion/lawler-blackface-michael-jackson.html) as part of a [_Michael Jackson costume_](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/04/mike-lawler-blackface-new-york-00182489). He attended Manhattan College where only three percent of the students were Black and reportedly used bronzer to darken his face for the costume.
-   Lawler apologized but claimed his actions were the “sincerest form of flattery” and a “genuine homage to \[his\] musical hero.” Lawler then tried to [_make jokes_](https://x.com/American_Bridge/status/1849255445862490441) about his actions.
-   Lawler had an oddly strong obsession with Michael Jackson. It was reported that in 2005 he [_flew to California_](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/nyregion/lawler-blackface-michael-jackson.html) to attend part of Michael Jackson’s criminal trial over accusations Jackson molested a young boy. Lawler was [_reportedly_](https://www.thedailybeast.com/gop-rep-mike-lawler-cant-let-go-of-his-michael-jackson-fandom/) “so disgusted” by the testimony against Jackson that he “couldn’t help but mutter something derogatory under his breath” and was removed from the courtroom.

**Message:** Lawler demonstrated bad judgement and embarrassed New Yorkers with his antics.
