# How To Win Against Eli Crane

Eli Crane is out-of-touch with his constituents because he doesn’t live in the district he represents. He voted to cut critical health insurance programs and raise costs for Arizonans. He backed legislation that threatened the Medicaid benefits of more than 41,000 Arizonans in his district. He repeatedly praised Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) despite the risk it posed to his constituent’s Social Security benefits. He supported Trump’s tariffs that were hurting small businesses and were raising grocery prices. Crane has even [admitted](https://x.com/American_Bridge/status/1827040986490437781?s=20) that he isn’t a good congressman.  

### Crane Voted To Take Health Insurance Away From Arizonans Who Relied On Medicaid

-   Crane [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that was estimated to kick [17 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance including nearly 12 million Americans who rely on Medicaid. [More than 41,000 Arizonans](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) could lose their health insurance as a result of Crane’s votes. Navajo leaders also [warned](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/native-americans-federal-health-cuts-rfk-jr-promise-indian-health-service/) that cuts would directly threaten the health care coverage of many Native Americans, which made up [18% of Crane's district](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2024/11/04/native-american-voters-power-2024-presidential-election/). Crane even [admitted](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/eli-crane-tele-town-hall-7222025/s-u7SHKyfHeCu?si=8921cb8f08064e4faae33e95c6444a52&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) the bill he voted for cut Medicaid after months of claiming Republicans were only tackling [“waste, fraud, and abuse.”](https://x.com/RepEliCrane/status/1895288093621748111)

**Message:** Crane voted to cut health care for thousands of Arizonans all to fund tax cuts for billionaires. 

### Crane Voted For The House GOP Reconciliation Bill, Which Would Trigger $500 Billion In Cuts To Medicare

-   Crane [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll190.xml) for a bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would trigger [nearly $500 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare.

**Message:** Crane voted to cut health care services for seniors all to fund tax cuts for billionaires. 

### Crane Backed DOGE Despite The Harm It Was Causing To The Social Security Administration

-   Crane [defended](https://x.com/RepEliCrane/status/1890430800694239361) Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” even as DOGE cuts were harming Americans’ ability to access the [Social Security Administration](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/25/social-security-phones-doge-cuts/). More than [225,000 Arizonans](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/az.pdf) in the second congressional district relied on Social Security benefits.

**Message:** Crane supported DOGE despite the threat it posed to his constituents’ Social Security benefits.

### Crane Was The Deciding Vote To Protect Trump’s Tariffs That Were Making Life More Expensive For Arizonans 

-   Despite the negative impact on Arizonans, Crane [defended](https://x.com/EliCrane_CEO/status/1906739364240978298) Trump’s tariffs. Crane voted four times to protect Trump’s tariffs, despite the pain the tariffs were bringing to Arizonans. In April 2025, he was even the [deciding vote](https://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll094.xml) to protect them. Tariffs were contributing to higher food prices, were [hurting](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/05/02/phoenix-toy-store-bracing-trumps-china-tariffs-impact-pricing-supply/) Arizona [businesses](https://www.kgun9.com/news/community-inspired-journalism/eastside-news/tucson-toy-and-game-stores-brace-for-uncertainty-amid-tariffs) and [farmers](https://www.abc15.com/news/state/it-could-break-us-valley-farmer-says-chinese-tariffs-have-crushed-the-alfalfa-export-market), and could [increase car insurance rates](https://www.axios.com/local/phoenix/2025/08/07/arizona-car-insurance-rates-tariffs).

**Message:** Crane was the deciding vote to make Arizonans pay higher prices for necessities like groceries and car insurance.   

### Crane Was A Danger To Women's Health And Freedoms

-   Crane [praised](https://x.com/EliCrane_CEO/status/1433484576941219875) a six week abortion ban in Texas and said he [opposed](https://web.archive.org/web/20220726192354/https:/www.azvoterguide.com/candidate/us-house/crane-eli/) abortions, even in the case of rape or incest. Crane called Roe. V. Wade a [“mistake”](https://eliforarizona.com/eli-crane-statement-on-roe-v-wade/) and celebrated when it was overturned by the Supreme Court.
-   Crane voted several times to restrict reproductive freedom. Crane voted to restrict [service members’](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll400.xml) ability to travel to access reproductive care and voted to prohibit [Department of Veterans’ Affairs](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll380.xml) funds from being used for abortion services. He also voted to restrict access to [Mifepristone](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll507.xml).

**Message:** Crane was a threat to women’s freedom and health. 

### Despite Calling For The Release Of The Epstein Files, It Took Crane 11 Months To Vote To Release Them

-   In November 2025, after 11 months, Crane finally [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll289.xml) to release the Epstein files, but only after [Donald Trump gave House Republicans permission](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115562626931599548) to do so. Previously, Crane had [cast the deciding vote](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2025/roll194.xml) against [releasing the Epstein files](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/15/epstein-house-democrats-republicans-trump-doj), protecting the accused pedophiles named within them even though he [claimed](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/86013894-63b7-46b8-a749-4b930d7a39e8/s-u4fuH6dEF5U?si=065fefef2b314d7e9c2a12e7cada9cca&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) he was passionate about releasing the files and that transparency should be the hallmark of any administration. Crane did [co-sponsor](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/581/cosponsors?pageSort=alphaByParty) Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna’s resolution calling for their release, but he never [signed](https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2025090209) the discharge petition that brought that resolution to the House floor for a vote.

**Message:** Crane was a hypocrite who preached one thing than did another. He told Arizonans he supported releasing the Epstein Files, then it took him 11 months to vote to release them and he did only after Trump gave Republicans permission.  

### Crane Referred To African Americans As “Colored People” On The House Floor

-   In 2023, Crane used the term [“colored people”](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4096840-arizona-republicans-colored-people-remark-draws-floor-rebuke/https:/thehill.com/homenews/house/4096840-arizona-republicans-colored-people-remark-draws-floor-rebuke/) to refer to African Americans while speaking on the House floor and was consequently reprimanded for his language. Crane claimed he [“misspoke.”](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eli-crane-colored-people-remark-house-floor/https:/www.cbsnews.com/news/eli-crane-colored-people-remark-house-floor/)

**Message:** Crane cannot be trusted to represent all of his district because he doesn’t seem to view all his constituents as equal. 

### Crane’s Current Residence Was Not In Arizona’s Second District, The District He Represented In Congress

-   [Property records](https://pimacountyaz-web.tylerhost.net/web/document/DOCC8847508?search=DOCSEARCH55S6) and [campaign finance reports](https://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/303/202110159467738303/202110159467738303.pdf) showed that Crane’s primary address was not in the district he represented, but rather [Rep. Juan Ciscomani’s district](https://ziplook.house.gov/htbin/findrep_house?ADDRLK60495111060495111).
-   Crane did not have property in the district he represented, despite being worth almost $2 million.

**Message:** Crane did not care enough about the district he represented to actually live in it.
