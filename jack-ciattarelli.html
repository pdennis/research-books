<h2>Political Vulnerabilities</h2>
<h3><strong>Ciattarelli Is An Anti-Abortion Extremist</strong></h3>
<p>Ciattarelli claimed to take a “libertarian” approach to abortion rights, but ultimately supported a 20-week abortion ban, claiming that was when fetuses began to feel pain. He also opposed state funding of Planned Parenthood, and instead uplifted anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers. Ciattarelli opposed both the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act and the first version of abortion rights legislation, the Reproductive Freedom Act. Ciattarelli called the Reproductive Freedom Act “extreme,” comparing it to extreme abortion bans, and “radical” for easing restrictions on abortion and expanding access to abortion providers.</p>
<h3><strong>CIATTARELLI CALLED TO REPEAL AND REPLACE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND DESCRIBED MEDICAID CUTS AS A “GRAND EXPERIMENT”</strong></h3>
<p>During his 2017 and 2021 gubernatorial campaigns, Jack Ciattarelli’s health care proposals included repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act and supporting programs that were vague, ineffective, or already implemented in New Jersey or nationwide. Despite receiving criticism for these proposals, Ciattarelli maintained many of them in his 2025 gubernatorial campaign platform.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ciattarelli supported replacing New Jersey’s health exchange with a “free-market health system,” including “catastrophic-coverage insurance plans” despite them being banned in New Jersey. Catastrophic health care plans were “bare-bones plans” that had high deductibles and caused patients to delay care.</li>
  <li>Ciattarelli supported health insurance programs that were already implemented by the Affordable Care Act or Governor Murphy. New Jersey Spotlight News previously criticized Ciattarelli’s health care plans after his campaign declined to provide details and failed to clarify how his policies differed to existing health care programs.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Ciattarelli called Medicaid and Medicare cuts “a grand experiment” in 2025 despite previously acknowledging the harm it would cause to New Jerseyans.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ciattarelli Wanted To Slash Pension Benefits</h3>
<p>Ciattarelli claimed he supported cost-of-living-adjustments for first responder retirees, but he previously called for the state to skip one year’s pension payment. Additionally, Ciattarelli claimed state worker’s post-retirement benefits were too “generous,” called for the slashing of state workers’ post-retirement benefits, and wanted to turn the pension system into a “cash balance plan.”</p>
<h3>Ciattarelli&nbsp;Planned To Defund Public Schools</h3>
<p>Ciattarelli’s 2021 property tax plan proposed diverting education funding away from urban schools to suburban, shore area, and rural schools. Critics warned that taking funding from schools in poor cities would increase racial and economic divides that already existed in New Jersey.</p>
<h3>Ciattarelli&nbsp;Was Paid To Downplay Opioid Risks</h3>
<p>Ciattarelli’s Galen Publishing was paid $12.2 million to publish content that downplayed the risks of opioid abuse using pharmaceutical industry-funded grants.&nbsp;</p>
