Rep. Chuck Edwards was officially sanctioned by the House for misusing government resources in his email newsletters. House rules clearly ban members from using taxpayer-funded resources for political or campaign-style messages or for attacking others. The bipartisan House Communications Standards Commission found in April 2024 that Edwards broke these rules by sending official emails that included personal attacks on President Biden and his son. Because the messages didn’t cost postage, his penalty was a written warning and mandatory training—the standard punishment for a first, no-cost violation.

### House rules bar using official resources and communications for politicized or disparaging content
- The House Ethics Manual states that official resources must be used only for the performance of official House business and may not be used for campaign or political purposes. ([ethics.house.gov](https://ethics.house.gov/manual/general-prohibition-against-using-official-resources-for-campaign-or-political-purposes/))
- The House Communications Standards Manual requires that official communications be used only for official congressional business and “may not be used to disparage Members, other individuals or political parties,” prohibiting personalized/politicized attacks. ([democrats-cha.house.gov](https://democrats-cha.house.gov/communications-standard-commission/communications-guidelines/communications-content-rules-purple))
- Expenditures from Members’ Representational Allowances and official communications are governed by House rules and may not be used for campaign or political activity.

### The House Communications Standards Commission (HCSC) is the official body that investigates and sanctions violations of communications rules
- Federal law (2 U.S.C. § 501) establishes the House Communications Standards Commission and authorizes it to enforce House communications standards and related rules. ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/501))
- The Committee on House Administration explains that the HCSC issues regulations, provides advisory opinions, and hears formal complaints alleging violations by Members. ([cha.house.gov](https://cha.house.gov/about-the-commission))
- HCSC rules require written decisions and public release, and set penalties; for no‑cost violations, a first offense results in a written warning and mandatory training. ([cha.house.gov](https://cha.house.gov/rules-test))

### The Commission found and sanctioned Rep. Chuck Edwards for violating those rules in April 2024
- On April 24, 2024, the HCSC unanimously found “substantial reason to believe” a violation occurred regarding Edwards’ 2023 email newsletters and stated that penalties were issued.

- Blue Ridge Public Radio reported that Edwards “was sanctioned” after the Commission found he violated House rules by using taxpayer resources/franking privileges unrelated to official duties; because the communications were emails, there was no postal cost and thus no fine.

- Under House rules, the first‑violation penalty is a written warning and mandatory training, which aligns with how no‑cost violations are handled. ([cha.house.gov](https://cha.house.gov/rules-test))

### Edwards’ emails reflect the kind of misuse the rules forbid
- The sanction stemmed from official mass email newsletters that included personal attacks on President Joe Biden and his son—content the Communications Standards Manual forbids in official communications.

- Using taxpayer‑funded official communications for partisan or campaign‑style attacks constitutes misuse of official resources under House ethics guidance.
