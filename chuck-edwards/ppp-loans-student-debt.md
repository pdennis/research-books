Rep. Chuck Edwards’ company, C. Edwards Group Inc., received a $1.12 million Paycheck Protection Program loan in April 2020 that was fully forgiven, covering his McDonald’s franchises in western North Carolina. As a state senator, he later sponsored a bill letting businesses deduct expenses paid with forgiven PPP loans—a move estimated to save his own company $40,000 to $50,000 in taxes. But once in Congress, Edwards voted twice to block federal student-debt relief programs and publicly called President Biden’s forgiveness plan “unfair,” even though he personally benefited from over a million dollars in forgiven government-backed loans.
