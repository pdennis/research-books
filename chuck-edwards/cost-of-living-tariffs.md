In 2025, Congressman Chuck Edwards publicly backed President Trump’s new tariffs, telling business owners to “give tariffs a chance” and defending them as a smart way to negotiate with other countries. But these tariffs have made life more expensive for Americans. The White House doubled taxes on imported steel and aluminum, which raised costs for U.S. manufacturers and consumers. Studies by the U.S. International Trade Commission and the Congressional Budget Office found that nearly all of these costs were passed on to Americans, increasing inflation and cutting household buying power. Research from the Federal Reserve and others also shows that similar tariffs in past years led to higher prices, lost manufacturing jobs, and weaker local economies—especially in areas that rely on trade and factory work.

### Edwards  publicly supported President Trump’s tariff policy
- On April 8, 2025, Edwards told a room of business owners he supports the president’s tariff approach and urged Americans to “give tariffs a chance.” ([ncnewsline.com](https://ncnewsline.com/2025/04/08/nc-congressman-defends-trump-urges-business-owners-to-give-tariffs-a-chance/))
- At a March 13, 2025 Asheville town hall, Edwards defended Trump’s use of tariffs as a negotiating tactic and largely aligned himself with the administration’s policies. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/ba90438a9265bc868cf1e3ade150a943))

### The tariffs Edwards backs were imposed in 2025 and materially raise U.S. prices
- On June 3, 2025, the White House formally doubled Section 232 duties to 50% on steel and aluminum, broadening tariff coverage and raising input costs for U.S. manufacturers and consumers. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/adjusting-imports-of-aluminum-and-steel-into-the-united-states/))
- The U.S. International Trade Commission found importers bore nearly all Section 232/301 tariff costs; prices rose roughly one-for-one with tariff rates, and downstream U.S. industries faced higher prices and reduced output. ([usitc.gov](https://www.usitc.gov/press_room/news_release/2023/er0315_63679.htm))
- The Congressional Budget Office estimated Trump’s 2025 tariff package would raise average U.S. inflation by about 0.4 percentage points in 2025–2026 and erode household purchasing power. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-congress-budget-office-sees-economic-output-falling-trump-tariffs-2025-06-04/))
- Peer‑reviewed research on the 2018–2019 tariff episode found complete pass‑through of tariffs to U.S. import prices and higher prices for intermediates and final goods borne by U.S. consumers and firms. ([ideas.repec.org](https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/jecper/v33y2019i4p187-210.html))

### Tariffs of the type Edwards supports destroy jobs or put large numbers of U.S. jobs at risk
- Federal Reserve research shows industries more exposed to tariff increases experienced relative reductions in manufacturing employment and higher producer prices; counties more exposed to rising tariffs saw higher unemployment and lower labor‑force participation. ([federalreserve.gov](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/disentangling-the-effects-of-the-2018-2019-tariffs-on-a-globally-connected-us-manufacturing-sector.htm))
- The USITC reported Section 232 tariffs raised input costs and reduced production across downstream U.S. industries, conditions associated with job losses in affected sectors. ([usitc.gov](https://www.usitc.gov/press_room/news_release/2023/er0315_63679.htm))
- Independent macro analysis of the 2018–2019 tariffs found U.S. tradeable‑sector workers—especially in heavily Republican counties—were most negatively affected amid retaliatory tariffs, consistent with employment losses. ([nber.org](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25638))
- With Trump’s 2025 tariff escalation, the U.S.–China Business Council warned that continued tit‑for‑tat measures threaten U.S. exports worth $140.7 billion and put an estimated 862,000 American jobs at risk.
