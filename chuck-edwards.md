# Rep. Chuck Edwards' Policies Have Harmed Everyday People

- [:shopping_cart: *Backed Tariffs That Raise Prices And Threaten North Carolina Jobs*](/chuck-edwards/cost-of-living-tariffs) Edwards has cheered on Trump’s 2025 tariff hikes, even as economists and CBO say they raise prices for families and put export and manufacturing jobs at risk.
- [:no_entry_sign: *Cut Health Care*](/chuck-edwards/medicaid-work-requirements) He twice voted for federal bills that write strict Medicaid paperwork rules into law, despite independent estimates that millions would lose coverage with no employment gains.
- [:bank: *Can't Be Trusted To Protect Social Security*](/chuck-edwards/social-security-cuts) As a member of the Republican Study Committee, Edwards is aligned with plans to raise the retirement age and cut future benefits, while saying “changes” for younger workers may be necessary.
- [:hospital: *Can't Be Trusted To Protect Medicare*](/chuck-edwards/medicare-cuts) He supported a reconciliation bill that delays Medicare drug negotiations, increases deficits, and triggers automatic Medicare cut threats unless Congress later passes a fix.

# Rep. Chuck Edwards Used His Office To Benefit Himself And His Donors

- [:money_with_wings: *Took Taxpayer Loans While Fighting Middle Class Debt Relief*](/chuck-edwards/ppp-loans-student-debt) Edwards’ McDonald’s company received and had forgiven a seven-figure PPP loan even as he backed efforts to block student-loan relief and criticized it as an “unfair” giveaway.
- [:rotating_light: *Was Officially Sanctioned For Misusing Taxpayer-Funded Communications*](/chuck-edwards/misuse-of-official-resources) A bipartisan House commission found he violated rules by using official mass emails for partisan attacks and ordered a formal sanction and mandatory training.
- [:briefcase: *Blurred The Line Between Public Office And Private Business Interests*](/chuck-edwards/conflicts-of-interest) He steered official spending to a donor’s brand-new LLC and co-sponsored legislation benefiting franchise businesses like his McDonald’s outlets, raising conflict-of-interest concerns.
- [:file_folder: *Cast A Deciding Vote Blocking An Epstein-Files Release Amendment*](/chuck-edwards/epstein-files-vote) Edwards voted “Yea” on a 211–210 procedural motion that kept a closed rule in place and prevented the House from considering Ro Khanna’s amendment to require DOJ to collect and publicly release all Epstein-related records.
