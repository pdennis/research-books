# How To Win Against Burt Jones

Burt Jones supported federal legislation that stripped health care from hundreds of thousands of Georgians, set up future cuts to Medicare, cut SNAP benefits, and rescinded tax credits meant to support clean energy jobs and projects in Georgia. Jones praised Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” and opposed Medicaid expansion. He also lauded Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” even as its cuts affected thousands of Georgia federal workers and those reliant on Social Security. Jones praised Trump’s tariffs as they crushed Georgia’s economy, which was 7^th^ in the nation for net exports, ignoring the [stock market crashing](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/04/nx-s1-5352362/markets-selloff-dow-trump-tariffs) and increasing food prices. Jones supported Georgia’s 2019 abortion ban and attended events with extreme anti-abortion organizations. As a state senator and lieutenant governor, Jones used his power to attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and to advance legislation that would benefit his family’s business. In addition, Jones used his wealth to enrich his own campaigns.

Jones praised Trump’s [“aggressive approach”](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/burt-jones-politically-georgia-22725/s-DUEX8s8NjKO?si=da931965015e4d86b6f2d04522e5cdce&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) while [two-thirds of Georgians](https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-republicans-industries-brace-for-impact-of-trumps-tariffs/LSOO37N5AJDWLB3CV2T3CYC64A/) believed the tariffs would cause their everyday costs to increase.

### Burt Jones stood by while trump attacked social security and fired hard-working Georgians

-   In 2025, Burt Jones [praised](https://x.com/burtjonesforga/status/1885725137833459722) Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” as DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) [ability](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/) to [deliver services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. More than [2 million Georgians](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/ga.pdf) relied on Social Security benefits.

Trump’s DOGE also threatened the livelihoods of [115,600 federal workers](https://pro.stateaffairs.com/ga/politics/georgia-doge-federal-cuts) in Georgia.

Since the beginning of the Trump administration, [$2.9 billion](https://www.macon.com/news/business/article312967104.html) in clean energy projects that were projected to create 1,100 jobs in Georgia were [canceled](https://www.macon.com/news/business/article312967104.html).

Frontline Policy Action’s mission was to educate others on [“the reality of the unborn and the evil of abortion.”](https://www.facebook.com/FrontlinePolicy/posts/pfbid0TDzt4TDHspRT1EN1Tgq1UMUctVJw4wbAELaQcqFJUzJNJV9bjKY99yKgkXKMGsGml?__cft__%5b0%5d=AZavaiNASpA_zrl3cDehTyCYxucPy0VMH8syRT_y223RFtyM8dsZe_TpL5yznffCcJW0RBIUIdUdEuYNo0N6Hoxt8N7rcX8JL2QLKztLeOnqpO2gmJ1P-zGUk2_Mp_fIejN1r70-YKCYe2TsB6jU8TK5Lg3AP6fLuQYbaiWjQlp_PwPWh1iGVneBM_vm873PV6w&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R) The organization also [opposed increasing access to birth control](https://www.facebook.com/FrontlinePolicy/posts/pfbid02cFYukpWh3rBQmuTqtqte74bVZaQL5JypUaGeNeMX2dUGbdKamkMt6sLWGLWzzkznl?__cft__%5b0%5d=AZbcaRu8hNq6ctuCxrC7_xDnz2ownMlYZC7LEgtlb05uMq8yrv6Upc4d_3qgVq05ropZyeJI4Ub6mHfqBh8tE_C9CuyQSu7wUpJjEu3uYzeIjTM8nYFmKLh7U2IT54J-DTzEmPHwfPXKaBO2f2HRm8NCEiWRhokxt7N_Do16UQuGVkvlZ9WZTLUcjyZ9i5Aze6A&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R), saying it would cause “uninhibited sexual self-expression,” and claiming the birth control pill had “lifelong effects on fertility.”

**Message:** Burt Jones threatened the reproductive freedoms of Georgians.

### Burt Jones Used His Power And Wealth To Benefit Himself And His Family

-   Burt Jones had a record of ethics controversies, including using his wealth to bolsterhis own campaign, and using his power as lieutenant governor to financially benefit his family’s business. 
-   In 2023 and 2024, as Georgia lieutenant governor, Jones was [“one of the most powerful supporters”](https://www.ajc.com/business/2025/10/10b-hospital-project-backed-by-burt-jones-includes-sea-of-data-centers/) of legislation that would have benefited his father’s $10 billion project. Jones’ father, the [president of Interstate Health Systems](https://www.ajc.com/politics/burt-jones-family-could-benefit-from-new-hospital-overhaul/V6FQ67MLBNAHJNL7YPDOZ6SEBQ/), had purchased 250 acres of land and planned to build a 450,000-square-foot hospital as part of the project. Jones supported legislation twice that [rolled back restrictions on new hospital construction](https://www.ajc.com/politics/burt-jones-family-could-benefit-from-new-hospital-overhaul/V6FQ67MLBNAHJNL7YPDOZ6SEBQ/), which would have allowed his father’s project to move forward more quickly. 
-   During his 2022 lieutenant governor campaign, Jones [failed to disclose](https://www.ajc.com/politics/lg-candidate-jones-didnt-report-private-campaign-flights-in-disclosures/WRXXGMJZHNCTDG2ZLHXBKYJGIE/) his use of his family’s private jet for at least eight one-way flights that corresponded with campaign events he attended. Also during this campaign, Jones [misused funds](https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-georgia-campaigns-government-and-politics-campaign-contributions-5bab8a2810c1ba96fbb9b31cd2040def) from his state senate campaign and was required to pay a $1,000 fine and reimburse his senate campaign $8,000.
-   In his 2025 gubernatorial campaign, Jones [loaned himself $10 million](https://apnews.com/article/burt-jones-republican-georgia-lieutenant-governor-2026-62ac32083e0792cd55a5014e4a5e8bc8) to his campaign committee. One of his primary opponents, Chris Carr, [filed a complaint](https://apnews.com/article/georgia-governor-2026-carr-burt-jones-lawsuit-19086a4662858f519b1ed3b0af963a71) calling for an investigation into the source of those funds, as [Jones’ 2022 financial disclosure](https://georgiarecorder.com/2025/12/04/carrs-challenge-to-jones-10m-campaign-loan-dismissed-by-ethics-panel/) showed he had only $700,000 in cash and securities. Carr’s complaint was ultimately dismissed after it was determined that Jones’ loan did not qualify as [“an illegal or excessive contribution.”](https://georgiarecorder.com/2025/12/04/carrs-challenge-to-jones-10m-campaign-loan-dismissed-by-ethics-panel/)

**Message:** Burt Jones had a record of ethics controversies, including using his wealth to enrich his own campaign, and using his power as Georgia lieutenant governor to increase his family’s wealth. 

### Burt Jones Propagated The Big Lie And Served As A Fake Elector

-   In 2025, Trump issued Burt Jones a [preemptive pardon](https://georgiarecorder.com/2025/11/10/trump-pardon-of-2020-election-allies-does-not-erase-fulton-county-election-interference-charges/) for his role as an alternate elector attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Jones wrote a [petition](https://www.ajc.com/politics/in-georgia-concerted-gop-pushback-blocks-trump-attempts-to-overturn-election/WCRIAROVEZADVLEL5Q6QHY6UFU/) calling for the Georgia legislature to appoint alternate electors, and he was one of 16 [fake electors](https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/08/23/case-against-georgias-lieutenant-governor-for-alleged-2020-fake-elector-scheme-awaits-prosecutor/) who signed a false certification that Trump won the state of Georgia. He also [intended to deliver](https://web.archive.org/web/20251202153816/https:/www.ajc.com/politics/election/georgia-2020-election-what-happened/) a letter to Pence urging him to delay the tally of electoral votes, before [deciding against it at last minute.](https://web.archive.org/web/20251202153816/https:/www.ajc.com/politics/election/georgia-2020-election-what-happened/) 
-   Due to his role in attempting to overturn the 2020 election, Jones [lost his position](https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-election-deniers-in-state-senate-stripped-of-chairmanships/KAWCPO4DDBAKLHIMQS3PJ2JKXM/) as Chair of the Insurance and Labor Committee, and was [warned](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/us/georgia-investigation-trump.html) that he could be prosecuted. In 2024, a special prosecutor ultimately [decided against](https://apnews.com/article/georgia-election-investigation-trump-burt-jones-49c8639a11b930066d50f7dc0c6564e0) indicting Jones. 

**Message:** Burt Jones attempted to use his position as a state senator to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia, and was rewarded with a preemptive pardon from Trump.
