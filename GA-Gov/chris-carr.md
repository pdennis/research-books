# How To Win Against Chris Carr

Chris Carr supported federal legislation that stripped health care from thousands of Georgians, set up future cuts to Medicare, cut SNAP benefits, and rescinded tax credits meant to support clean energy jobs and projects in Georgia. Carr praised Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” and opposed the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion. He also lauded Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” even as its cuts affected thousands of Georgia federal workers and those reliant on Social Security. Carr remained silent on Trump’s tariffs even as they crushed Georgia’s economy, which was 7^th^ in the nation for net exports, ignoring the [stock market crashing](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/04/nx-s1-5352362/markets-selloff-dow-trump-tariffs) and increasing food prices. Carr supported Georgia’s extreme abortion ban and dismissed claims it would endanger pregnant women. Carr defended Trump as he overstepped his authority and deployed the National Guard against American cities. Carr also overstepped his authority when he used his power as Georgia attorney general to file RICO charges against Atlanta protesters without following protocol. 

### Carr Supported Devastating Health Care Cuts

-   In 2025, Carr [supported](https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/07/georgia-republicans-back-trump-tax-bill-despite-deep-cuts-to-programs/) Trump’s [“One Big Beautiful Bill,”](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) which is estimated to kick [17 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including [nearly 12 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) who rely on Medicaid. More than [624,000 Georgians](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) could lose their health insurance as a result of the bill.
-   Carr called the Affordable Care Act [“unconstitutional”](https://www.wabe.org/aca-lawsuit-has-georgia-advocates-worried/) and [joined efforts](https://georgiarecorder.com/briefs/supreme-court-could-end-obamacare-georgias-new-medicaid-plan/) to have it struck down. More than [1.5 million Georgians](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/marketplace-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=0&selectedRows=%7B%22states%22:%7B%22georgia%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) were enrolled in Affordable Care Act Marketplace health insurance plans. Carr called Medicaid expansion [“the largest tax increase in state history.”](https://www.ajc.com/politics/why-chris-carr-thinks-his-head-start-in-georgias-2026-governors-race-will-pay-off/5P5ZZQ7DOFDVVA5ZRDKQZWGPEU/) By 2034, more than [93,000 Medicaid recipients](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) in Georgia were expected to lose coverage due to Trump’s tax bill.

**Message:** Carr supported ripping away health care from hundreds of thousands of Georgians to fund tax cuts for the wealthy. 

### Carr Supported Massive Cuts To Medicare

-   In 2025, Carr [supported](https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/07/georgia-republicans-back-trump-tax-bill-despite-deep-cuts-to-programs/) the [Republicans’ reconciliation bill](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would trigger [$500 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare.

**Message:** Carr supported making massive cuts to health care services seniors rely on. 

### Carr Was Silent On Trump’s Devastating Tariffs 

-   In 2025, Carr [remained silent](https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-republicans-industries-brace-for-impact-of-trumps-tariffs/LSOO37N5AJDWLB3CV2T3CYC64A/) on Trump’s tariffs, dooming Georgia’s ranking as [7^th^ in the nation](https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/trumps-tariff-plan-sparks-economic-uncertainty-georgia) for net exports and harming the state’s key industries of agriculture, automotive manufacturing, construction, and port logistics. Rather than speaking out against the devastating tariffs, Carr merely pledged to [“work with the administration”](https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-republicans-industries-brace-for-impact-of-trumps-tariffs/LSOO37N5AJDWLB3CV2T3CYC64A/) to treat domestic businesses [“fairly,”](https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-republicans-industries-brace-for-impact-of-trumps-tariffs/LSOO37N5AJDWLB3CV2T3CYC64A/) even while [two-thirds of Georgians](https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-republicans-industries-brace-for-impact-of-trumps-tariffs/LSOO37N5AJDWLB3CV2T3CYC64A/) believed the tariffs would cause their everyday costs to increase.

**Message:** Carr was unwilling to stand up for Georgia families and small businesses as Trump’s tariffs crushed key Georgia industries.

### Carr Supported Stripping SNAP Benefits From Georgia Families 

-   In 2025, Carr [supported](https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/07/georgia-republicans-back-trump-tax-bill-despite-deep-cuts-to-programs/) Trump’s [“One Big Beautiful Bill,”](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) which made the [largest cut to SNAP in history](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-senate-republican-leaderships-reconciliation-bill-takes). Carr also [claimed](https://youtu.be/52sPJgvhPPw) it was not the state’s responsibility to supplement SNAP while federal funds were paused during the government shutdown, even while nearly [514,000 households in Georgia](https://www.fns.usda.gov/data-research/data-visualization/snap-community-characteristics-congressional-district-dashboard) relied on SNAP to afford groceries.

**Message:** Carr supported making food more expensive for Georgians.

### Carr stood by while trump attacked social security and fired hard-working Georgians

-   In 2025, Carr [praised](https://youtu.be/zMnApzgUUfQ) Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” as DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) [ability](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/) to [deliver services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. More than [2 million Georgians](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/ga.pdf) relied on Social Security benefits.
-   Carr [promoted](https://youtu.be/GIxfDYP9Q_g) DOGE even though it resulted in [$815 million](https://pro.stateaffairs.com/ga/politics/georgia-doge-federal-cuts) in federal funding cuts to Georgia nonprofits, universities, and organizations and threatened the livelihoods of [115,600 federal workers](https://pro.stateaffairs.com/ga/politics/georgia-doge-federal-cuts) in Georgia.

**Message:** While Social Security lines grew and Georgia workers were laid off, Carr did nothing to help them.

### Carr Supported Legislation That Threatened Clean Energy Jobs In Georgia 

-   In 2025, Carr [supported](https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/07/georgia-republicans-back-trump-tax-bill-despite-deep-cuts-to-programs/) Trump’s [“One Big Beautiful Bill,”](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) which [repealed](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-passes-senate-megabill-trump-ira-tax-credit/752276/) clean energy tax credits and made them harder to access, threatening clean energy jobs in Georgia. Since the beginning of the Trump administration, [$2.9 billion](https://www.macon.com/news/business/article312967104.html) in clean energy projects that were projected to create 1,100 jobs in Georgia were [cancelled](https://www.macon.com/news/business/article312967104.html).
-   Carr also opposed other environmentally friendly policies, including [regulating fossil fuel emissions](https://thecurrentga.org/2024/09/03/the-people-who-control-georgias-climate-and-energy-plans/) and [allowing state pensions to use ESG investment criteria](https://georgiarecorder.com/2022/09/19/gop-leaders-target-woke-investments-through-state-pension-funds/).

**Message:** Carr supported killing job opportunities for one of Georgia’s fastest growing industries to give tax cuts to billionaires. 

### Carr Was An Anti-Abortion Extremist

-   Carr was an out-of-touch anti-abortion extremist who claimed [“life begins at conception.”](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/chris-carr-word-on-the-street-72122/s-FYJ3n5qdmke?si=d5f0f1b0e14f4cbda7acf1caac02cad1&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)
-   As attorney general, Carr defended Georgia’s extreme six-week abortion ban despite concerns it could be harmful to Georgia women. Carr said it was [“preposterous”](https://youtu.be/p8txk3ANDxs)  to suggest women who miscarried could be prosecuted under the [“personhood provision”](https://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/jen-jordan-and-chris-carr-clash-over-abortion-law-during-georgia-attorney-general-debate/) in Georgia’s extreme abortion ban. When a brain dead pregnant woman was kept on life support against her family’s wishes, Carr [claimed the abortion ban was not responsible](https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/ag-heartbeat-law-misapplied-case-pregnant-georgia-mom-kept-alive/85-0eabfb9f-24cd-4222-8c50-2f6806aa4822) for the circumstance. Carr even asked for Georgia’s extreme abortion ban to be enforced while it was under appeal because [“unborn children are at risk every day”](https://georgiarecorder.com/briefs/georgia-ag-appeals-ruling-overturning-states-six-week-abortion-ban/) without it.

**Message:** Carr supported Georgia’s extreme abortion ban while Georgia women were at risk of prosecution and medical malpractice.

### Carr Would Not Protect Georgians From Trump Deploying The National Guard To Georgia’s Cities

-   Carr [defended Trump](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2025/06/11/georgias-chris-carr-25-attorneys-general-supporting-presidents-national-guard-deployment/) against accusations of overstepping his authority as Trump deployed the National Guard in American cities and ordered attacks on suspected “narco-terrorists” in the Caribbean.
-   Carr [praised](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2025/06/11/georgias-chris-carr-25-attorneys-general-supporting-presidents-national-guard-deployment/) Trump’s decision to deploy the National Guard against protesters in California, and criticized other state’s governors that resisted Trump’s [“crack down on crime.”](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/chris-carr-the-austin-rhodes-show-10825/s-3cqLU4BeaIV?si=c0fdf1400df243379a71aac81c3251f3&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) Carr even [argued](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/chris-carr-the-morning-xtra-61225/s-LGx30fGDfct?si=bb1b33c78b654781baa8f0d1b114d4a6&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) that Trump had the legal authority to do so under the Militia Act of 1908 and the Insurrection Act.
-   Carr also [defended](https://youtu.be/_p-YKtXMo-8) Trump’s authority to attack suspected “drug boats” without cause, but argued that, if Trump did not already have the legal authority, Congress should just give it to him.

**Message:** Carr would not protect Georgians as Trump continues to test how far he can exceed his authority.

### Carr Filed Rico Charges Against 61 Protesters Without Having The Authority To Do So Under Georgia’s Rico Law

-   In 2023, Carr filed [the largest Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) case “against protesters in U.S. history”](https://apnews.com/article/atlanta-cop-city-rico-charges-61-9d0928ca44c5ddc931cd640a8805664a) after activists protested the construction of a police training facility on Atlanta public forest land.
-   Carr filed the charges against 61 protesters who were concerned about the ecological impacts of the deforestation required to build one of [“the largest police-training centers in the country,”](https://dissentmagazine.org/article/the-criminalization-of-solidarity-the-stop-cop-city-prosecutions/) which earned it the nickname “Cop City.” Carr claimed the protesters were members of an [“anarchist, anti-police, and anti-business extremist organization.”](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/06/us/cop-city-protesters-indicted-rico)
-   In 2025, a Georgia judge [tossed the racketeering charges](https://apnews.com/article/atlanta-cop-city-rico-charges-61-9d0928ca44c5ddc931cd640a8805664a) after determining Carr lacked the authority to secure the indictments under Georgia’s RICO law [without the governor’s permission.](https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/jude-says-he-will-toss-stop-cop-city-rico-charges)

**Message:** Carr has a record of denying Georgians’ right to protest while lacking the authority to do so.
