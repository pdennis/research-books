<h2>Raffensperger Praised DOGE And The Trump Administration Despite The Harm It Was Causing To The Social Security Administration</h2>
<h3>Raffensperger Praised DOGE For “Rightsizing” The Government And Making Cuts To “Get The Best Value For Our Taxpayers”</h3>
<p><strong>2025: Raffensperger Believed That “Government Should Operate The Same Way” As A Business, “Trying To Get The Best Value For Our Taxpayers,” And Lauded GOP Lawmakers Who “Got The Message: How Do We Size Government To Get The Job Done With The Right Number Of People?”</strong> According to Raffensperger at the Networking at Lunch Chamber Luncheon, “I'm good with pencil sharpening because I’m using numbers also come out of the construction business. And one thing I know is in contracts, general contractors never pay a nickel more than they need to pay because the developers never pay a nickel more and so on it rolls down the hill. So, you really have sharp pencils. And I believe government should operate the same way, trying to get the best value for our taxpayers. Because everyone in this room is a taxpayer. [...] How do we deliver value every day for taxpayers? That's what drives me every day when I work in this office as secretary of state and any office I ever will hold and any office that I've held in the past, that I think that needs to be paramount. And I'm so grateful that finally in Washington, D.C., they got the message: How do we size government to get the job done with the right number of people?” [Raffensperger Networking At Lunch Chamber Luncheon,&nbsp;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/0bdaaee7-cf84-462f-86df-5be15ac57cbb/s-XeSfV3gbzVp?si=d7d2930b6ca3413e84a8eb36c0613708&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">5/1/25</a>] (AUDIO)</p>
<p><strong>2025: Raffensperger Praised DOGE And Elon Musk’s Effort To “Rightsize” Government And Ensure It’s “Effective.”</strong> According to Raffensperger on the Brian Kilmeade Show, “Look at how all the out-of-control spending. And meanwhile, hardworking Georgians, hardworking Americans, were getting hit every day. They were struggling, trying to keep up with Biden inflation. And so, all those things came together. People know they need to make a change and they made a change and they're doing in a big way. What Elon Musk is trying to do with DOGE is rightsize government. We want to make sure that government is the right size and it's effective. We have shown that you can have fast elections. You can get the results quickly. Why can't we do that in all government agencies.” [Brad Raffensperger Interview - Brian Kilmeade Show,&nbsp;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/brad-raffensperger-brian-kilmeade-show-33125/s-WSPYlxxa4i6?si=d3f835d74f2349e49cc7408b78bc5950&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">3/31/25</a>] (AUDIO)</p>

This is the largest staffing cut in SSA’s history.[2] (See Figure 1.)"
