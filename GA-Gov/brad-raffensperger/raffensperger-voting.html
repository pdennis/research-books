<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In 2025, Raffensperger purged <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/georgia-finalizes-cancelation-voter-purge-registrations">nearly 471,000 names</a> from Georgia’s voter rolls, drawing criticism that the purges were racially biased. In Raffensperger’s 2025 voter purge, Fair Fight found that <a href="https://atlanta.capitalbnews.org/black-voter-cancellation-georgia-2025/">44 percent</a> of voters on the cancellation list were non-Hispanic Black people despite only making up 31 percent of Georgia’s registered voters. Raffensperger claimed the demographic data was being <a href="https://atlanta.capitalbnews.org/black-voter-cancellation-georgia-2025/">“incorrectly”</a> interpreted, and argued that voters on the cancellation list had multiple options to remain active voters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2020, Raffensperger <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/judge-dismisses-request-for-more-spanish-ballot-access-in-georgia/NZCLPDCS4ZESJMNA7OF7RFK77I/">was sued</a> for violating the Voting Rights Act for not fulfilling requirements to send election materials in both English and Spanish to areas with large Latino populations. That suit was <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/judge-dismisses-request-for-more-spanish-ballot-access-in-georgia/NZCLPDCS4ZESJMNA7OF7RFK77I/">ultimately dismissed</a>, but Raffensperger faced Voting Rights Act violation allegations again in 2021. The <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/feds-sue-georgia-over-new-voting-law/BWMKLI2XJNHIVPCUKJ2HXCDEFY/">Biden administration sued</a> to strike down Georgia’s election law, alleging it disproportionately affected Black voters. Raffensperger argued the law was meant to <a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a40376592/brad-raffensperger-voter-suppression-rusty-bowers/">“expand access,”</a> and in 2025, asked the Trump Justice Department to drop the suit, alleging the Biden administration had tried to paint Georgia as <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/raffensperger-asks-trumps-doj-to-drop-lawsuit-over-georgia-voting-law/PPAD6T4OLJFBPF6EAUI775DHCI/">“Jim Crow 2.0.”</a></p>

<h3>Raffensperger Conducted Massive Voter Roll Purges That Opponents Alleged Were Racially Biased</h3>
<h4>2025: Raffensperger Sent Cancellation Mailers To Nearly 478,000 Georgia Voters And Finalized The Cancellation Of Nearly 471,000 Voter Registrations</h4>
<p><strong>July 2025: Raffensperger Sent Cancellation Mailers To Nearly 478,000 Georgia Voters As Part Of “Voter List Maintenance.”&nbsp;</strong>According to Capital B Atlanta, “On July 10, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office sent cancellation mailers to nearly 478,000 registered voters following a related announcement earlier this year. State election officials say they conduct ‘voter list maintenance’ during off-year election seasons to ensure accurate and up-to-date voter rolls, improve election day efficiency, and prevent potential voter fraud.” [Capital B Atlanta,&nbsp;<a href="https://atlanta.capitalbnews.org/black-voter-cancellation-georgia-2025/">7/28/25</a>]</p>

<h4>Fair Fight Alleged That Raffensperger’s Voter Registration Purges Were Racially Biased</h4>
<p><strong>HEADLINE: “Black Georgians Overrepresented In Mass Voter Registration Purge, Fair Fight Says”</strong> [Capital B Atlanta,&nbsp;<a href="https://atlanta.capitalbnews.org/black-voter-cancellation-georgia-2025/">7/28/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>Fair Fight Found That Raffensperger’s “Voter List Maintenance” Targeted Non-Hispanic Black Voters; Non-Hispanic Black People Made Up About 31% Of Registered Voters In Georgia And Were Overrepresented On The Cancellation List Up To 44%.</strong> According to Capital B Atlanta, “On July 10, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office sent cancellation mailers to nearly 478,000 registered voters following a related announcement earlier this year. State election officials say they conduct ‘voter list maintenance’ during off-year election seasons to ensure accurate and up-to-date voter rolls, improve election day efficiency, and prevent potential voter fraud. Non-Hispanic Black people make up about 31% of registered voters in Georgia. According to Fair Fight’s analysis, they made up 32% of individuals on the cancellation list, but that number maxed out at more than 44% when people most likely to have moved out of Georgia — those who voted in other states in 2022 and 2024 — were removed from the overall count.” [Capital B Atlanta,&nbsp;<a href="https://atlanta.capitalbnews.org/black-voter-cancellation-georgia-2025/">7/28/25</a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fair Right: Only About 35% Of People On The Cancellation List Were White, Despite White Voters Comprising Roughly 50% Of The State’s Registered Voters.&nbsp;</strong>According to Capital B Atlanta, “Fair Fight’s researchers determined only about 35% of people on the cancellation list were white when the same factors were considered, despite white voters comprising roughly 50% of the state’s registered voters.” [Capital B Atlanta,&nbsp;<a href="https://atlanta.capitalbnews.org/black-voter-cancellation-georgia-2025/">7/28/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Fair Fight Found That The Cancellations Specifically Targeted Black Democrats, With Nearly 51% Of Those On The Cancellation List “Likely To Vote Democrat” Compared To Just Under 30% Who Were “Likely Republican Voters.”</strong> According to Capital B Atlanta, “Fair Fight’s research also examined demographic data to determine which political party people on the cancellation list are most likely to support. President Donald Trump has helped the Republican Party make gains with Black voters since 2016, but African Americans still overwhelmingly back Democrats over GOP candidates in most elections. Fair Fight determined just over half of those on Georgia’s latest voter registration cancellation list (50.64%) were likely to vote Democrat, while likely Republican voters made up just under 30%. Projected independent voters were nearly 20% of people on the list.” [Capital B Atlanta,&nbsp;<a href="https://atlanta.capitalbnews.org/black-voter-cancellation-georgia-2025/">7/28/25</a>]</li>
  <li><strong>Fair Fight CEO Lauren Groh-Wargo Claimed Georgia’s Voter Registration Cancellation List “Disproportionately Targets Black Georgians Who Likely Still Live Here.”</strong> According to Capital B Atlanta, “Fair Fight CEO Lauren Groh-Wargo told Capital B Atlanta that the nonprofit’s research shows Georgia’s voter registration cancellation list ‘disproportionately targets Black Georgians who likely still live here.’ She noted that young voters, ages 18-34, were the largest age group on the cancellation list (31%). Voters ages 34-44 came in second at nearly 26%. ‘Once again, politicians are rushing to remove voters based on unreliable data — and young Black voters are bearing the brunt,’ Groh-Wargo told Capital B Atlanta via email on Friday.” [Capital B Atlanta,&nbsp;<a href="https://atlanta.capitalbnews.org/black-voter-cancellation-georgia-2025/">7/28/25</a>]</li>

<h4>Raffensperger Denied Claims That The Voter Roll Purge Was Racially Biased</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Raffensperger’s Office Accused Fair Fight Of “Incorrectly” Interpreting Demographic Data Of Those On The Cancellation List “In An Attempt To Portray Routine List Maintenance As A Nefarious Partisan Or Racial Exercise.”</strong> According to Capital B Atlanta, “When reached for comment, a representative from Raffensperger’s office accused Fair Fight of ‘incorrectly’ interpreting demographic data of those on the cancellation list ‘in an attempt to portray routine list maintenance as a nefarious partisan or racial exercise.’ ‘No voter in Georgia is ever registered by party, which makes any attempt to target expired voter registration records by partisan affiliation impossible and the subsequent conclusions and allegations by Fair Fight deceptive,’ a department spokesman told Capital B Atlanta via email on Friday.” [Capital B Atlanta,&nbsp;<a href="https://atlanta.capitalbnews.org/black-voter-cancellation-georgia-2025/">7/28/25</a>]</p>
<p><strong>2025: Raffensperger: “No Active Voters Are Being Hindered In Any Way By This [Cancellation] Mailing, And Any Voter That Is Impacted Has Multiple Options To Make Sure They Can Remain In Active Status.”</strong> According to Capital B Atlanta, “State election officials say current and former Georgia voters who haven’t had contact with their local elections office in the state for five or more years are considered to be in ‘inactive status,’ making them eligible to have their voter registration canceled. Dying, moving away, committing a felony, or simply choosing not to vote for more than five years and two general election cycles are reasons people’s voter registration can be classified as inactive and eventually canceled. ‘No active voters are being hindered in any way by this [cancellation] mailing, and any voter that is impacted has multiple options to make sure they can remain in active status,’ the secretary of state spokesperson added.” [Capital B Atlanta,&nbsp;<a href="https://atlanta.capitalbnews.org/black-voter-cancellation-georgia-2025/">7/28/25</a>]</p>

<h3>Raffensperger Wanted To Require Photo ID To Vote, Ban “Ballot Harvesting,” And Mandate Audits</h3>
<p><strong>2025: Raffensperger Called For A Federal Photo ID Requirement For All Forms Of Voting, A Ban On “Ballot Harvesting” In Federal Elections, “Mandated Risk-Limiting Audits After Votes,” And A Federal Law Barring Non-Citizens From Voting.</strong> According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “In the letter, Raffensperger said Georgia has issued more than 4 million “mass list maintenance notices” during his tenure. But he also pushed for a series of changes to federal voting rules, including relaxing the 90-day blackout period before federal elections. He also called for a federal photo ID requirement for all forms of voting, a ban on ballot harvesting in federal elections, mandated risk-limiting audits after votes and a federal law barring non-citizens from voting..” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/07/rich-mccormick-rules-out-us-senate-run-in-georgia-as-gop-field-takes-shape/">7/22/25</a>]</p>
