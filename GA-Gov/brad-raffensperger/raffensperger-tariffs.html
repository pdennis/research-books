<p><strong>2025: Raffensperger Pointed To Steel Importers Who Wondered, “What Do These Tariffs Do” To My Business, And Claimed That They Would “Figure It Out And Somehow Make It Work Through This Situation.”</strong> According to Raffensperger at the Networking at Lunch Chamber Luncheon, “Particularly, I talked to some folks back there are importing steel right now, I think they get 15% foreign steel, 85% of American steel. And that's just because the American mills have never produced enough. That may change. But right now, they're thinking, what do these tariffs do to them? They'll figure it out and somehow make it work through this situation.” [Raffensperger Networking at Lunch Chamber Luncheon,&nbsp;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/brad-raffensperger-networking-at-lunch-chamber-luncheon-5125/s-mUh7VRtpUmb?si=0efda58bb7144968806249bd8c71a775&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">5/1/25</a>] (AUDIO)</p>

<h4>Raffensperger Praised Trump’s Tariffs For Accelerating The “Reindustrialization Of America”</h4>
<p><strong>2025: Raffensperger Claimed To Sympathize With Business Owners Struggling Under Tariffs, Offering Them “A Big Shoulder To Cry On,” But Then Declared That Tariffs Were Working And Had “Accelerated” The “Reindustrialization Of America.”</strong> According to Raffensperger at the Hoschton Business Meeting, “We are borrowing out of our line of credit what was I supposed to do. I couldn't put product on the job site. We were upside down before you know it. Talk ugly it wasn’t fun. And if any of you are facing the tariff situation. I really can't help you, but I have a big shoulder that you can come cry on it. I've been there before, and you just kind of got to you’ve got to switch down and somehow you work through it. [...] She was willing to actually go get a second job, because that's what it took to put more food on the table for a family or to provide for herself. One good paying job can cure all that. And so, here's some breaking news. Just kind of look at what Washington’s having right now. I want to let you know that we're going to have something that really should excite, all of you. People are calling it the reindustrialization of America and started, and it was going to start anyway. But it's gotten accelerated by President Trump because this whole tariff situation already, which you’ve seen.” [Raffensperger Hoschton Business Meeting,&nbsp;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/brad-raffensperger-hoschton-business-meeting-72325/s-xmgDUFWOPEc?si=cb0d2da367ec44cda7b07df30eac79af&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">7/23/25</a>] (AUDIO)</p>

<p><strong>Trump’s Tariffs Threatened Georgia’s Agricultural Industry, Which Produced “Far More Than The Local Market Demands,” And Relied On Exports To Other Countries, With A “Significant Share” Going To China.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “And Savannah’s booming ports are&nbsp;bracing for a slowdown&nbsp;as tariff threats and other business headwinds exact a toll on global shipping. Georgia imports more from China than from any other country, although the share of Chinese goods coming through the Savannah port is shrinking.&nbsp;Few sectors are more vulnerable than agriculture, Georgia’s largest industry. State farmers produce far more than the local market demands, and much of that is shipped overseas. A significant share goes to China, the epicenter of the trade battle.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-republicans-industries-brace-for-impact-of-trumps-tariffs/LSOO37N5AJDWLB3CV2T3CYC64A/">4/18/25</a>]</p>
