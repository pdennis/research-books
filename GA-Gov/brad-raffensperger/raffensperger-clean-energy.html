<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In 2025, Raffensperger <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/brad-raffensperger-politically-georgia-92925/s-W7E9yYSHXjz?si=51530ccff47a4f188dec4b4043b06f62&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">supported</a> Trump’s <a href="https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190">“One Big Beautiful Bill,”</a> which <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-passes-senate-megabill-trump-ira-tax-credit/752276/">repealed</a> clean energy tax credits and made them harder to access, threatening clean energy jobs in Georgia. Since the beginning of the Trump administration, <a href="https://www.macon.com/news/business/article312967104.html">$2.9 billion</a> in clean energy projects that were projected to create 1,100 jobs in Georgia were <a href="https://www.macon.com/news/business/article312967104.html">canceled</a>.</p>
<h2>Raffensperger Supported A Bill That Threatened Georgia’s Clean Energy Jobs&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>Raffensperger Supported The Republican Reconciliation Bill Which Cut Clean Energy Tax Credits That Supported Georgia Jobs</h3>
<h4>Raffensperger Supported Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Which Cut Inflation Reduction Act Clean Energy Tax Credits And Made It Harder For Projects To Qualify For Clean Energy Tax Credits</h4>
<p><strong>September 2025: Raffensperger Said Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” Was “Needed” To Extend Middle Class Tax Cuts, And Said The Bill Helped “Every Small Business Owner” And “Every Person That Had Personal Income Tax.”&nbsp;</strong>According to Raffensperger in an interview with Politically Georgia, “HOST: Where do you stand on the big, beautiful bill or whatever the president is calling it these days? Because we're already seeing Democrats running for governor, running for other higher offices campaigning against that, particularly the the Medicaid cuts that they fear are already compounding problems that rural hospitals and not just rural hospitals, just hospitals in general are already facing.&nbsp;RAFFENSPERGER: Well, I think we need to understand that the key part of that bill was extending middle class tax cuts, The middle-class tax cuts were going to expire. And so that needed to extend it out because otherwise it actually was a tax increase. They were rolled back in 2017. This was just a continuation of those tax cuts that I think helps every small business owner because they report their income on their personal taxes. And every person that had personal income tax, that was huge.” [Brad Raffensperger Interview – Politically Georgia, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/brad-raffensperger-politically-georgia-92925/s-W7E9yYSHXjz?si=51530ccff47a4f188dec4b4043b06f62&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">9/29/25</a>] (AUDIO)</p>

  <li><strong>The Republican Reconciliation Bill Restricted The Ability Of Projects To Qualify For Certain Clean Energy Tax Credits And Repealed Electric Vehicle Tax Credits. </strong>According to Utility Dive, "The bill restricts the ability of projects to qualify for the tech-neutral clean electricity 45Y production tax credit and 48E investment tax credit, shortens the timeline for those credits, and ends the 25D residential solar credit after this year. The 25E, 30D, 30C and 45W electric vehicle credits will terminate after Sept. 30. While clean energy advocates and congressional Democrats maintain that the final version of the bill goes too far in slashing IRA credits, some Republicans wanted to see more significant cuts."

  <li><strong>The Final Republican Reconciliation Bill Allowed Projects To Avoid A Requirement That They Be In Service By 2027 To Qualify For Certain Credits If They Began Construction Within A Year Of The Bill Being Signed.&nbsp;</strong>According to Utility Dive, "Before the House Freedom Caucus reached an agreement with House leadership to vote in favor of the bill, the caucus circulated a memo that criticized the Senate’s version of the bill for offering an exemption from the House’s onerous requirement that clean energy projects be placed in service by 2027 to qualify for the 45Y and 48E credits. The Senate version allows projects to avoid this requirement if they begin construction within a year after the bill is signed into law."

<h4>Trump’s Tax Bill Cut Federal Tax Credits For Wind, Solar, Storage, And Other Clean Energy Projects, Which Would Kill Tens Of Thousands Of Jobs</h4>
<p><strong>The House Republican Budget Bill Included Cuts To Federal Tax Credits For Wind, Solar, Storage, And Other Clean Energy Projects.</strong> According to Utility Dive, "House Republicans on Thursday morning narrowly passed a sweeping budget bill that guts federal support for wind, solar, storage and other clean energy industries. The bill terminates most technology-neutral clean energy tax credits for projects placed in service after 2028 and those that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill’s passage. It also tightens restrictions on foreign entities’ involvement in projects, creating a ‘truly untenable’ situation for developers, Jefferies analysts said Thursday. Nuclear projects have more time to qualify for the credit."

<p><strong>One Trade Association CEO Said The Bill Would Weaken Power Systems, Send Shockwaves Through The U.S. Economy, And Kill Tens Of Thousands Of Jobs.</strong> According to Utility Dive, "The House bill ‘abruptly dismantles bipartisan, long-standing tax policy that has catalyzed billions in private investment for affordable, reliable energy while sparking a rebirth of manufacturing across America,’ AEU President and CEO Heather O’Neill said. ‘If enacted as written, this bill will weaken our power system and send shockwaves throughout the U.S. economy by raising electricity prices, killing tens of thousands of jobs and ceding energy dominance to China.’" [Utility Dive,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-gop-budget-worse-than-feared-for-clean-energy-analysts/748862/">5/22/25</a>]</p>
