# How To Win Against Brad Raffensperger

Brad Raffensperger supported federal legislation that stripped health care from hundreds of thousands of Georgians, set up future cuts to Medicare, cut SNAP benefits, and rescinded tax credits meant to support clean energy jobs and projects in Georgia. Raffensperger praised Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” and opposed Medicaid expansion. He also lauded Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” even as its cuts affected thousands of Georgia federal workers and those reliant on Social Security. Raffensperger praised Trump’s tariffs even as they crushed Georgia’s economy, which was 7^th^ in the nation for net exports, ignoring the [stock market crashing](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/04/nx-s1-5352362/markets-selloff-dow-trump-tariffs) and increasing food prices. As a state representative, Raffensperger sponsored a bill proposing a constitutional amendment that would ban abortion from “the moment of fertilization.” As Georgia secretary of state, Raffensperger’s actions threatened Georgia’s election integrity and voters’ private information, and he used his office to disproportionately suppress voters of color. 

### Raffensperger Supported Devastating Health Care Cuts

-   In 2025, Raffensperger [supported](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/brad-raffensperger-politically-georgia-92925/s-W7E9yYSHXjz?si=51530ccff47a4f188dec4b4043b06f62&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) Trump’s [“One Big Beautiful Bill,”](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) which is estimated to kick [17 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) off their health insurance, including [nearly 12 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/01/least-17-million-americans-would-lose-insurance-under-trump-plan/) who rely on Medicaid. More than [624,000 Georgians](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) could lose their health insurance as a result of the bill. More than [1.5 million Georgians](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/state-indicator/marketplace-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=0&selectedRows=%7B%22states%22:%7B%22georgia%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) were enrolled in Affordable Care Act Marketplace health insurance plans.
-   Raffensperger supported Medicaid work requirements, suggesting that Medicaid recipients who did not work did not have [“pride in themselves,”](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/4e685d0a-2295-48b5-8d40-078102b2d9c5/s-UtubrDQ6TNX?si=018e3a9a2b10452dae861f83c5cb557d&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) and presented [“private free market solutions”](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/fa525545-d3eb-4b4d-98c5-bc6c3ea297d9/s-tlzeGsGIepX?si=a436436d744b4612aa0085bc9f1e4409&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) as an alternative to Medicaid expansion. By 2034, more than [93,400 Medicaid recipients](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9cfdee90-dd29-41e8-97da-b5dcdc0317cf/updated-jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) in Georgia were expected to lose coverage due to Trump’s tax bill. 

**Message:** Raffensperger supported ripping away health care from hundreds of thousands of Georgians to fund tax cuts for the wealthy. 

### Raffensperger Supported Massive Cuts To Medicare

-   In 2025, Raffensperger [supported](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/brad-raffensperger-politically-georgia-92925/s-W7E9yYSHXjz?si=51530ccff47a4f188dec4b4043b06f62&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) the [Republicans’ reconciliation bill](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would trigger [$500 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/21/medicare-cuts-big-beautiful-bill-republicans-house/) in cuts to Medicare. 

**Message:** Raffensperger supported making massive cuts to health care services seniors rely on. 

### Raffensperger Praised Trump’s Devastating Tariffs

-   In 2025, Raffensperger praised Trump’s tariffs for accelerating the [“reindustrialization of America,”](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/brad-raffensperger-hoschton-business-meeting-72325/s-xmgDUFWOPEc?si=cb0d2da367ec44cda7b07df30eac79af&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) dooming Georgia’s ranking as [7^th^ in the nation](https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/trumps-tariff-plan-sparks-economic-uncertainty-georgia) for net exports and harming the state’s key industries of agriculture, automotive manufacturing, construction, and port logistics. 
-   Rather than speaking out against the devastating tariffs, Raffensperger asserted that Georgia business owners would [“somehow make it work,”](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/brad-raffensperger-networking-at-lunch-chamber-luncheon-5125/s-mUh7VRtpUmb?si=0efda58bb7144968806249bd8c71a775&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) even while [two-thirds of Georgians](https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-republicans-industries-brace-for-impact-of-trumps-tariffs/LSOO37N5AJDWLB3CV2T3CYC64A/) believed the tariffs would cause their everyday costs to increase.

**Message:** Raffensperger praised Trump’s tariffs as they crushed key Georgia industries.

### Raffensperger Supported Stripping SNAP Benefits From Georgia Families 

-   In 2025, Raffensperger [supported](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/brad-raffensperger-politically-georgia-92925/s-W7E9yYSHXjz?si=51530ccff47a4f188dec4b4043b06f62&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) Trump’s [“One Big Beautiful Bill,”](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) which made the [largest cut to SNAP in history](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-senate-republican-leaderships-reconciliation-bill-takes). Nearly [514,000 households in Georgia](https://www.fns.usda.gov/data-research/data-visualization/snap-community-characteristics-congressional-district-dashboard) relied on SNAP to afford groceries.

**Message:** Raffensperger supported making food more expensive for Georgians.

### Raffensperger stood by while trump attacked social security and fired hard-working Georgians

-   In 2025, Raffensperger [praised](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/0bdaaee7-cf84-462f-86df-5be15ac57cbb/s-XeSfV3gbzVp?si=d7d2930b6ca3413e84a8eb36c0613708&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” for [“rightsizing” the government](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/brad-raffensperger-brian-kilmeade-show-33125/s-WSPYlxxa4i6?si=d3f835d74f2349e49cc7408b78bc5950&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) as DOGE-driven cuts and downsizing were [affecting](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/social-security-seniors-drive) the [federal government’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/20/social-security-wait-times-cuts/) [ability](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/07/social-security-website-crashes-musk-trump/) to [deliver services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/social-security-layoffs-trump-musk/) to seniors. More than [2 million Georgians](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/factsheets/cong_stats/2024/ga.pdf) relied on Social Security benefits. 
-   Raffensperger said the actions of DOGE showed the Trump administration was fulfilling its responsibility to be [“stewards of the tax dollars of hard-working Americans,”](https://www.ajc.com/politics/top-georgia-republicans-cheer-trumps-washington-overhaul/RXQOVWC3JJGLHE6GIRE4G4IZZM/) even though DOGE policies resulted in [$815 million](https://pro.stateaffairs.com/ga/politics/georgia-doge-federal-cuts) in federal funding cuts to Georgia nonprofits, universities, and organizations and threatened the livelihoods of [115,600 federal workers](https://pro.stateaffairs.com/ga/politics/georgia-doge-federal-cuts) in Georgia.

**Message:** While Social Security lines grew and Georgia workers were laid off, Raffensperger did nothing to help them.

### Raffensperger Supported Legislation That Threatened Clean Energy Jobs In Georgia

-   In 2025, Raffensperger [supported](https://soundcloud.com/abpac/brad-raffensperger-politically-georgia-92925/s-W7E9yYSHXjz?si=51530ccff47a4f188dec4b4043b06f62&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) Trump’s [“One Big Beautiful Bill,”](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/119-1/190) which [repealed](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/house-passes-senate-megabill-trump-ira-tax-credit/752276/) clean energy tax credits and made them harder to access, threatening clean energy jobs in Georgia. Since the beginning of the Trump administration, [$2.9 billion](https://www.macon.com/news/business/article312967104.html) in clean energy projects that were projected to create 1,100 jobs in Georgia were [cancelled](https://www.macon.com/news/business/article312967104.html).

**Message:** Raffensperger supported killing job opportunities for one of Georgia’s fastest growing industries to give tax cuts to billionaires. 

### Raffensperger Was An Anti-Abortion Extremist

-   Raffensperger was an anti-abortion extremist who believed that [“life and personhood begins at the moment of fertilization and ends at natural death.”](https://www.facebook.com/GRTLPAC/videos/2120882317927919/?__cft__%5b0%5d=AZVvmsDdGrs5Y-4Ca34TP80uTgpaud3WsJnrqTE9nvFbicpPv9ChW1a6z_Ef6EpthJgWLtXo1UDnvCTZwz8LNwa7TLHN0--57w9FIbhVRVwvnWBML_bX_Kq5VGARCPlxKDnxIcdYEDU9lREbhFr69yyq-3vS4Yx5g05y_B7iqlywOXZqR8_1w2D23zcDx_4UR6Oy38hkIsahnJBkaMXqRUSHxVyn74aq8Uf6eYyPi_bK7g&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R) 
-   In 2016, as a state representative, Raffensperger [sponsored](https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/47527)[“a constitutional amendment to ‘recognize the paramount right to life of all human beings.’”](https://www.gpb.org/news/2022/10/10/secretary-of-state-candidates-clash-over-voting-rights) The bill established [“personhood beginning at the moment of fertilization,”](https://web.archive.org/web/20251217182723/https:/grtl.org/the-personhood-amendment/) which would [directly challenge Roe v. Wade](https://web.archive.org/web/20251217183850/https:/grtlpac.org/personhood-amendment/) and lead to a near-total abortion ban. 
-   The Georgia Right to Life PAC [endorsed](https://www.facebook.com/GRTLPAC/videos/2120882317927919/?__cft__%5b0%5d=AZVvmsDdGrs5Y-4Ca34TP80uTgpaud3WsJnrqTE9nvFbicpPv9ChW1a6z_Ef6EpthJgWLtXo1UDnvCTZwz8LNwa7TLHN0--57w9FIbhVRVwvnWBML_bX_Kq5VGARCPlxKDnxIcdYEDU9lREbhFr69yyq-3vS4Yx5g05y_B7iqlywOXZqR8_1w2D23zcDx_4UR6Oy38hkIsahnJBkaMXqRUSHxVyn74aq8Uf6eYyPi_bK7g&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R) Raffensperger’s 2018 campaign for Secretary of State. Georgia Right to Life was an extreme anti-abortion organization whose [principles included](https://web.archive.org/web/20251216193631/https:/grtlpac.org/position-statements/) opposition to abortion ban exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother, as well as opposition to emergency contraception.

**Message:** Raffensperger sponsored legislation that would lead to a near-total abortion ban and threatened the reproductive freedoms of Georgians.

### Raffensperger Dismissed Concerns About Georgia’s Election Security

-   In 2024, Raffensperger [launched an online portal](https://www.propublica.org/article/cybersecurity-expert-finds-another-flaw-in-georgia-voter-portal) where Georgia voters could submit a request to cancel their voter registration. However, the website had multiple security vulnerabilities due to what experts called [“incredibly sloppy coding,”](https://www.propublica.org/article/cybersecurity-expert-finds-another-flaw-in-georgia-voter-portal) and [exposed personal information](https://apnews.com/article/georgia-cancel-voter-registration-personal-information-5bf7d7d474e0e077c7fd50141ff487e8) of registered voters and allowed users to [submit voter cancellation requests](https://www.propublica.org/article/cybersecurity-expert-finds-another-flaw-in-georgia-voter-portal) for any voter. When asked about these concerns, Raffensperger [refused to provide information](https://www.propublica.org/article/cybersecurity-expert-finds-another-flaw-in-georgia-voter-portal) about his office’s testing and security procedures. 
-   In 2023, Raffensperger [dismissed concerns](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/23/brad-raffensperger-georgia-dominion-voting-00103298) about the security of Georgia’s voting machines after an [audit](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/23/brad-raffensperger-georgia-dominion-voting-00103298) conducted by security experts found nine vulnerabilities in the software. Raffensperger claimed the findings of the audit were [“overblown and no fixes are needed,”](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/23/brad-raffensperger-georgia-dominion-voting-00103298) despite security experts warning that [“even moderately skilled hackers”](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/23/brad-raffensperger-georgia-dominion-voting-00103298) could interfere with Georgia’s elections.

**Message:** As Georgia’s chief elections officer, Raffensperger ignored security concerns and failed to protect Georgia voters.

### Raffensperger Supported Voter Suppression Tactics That Disproportionately Impacted People Of Color

-   In 2025, Raffensperger purged [nearly 471,000 names](https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/georgia-finalizes-cancelation-voter-purge-registrations) from Georgia’s voter rolls, drawing criticism that the purges were racially biased. In Raffensperger’s 2025 voter purge, [44 percent](https://atlanta.capitalbnews.org/black-voter-cancellation-georgia-2025/) of voters on the cancellation list were non-Hispanic Black people despite only making up 31 percent of Georgia’s registered voters. Raffensperger claimed the demographic data was being [“incorrectly”](https://atlanta.capitalbnews.org/black-voter-cancellation-georgia-2025/) interpreted, and argued that voters on the cancellation list had multiple options to remain active voters. 
-   In 2020, Raffensperger [was sued](https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/judge-dismisses-request-for-more-spanish-ballot-access-in-georgia/NZCLPDCS4ZESJMNA7OF7RFK77I/) for violating the Voting Rights Act for not fulfilling requirements to send election materials in both English and Spanish to areas with large Latino populations. That suit was [ultimately dismissed](https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/judge-dismisses-request-for-more-spanish-ballot-access-in-georgia/NZCLPDCS4ZESJMNA7OF7RFK77I/), but Raffensperger faced Voting Rights Act violation allegations again in 2021. The [Biden administration sued](https://www.ajc.com/politics/feds-sue-georgia-over-new-voting-law/BWMKLI2XJNHIVPCUKJ2HXCDEFY/) to strike down Georgia’s election law, alleging it disproportionately affected Black voters. Raffensperger argued the law was meant to [“expand access,”](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a40376592/brad-raffensperger-voter-suppression-rusty-bowers/) and in 2025, asked the Trump Justice Department to drop the suit, alleging the Biden administration had tried to paint Georgia as [“Jim Crow 2.0.”](https://www.ajc.com/politics/raffensperger-asks-trumps-doj-to-drop-lawsuit-over-georgia-voting-law/PPAD6T4OLJFBPF6EAUI775DHCI/)

**Message:** Raffensperger used his power as secretary of state to disproportionately suppress voters of color in Georgia.
