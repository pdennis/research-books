They issue executive orders and regulations that are supposed to fall within those laws. But it typically doesn't because it's political people that are pushing this. I was a big fan of DOGE, but the way to do that is through Congress, not through the executive branch, because there's only so much that they can do. I wish they'd go back to work.” \[Chris Carr – The Ben Burnett Show, [11/3/25](https://youtu.be/zMnApzgUUfQ)\] (VIDEO)
