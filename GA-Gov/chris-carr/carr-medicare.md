**July 2025: Carr Praised Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Calling It A “Common Sense” Policy That Delivered “Real Results For The People Of Georgia.”** According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “Here are comments from other prominent Republicans about the Senate-passed measure: Attorney General Chris Carr, a candidate for governor ‘This bill strengthens our border security, gives law enforcement the tools they need, and delivers meaningful tax relief to hardworking families. We need more common sense policies that deliver real results for the people of Georgia.’” \[Atlanta Journal-Constitution, [7/2/25](https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/07/georgia-republicans-back-trump-tax-bill-despite-deep-cuts-to-programs/)\]

-   **The “One Big Beautiful Bill” Sped Up The Timeline For When The Medicare Trust Fund Will Become Insolvent, And Without Additional Action, The Bill Would Trigger A $500 Billion Cut In Medicare Funding Between 2026 And 2034.** According to Medicare Advocacy, “On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1 – the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). This sweeping legislation narrowly passed Congress through a special budget process (‘reconciliation’), which allowed it to pass the Senate with a simple majority vote rather than the usual 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. The law extends tax cuts that were first enacted in 2017 and funds other administration priorities. To help pay for these policies, it makes unprecedented cuts to critical safety-net programs that provide health care and other assistance. \[…\] Even with these significant cuts, the Act is still projected to add at least $3.4 trillion to the national debt.\[2\] It also speeds up the timeline for when Medicare’s trust fund (which pays for hospital care) will become insolvent. If Congress takes no additional action, automatic spending cuts will be triggered, reducing Medicare funding by approximately $500 billion between 2026 and 2034.” \[Medicare Advocacy, [7/24/25](https://medicareadvocacy.org/impact-of-the-big-bill-on-medicare/#:~:text=The%20law%20imposes%20a%20nine,to%20make%20Medicare%20more%20affordable.)\]

-   **Congressional Budget Office Estimated That The House Republican Reconciliation Bill Would Trigger Nearly $500 Billion In Cuts To Medicare.** According to a letter the Congressional Budget Office sent to Rep. Brendan Boyle, "Today the Congressional Budget Office transmitted an estimate of the budgetary effects of the 2025 reconciliation bill, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Budget on May 18, 2025. 1 CBO has not yet completed estimates of the effects of interactions among the titles of the legislation. This letter responds to your questions concerning the sequestration (the cancellation of budgetary resources) in accordance with the Statutory Pay‑As‑You‑Go Act of 2010 (S-PAYGO) that would occur if an enacted bill raised deficits by $2.3 trillion over 10 years. Under S-PAYGO, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is required to maintain 5- and 10-year scorecards that it updates with the estimated cumulative changes in revenues and outlays generated by newly enacted legislation. \[…\] The 4 percent maximum reduction in Medicare spending would apply to sequestration orders for years after 2026. If OMB ordered a sequestration of $230 billion for each year through 2034, the ordered reductions in Medicare spending would increase to about $75 billion in 2034 and would total roughly $490 billion over the 2027–2034 period." \[Letter to Rep. Brendan Boyle – Congressional Budget Office, [5/20/25](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-05/61423-PAYGO.pdf)\]
