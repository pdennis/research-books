We talked a little bit about the the cuts to the CDC and beyond DOGE has implemented. But when you look at other things, too, the foreign policy tilts, you know, more towards Russia and away from the EU and Europe. Some of the tariffs that could cause some pain to consumers here. I know that there's farmers and manufacturers who welcome it, but it's going to cause higher prices from everything from from coke cans to construction beams if they go through. But are there issues that you're worried about?&nbsp;JONES: But you've also seen companies like Apple, who for the first time saying they're going to invest over almost a half a trillion dollars in the United States. And well, his, the goal is to try to get these manufacturing jobs back to the United States. We can't continuously be an importer of all goods and all services. And I think he realizes that. He has a very a very aggressive approach to things. But that's the way he's always approached things and that's the way he's been successful at all the various entities that he's done. […] But so, I don't have an issue with how he's going about things on the world stage, how he's trying to put American jobs first, American manufacturing first, how he has secured the border.” [Burt Jones Interview – Politically Georgia, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/burt-jones-politically-georgia-22725/s-DUEX8s8NjKO?si=da931965015e4d86b6f2d04522e5cdce&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">2/27/25</a>] (AUDIO)&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Trump’s Tariffs Threatened Georgia’s Agricultural Industry, Which Produced “Far More Than The Local Market Demands,” And Relied On Exports To Other Countries, With A “Significant Share” Going To China.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “And Savannah’s booming ports are&nbsp;bracing for a slowdown&nbsp;as tariff threats and other business headwinds exact a toll on global shipping. Georgia imports more from China than from any other country, although the share of Chinese goods coming through the Savannah port is shrinking.&nbsp;Few sectors are more vulnerable than agriculture, Georgia’s largest industry. State farmers produce far more than the local market demands, and much of that is shipped overseas. A significant share goes to China, the epicenter of the trade battle.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-republicans-industries-brace-for-impact-of-trumps-tariffs/LSOO37N5AJDWLB3CV2T3CYC64A/">4/18/25</a>]</p>
