<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In 2025, Trump issued Burt Jones a <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2025/11/10/trump-pardon-of-2020-election-allies-does-not-erase-fulton-county-election-interference-charges/">preemptive pardon</a> for his role as an alternate elector attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Jones wrote a <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/in-georgia-concerted-gop-pushback-blocks-trump-attempts-to-overturn-election/WCRIAROVEZADVLEL5Q6QHY6UFU/">petition</a> calling for the Georgia legislature to appoint alternate electors, and he was one of 16 <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/08/23/case-against-georgias-lieutenant-governor-for-alleged-2020-fake-elector-scheme-awaits-prosecutor/">fake electors</a> who signed a false certification that Trump won the state of Georgia. He also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251202153816/https:/www.ajc.com/politics/election/georgia-2020-election-what-happened/">intended to deliver</a> a letter to Pence urging him to delay the tally of electoral votes, before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251202153816/https:/www.ajc.com/politics/election/georgia-2020-election-what-happened/">deciding against it at last minute.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to his role in attempting to overturn the 2020 election, Jones<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-election-deniers-in-state-senate-stripped-of-chairmanships/KAWCPO4DDBAKLHIMQS3PJ2JKXM/"> lost his position</a> as Chair of the Insurance and Labor Committee, and was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/us/georgia-investigation-trump.html">warned</a> that he could be prosecuted. In 2024, a special prosecutor ultimately <a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-election-investigation-trump-burt-jones-49c8639a11b930066d50f7dc0c6564e0">decided against</a> indicting Jones.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Trump Pardoned Burt Jones For His Role As An Alternate Elector And For Trying To Overturn The 2020 Election&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>Trump Gave Burt Jones A Preemptive Pardon For His Role As An Alternate Elector</h3>
<p><strong>November 2025: Trump Included Jones In His Preemptive Pardon For The Alternate Electors Involved In Attempting To Overturn The 2020 Election.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Georgia Recorder, “Georgia Republicans who came under legal scrutiny after allegedly playing a role in trying to overturn President Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss are celebrating after the president issued a sweeping preemptive pardon […] Georgia’s highest-ranking alternate elector is Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, who participated in the plan while serving as a state senator. A special prosecutor ruled last year that Jones acted within the scope of his authority as a state legislator and that charges&nbsp;should not&nbsp;be brought against him. Trump has endorsed Jones in the 2026 race for governor in Georgia.&nbsp;In a statement following the pardon, campaign spokesperson Kayla Lott characterized the case against Jones as political theater from Willis.&nbsp;‘After being cleared by the state prosecutor, this is the final confirmation that this whole thing was a charade led by Joe Biden and Fani Willis,’ Lott said. ‘They owe the taxpayers an apology and a refund.’” [Georgia Recorder, <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2025/11/10/trump-pardon-of-2020-election-allies-does-not-erase-fulton-county-election-interference-charges/">11/10/25</a>]</p>

<h3>Burt Jones Lost Leadership Positions And Was Almost Prosecuted For His Involvement In Attempts To overturn The 2020 Election</h3>
<h4>The Bulwark Called Jones One Of Georgia’s “Top Election Deniers”</h4>
<p><strong>The Bulwark: “Kemp Stands Shoulder-To-Shoulder With One Of The State’s Top Election Deniers,” Burt Jones. </strong>According to The Bulwark, “Georgia Republican Governor Brian Kemp gets a lot of credit for resisting pressure from former President Donald Trump to ‘find the votes’ to flip the 2020 election results in his state. But that was then. Today, Kemp stands shoulder-to-shoulder with one of the state’s top election deniers. That man is his running mate, the GOP candidate for lieutenant governor, Burt Jones.” [The Bulwark,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/brian-kemps-running-mate-is-a-fake-elector/">9/1/22</a>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Jones Wanted To Appoint Alternate Electors In Georgia And Was Among 16 Fake Electors Who Signed Certificates Declaring Trump The Winner Of Georgia</h4>
<p><strong>December 2020: Jones And Three Other Republican State Senators Wrote A Petition Calling For A Special Session So The Republican Legislature Could “Take Back The Power To Appoint Electors.”&nbsp;</strong>According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “And four Republican state senators — Brandon Beach, Greg Dolezal, Burt Jones and William Ligon —&nbsp;drafted a petition&nbsp;seeking a special session claiming ‘systemic’ election failures. It&nbsp;seeks&nbsp;to allow the Republican-controlled Legislature to ‘take back the power to appoint electors.’” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/in-georgia-concerted-gop-pushback-blocks-trump-attempts-to-overturn-election/WCRIAROVEZADVLEL5Q6QHY6UFU/">12/7/20</a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Governor Kemp Rejected The Petition And Asserted That Choosing Alternative Electors Was “Not An Option Under State Or Federal Law.”</strong> According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “And state GOP leaders united to bury the idea of a special session that would seek to switch Georgia’s 16 electors from Biden to Trump.&nbsp;‘Simply put, this is not an option under state or federal law,’ Gov. Brian Kemp pointedly told lawmakers in Athens. ‘The statute is clear. The Legislature can only direct an alternative method for choosing presidential electors if the election was not able to be held on the date set by federal law.’” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/in-georgia-concerted-gop-pushback-blocks-trump-attempts-to-overturn-election/WCRIAROVEZADVLEL5Q6QHY6UFU/">12/7/20</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2020: Jones Was Among 16 Illegitimate Electors Who Signed False Certificates Declaring Trump The Winner Of Georgia.</strong> According to the Georgia Recorder, “Several days ago, the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia began the search for a special prosecutor to review Jones’ involvement as a state senator at the time of the election in November 2020. Jones was among 16 illegitimate GOP electors who signed false certificates declaring Trump the Georgia winner, despite confirmed election results showing Biden by nearly 12,000 votes ahead of the incumbent.” [Georgia Recorder, <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/08/23/case-against-georgias-lieutenant-governor-for-alleged-2020-fake-elector-scheme-awaits-prosecutor/">8/23/23</a>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Jones Planned To Urge Pence To Delay The Tally Of Electoral College Votes</h4>
<p><strong>January 2021: Jones Signed A Letter “Urging Pence To Delay The Tally Of Electoral College Votes For 12 Days ‘For Further Investigation Of Fraud, Irregularities, And Misconduct,’” And Intended To Personally Deliver The Letter To Pence.</strong> According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “On Jan. 2, some Georgia legislators prepared a letter urging Pence to delay the tally of Electoral College votes for 12 days ‘for further investigation of fraud, irregularities and misconduct’ in the November election. Legislators from&nbsp;four other states&nbsp;that Biden won wrote similar letters.&nbsp;Among the 16 Georgia legislators who signed the letter were Sens. Brandon Beach, Greg Dolezal, Burt Jones and William Ligon, who had&nbsp;spent weeks&nbsp;calling for the General Assembly to&nbsp;intervene on Trump’s behalf. The letter appeared on Ligon’s Senate stationery. Jones planned to deliver it to the vice president personally a few days later.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “Inside The Georgia 2020 Election,” Archived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251202153816/https:/www.ajc.com/politics/election/georgia-2020-election-what-happened/">12/2/25</a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Jones Did Not Deliver The Letter To Pence As Intended Because He “Could Tell It Wasn’t Going To Happen,” Instead Leaving The Letter With An Uber Driver.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “Jones caught an Uber to the dinner. He asked the driver to wait and keep the Pence letter. He wanted to assess the vice president’s mood before delivering it.&nbsp;‘I was just reading his body language and everything else,’&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;Pence had&nbsp;already told Trump&nbsp;he didn’t have the legal authority to block the certification of Biden’s victory. Jones said he could tell it would be ‘a tall order’ to convince the vice president, and he decided not to deliver the letter.&nbsp;‘So I had it sitting out in the car,’ he said. ‘I never did bring it in. I could tell that it wasn’t going to happen.’” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “Inside The Georgia 2020 Election,” Archived&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251202153816/https:/www.ajc.com/politics/election/georgia-2020-election-what-happened/">12/2/25</a>]</li>

<h4>Jones Was Removed As Chair Of The Insurance And Labor Committee After Trying To Overturn The 2020 Election</h4>
<p><strong>January 2021: Jones Was Removed As Chair Of The Insurance And Labor Committee In The Georgia State Senate After Backing Attempts To Overturn The 2020 Presidential Election.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “The Republican rift in the state Senate came to a head Tuesday when Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan demoted three Republican senators who have backed attempts to overturn the presidential vote in Georgia over baseless allegations of irregularities.&nbsp;When the bloodletting was over, state Sens. Brandon Beach of Alpharetta, Matt Brass of Newnan and Burt Jones of Jackson were sapped of their political influence on the second day of the winter session. As our AJC colleague Maya T. Prabhu reports, Duncan stripped Beach of his chairmanship of the Transportation Committee, while Jones will no longer lead the Insurance and Labor Committee. Neither will serve as even a rank-and-file member on the two panels they once led.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-election-deniers-in-state-senate-stripped-of-chairmanships/KAWCPO4DDBAKLHIMQS3PJ2JKXM/">1/13/21</a>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Jones Claimed He Was Labeled An “Outcast” For Speaking Out About Election Integrity</h4>
<p><strong>July 2021: Jones Attended The Women For America First’s “Election Integrity Event” In Rome, Georgia, And Claimed He And Two Other State Senators Who Attempted To Overturn The 2020 Election Were Labeled As “Outcasts Because We Spoke Out.”&nbsp;</strong>According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “The organizers at the door handed out soft-pink ‘Trump Won’ signs to each attendee. An out-of-state radio host spouted far-right conspiracies. Speaker after speaker insisted that Joe Biden couldn’t have won the November election and that Georgia couldn’t be a blue state.&nbsp;The gathering this week in Rome might seem like a pro-Donald Trump fantasy convention. But this was no fringe group. Some of the biggest stars in the Georgia GOP were in attendance. State Sen. Burt Jones, a wealthy executive who is&nbsp;expected&nbsp;to run for lieutenant governor, was given a hero’s welcome.&nbsp;[…] At the event in Rome, billed as an ‘election integrity’ town hall that was hosted by Women for America First, organizers fumed at Kemp for not calling a special legislative session to invalidate the November election. Others talked of decertifying Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff’s win, which is not legally possible.&nbsp;And the crowd of about 100 rewarded Burt Jones with loud cheers as he recounted how he and two other GOP state senators&nbsp;were stripped of powerful posts&nbsp;because they had aggressively pushed to overturn the presidential vote.&nbsp;‘We were the outcasts because we spoke out. But it hasn’t stopped us,’ Jones said. ‘We’re still talking because the people are on our side.’” [Atlanta Journal Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-republicans-center-campaigns-on-false-claims-of-election-fraud/JNRJYNAG6BD5JC5BB2TQG3LYGA/">7/14/21</a>]</p>

<h4>A Georgia Prosecutor Warned Jones He Could Be Indicted For His Role In The Efforts To Overturn The Election</h4>
<p><strong>July 2022: Fulton County Prosecutor Fani T. Willis Sent Jones A Letter Informing Him He “Could Be Indicted” For His Role In The Efforts To Overturn The 2020 Election.&nbsp;</strong>According to The New York Times, “The breadth, speed and seriousness of the criminal&nbsp;investigation&nbsp;into election meddling by former President Donald J.&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;and his associates in&nbsp;Georgia&nbsp;were underscored on Friday by the revelation that two pro-Trump&nbsp;state senators and the chair of the state Republican Party were sent letters by an Atlanta prosecutor informing them they could be indicted, according to a person familiar with the inquiry. The Fulton County prosecutor,&nbsp;Fani T. Willis, is also weighing whether to subpoena Mr.&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;himself and seek his testimony before a grand jury, just days after she subpoenaed seven of his advisers, including Rudolph W. Giuliani and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, in an&nbsp;investigation&nbsp;into efforts to overturn Mr.&nbsp;Trump’s 2020 election loss in&nbsp;Georgia. […] The letters to David Shafer, the Georgia Republican Party chair, and State Senators Burt Jones and Brandon Beach were first reported by&nbsp;Yahoo News.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/us/georgia-investigation-trump.html">7/15/22</a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Willis Said The Alternate Pro-Trump Electors, Including Jones, Were “Part Of A Multi-State, Coordinated Plan By The Trump Campaign To Influence The Results Of The November 2020 Election.”&nbsp;</strong>According to The New York Times, “Mr. Shafer and Mr. Jones were&nbsp;among the 16 alternate pro-Trump electors in Georgia; the state’s official electors cast their votes in the Electoral College for Joseph R. Biden Jr.&nbsp;Mr. Beach’s name was mentioned in an email that a&nbsp;Georgia&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;campaign official sent to the pro-Trump&nbsp;electors on Dec. 13, 2020, the day before the electors met at the&nbsp;Georgia&nbsp;State Capitol. That email, which was described in articles by The Washington Post and CNN last month, instructed them to meet with ‘complete secrecy and discretion,’ and advised them to tell Capitol security personnel that they were attending a meeting with Mr. Beach and Mr. Jones. […] But Ms. Willis’s office, in recent subpoenas to potential witnesses in the case, has characterized the pro-Trump&nbsp;electors as being ‘part of a multi-state, coordinated plan by the Trump campaign to influence the results of the November 2020 election in&nbsp;Georgia&nbsp;and elsewhere.’” [New York Times,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/us/georgia-investigation-trump.html">7/15/22</a>]</li>

<h4>A Georgia Special Prosecutor Later Decided Not To Pursue Charges Against Jones</h4>
<p><strong>September 2024: Executive Director Of The Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council Of Georgia Announced He Would Not Prosecute Jones For His Role In Attempting To Overturn The 2020 Election.&nbsp;</strong>According to the Associate Press, “A special prosecutor has decided not to pursue charges against Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones over efforts to overturn Donald Trump’s 2020 presidential election loss in the state. Pete Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia on Friday announced that he had decided not to bring the matter to a grand jury. Skandalakis appointed himself to handle the matter in April, nearly two years after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was barred from prosecuting Jones as part of her election interference case against former Trump and others.” [Associated Press,&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-election-investigation-trump-burt-jones-49c8639a11b930066d50f7dc0c6564e0">9/13/24</a>]</p>
