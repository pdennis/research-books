#### Opposition to gender transition procedures for minors

**Luna Opposed Gender Transition Treatments For Children** According to voteannapaulina.com, "Luna echoes other Republicans in opposing childrens' access to gender transition treatments, \[...\] 'I don't care what someone does as an adult,' Luna tells me. 'Just leave the kids out of it and don't force people to call you things they don't agree with.'" \[voteannapaulina.com, [10/14/24](https://www.voteannapaulina.com/post/the-influencer-who-came-to-congress)\]
