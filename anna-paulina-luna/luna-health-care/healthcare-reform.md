# Universal Health Care and Health Insurance Reform

### Affordable Health Care Access

#### Opposition to single-payer systems

**Luna Advocated Free-Market Approaches To Healthcare And Student Debt** According to Daily Wire, "With healthcare for example, if we were to enable more insurance companies to come forward with plans for healthcare coverage and get rid of some of the red-tape doctors face when opening their own practices, it would make the market competitive, meaning the prices for these plans and walk-in clinics would drop. In an instance of student loan debt, I joined the military and worked my way through college paying for it via the GI-bill." \[Daily Wire, [9/19/19](https://www.dailywire.com/news/latina-veteran-launches-gop-congressional-bid-ryan-saavedra)\]
