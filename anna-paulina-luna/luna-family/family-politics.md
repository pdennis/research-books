**2023: Luna's Spokesperson Discredited Estranged Family's Claims** According to Newsweek, "Luna's spokesperson Edie Heipel told Newsweek on Saturday that the family members that the Post cited are the congresswoman's 'estranged family members.' 'The sources WAPO used made bizarre claims and we find it ironic this is one of their sources. We don't take anything they say seriously and Rep. Luna doesn't associate with them as they are estranged family members -- Rep. Luna's mother has also confirmed this,' Luna's spokesperson said." \[Newsweek, [2/10/23](https://www.newsweek.com/anna-paulina-luna-slammed-over-report-she-lied-about-being-jewish-1780538)\]
