### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna appeared on the QAnon-linked program "Patriots' Soapbox" in 2020, where she praised the hosts and sought support for her congressional campaign ([Media Matters](https://www.mediamatters.org/congress/florida-gop-congressional-candidate-anna-paulina-luna-appeared-qanon-program-and-praised)).

-   Her participation on a QAnon-affiliated platform raises potential concerns about her alignment or engagement with extremist online communities.

-   Luna's Twitter account was temporarily suspended twice in 2020, indicating contentious interactions with social media platforms ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60VP-4GY1-DYTM-N1XW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna's campaign accused Twitter of deliberately suppressing minority, conservative, and millennial voices, reflecting an adversarial relationship with the platform ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60VP-4GY1-DYTM-N1XW-00000-00&context=1519360)).
