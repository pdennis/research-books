# Engagement with News Media and Commentary

### Summary

-   Rep. Anna Paulina Luna has publicly criticized mainstream, or "legacy," media, claiming it indoctrinates protesters against Republicans and former President Trump, characterizing such coverage as fearmongering ([Fox News interview, 4/21/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMP-VSG3-RRVV-80CK-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna advocates for the importance of Fox News and social media platform X as tools to push back against what she views as misinformation and to counteract media-driven narratives ([Fox News interview, 4/21/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FN6-JC53-RT1P-44FS-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   MSNBC reporter Julio Ricardo Varela controversially linked Luna to Turning Point USA, labeling the organization a "MAGA white supremacist cult," which sparked debate and criticism ([Free Press Tampa, 1/15/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67BX-86D1-DXVP-V0GM-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna has strongly rejected media portrayals connecting her or Turning Point USA to white supremacy, accusing MSNBC of spreading "twisted lies" and criticizing left-leaning media for focusing on her race ([Free Press Tampa, 1/15/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67BX-86D1-DXVP-V0GM-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna maintains a recurring presence on conservative media platforms, such as Fox News and Fox Business, indicating a strategy to engage with audiences and shape media narratives ([Fox Business Tonight, 1/16/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67BD-D241-F053-D2YB-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   There is a potential vulnerability in Luna's heavy reliance on conservative media, which could limit her messaging reach or reinforce perceptions of partisanship.
