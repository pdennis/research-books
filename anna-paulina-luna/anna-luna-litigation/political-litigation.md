# Political Litigation and Congressional Legal Actions

### Summary

-   Luna's lawsuit against the Department of Defense over the COVID-19 vaccine mandate may draw criticism for challenging a public health policy, especially as it centers on religious exemptions and military discipline ([Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/anna-paulina-luna-husband-andrew-232442483.html)).

-   Publicly accusing a sitting judge (Judge Loar) of incompetence and demanding resignation invites scrutiny of Luna's approach to the judiciary and may be seen as overstepping legislative boundaries ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BBT-XC01-JCBJ-Y17Y-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Connecting a judicial ruling directly to Audrey Petersen's murder could be perceived as inflammatory or opportunistic, risking backlash for politicizing a tragic event ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BBT-XC01-JCBJ-Y17Y-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Framing legal and political actions as responses to personal or family experiences, such as her husband's military career, may lead to accusations of personal bias or conflicts of interest.

-   Luna's willingness to engage in highly public legal confrontations may alienate colleagues or constituents seeking a more measured approach to political disputes and judiciary matters.

### Luna's Involvement in Congressional Investigations

#### Advocacy for Impeachment Proceedings

**Luna Sued DoD Over COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate Impact With Husband** According to Yahoo, "Luna stated in an interview with Washington Examiner, 'It seems like they were trying to essentially basically destroy Andy's career.' Their lawsuit challenges the vaccine mandate's impact on religious freedom and service member rights." \[Yahoo, [4/1/25](https://www.yahoo.com/news/anna-paulina-luna-husband-andrew-232442483.html)\]

#### Efforts to Censure Political Figures

**February 2024: Anna Paulina Luna Called For Judge Loar's Resignation** According to Tampa Bay Times, "Republican U.S. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna issued a statement Wednesday calling for Loar to resign, saying she 'personally experienced this judge's shortcomings in her rulings.'" \[Tampa Bay Times, [2/15/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BBT-XC01-JCBJ-Y17Y-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**February 2024: Anna Paulina Luna Blamed Judge Loar's Ruling For Audrey Petersen's Death** According to Tampa Bay Times, "In her statement Wednesday, Luna said Petersen was 'brutally murdered' as a result of Loar's 'completely flawed ruling.' 'I am calling for Judge Loar's immediate resignation,' Luna said in the statement. 'As a result of her poor judgment, she has failed residents in Pinellas County and failed victims of domestic violence.'" \[Tampa Bay Times, [2/15/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BBT-XC01-JCBJ-Y17Y-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
