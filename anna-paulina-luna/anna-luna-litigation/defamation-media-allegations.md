# Defamation, Media, and Public Allegations

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna has been involved in a series of highly publicized and sometimes unsubstantiated allegations against political rivals, including claims that Roger Stone tried to poison her and that primary opponents plotted to murder her---allegations that law enforcement found to be baseless ([Central Florida Post](https://centralfloridapost.com/2021/07/13/anna-paulina-luna-roger-stone-tried-to-poison-me/), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6323-RDC1-DYTM-N50P-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Repeated fact-checking and corrections by major news outlets, such as The Washington Post, have cast doubt on Luna's biographical and background claims, with family members contradicting her accounts and reports raising issues of potential exaggeration ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67KX-D231-DYTM-N14V-00000-00&context=1519360), [Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67N3-KNT1-DYJM-M4M0-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna's responses to critical media coverage have included accusations of political bias, racism, and coordinated attacks by the press, as well as threats of legal action and demands for retractions---actions that both energize supporters and risk appearing overly combative or evasive ([Fox News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67HR-83F1-JCS1-617T-00000-00&context=1519360), [The Free Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67KV-9RB1-JBCN-4294-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Legal avenues---such as restraining orders and lawsuits---have been frequently pursued by Luna in response to perceived threats or reputational harm, but several of her cases and allegations have been dismissed or closed without action ([Orlando Local News](https://orlandolocalnews.com/former-stripper-anna-paulina-luna-mayerhoffer-to-join-dc-draino-for-tpusa-pep-rally), [Central Florida Post](https://centralfloridapost.com/2021/12/14/anna-paulina-luna-gone-wild-lies-plague-campaign-of-former-stripper/)).

-   Significant campaign resources have been spent on legal fees related to public accusations and defamation disputes, raising questions about prioritization and the impact on political credibility ([Central Florida Post](https://centralfloridapost.com/2021/12/14/anna-paulina-luna-gone-wild-lies-plague-campaign-of-former-stripper/)).
