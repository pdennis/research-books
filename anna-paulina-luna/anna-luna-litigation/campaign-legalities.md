# Campaign Conduct and Election-Related Legalities

### Legal Review of Campaign Practices

**2021: Anna Paulina Luna Reportedly Spent \$150,000 In Campaign Funds On Legal Fees** According to a blog post by Francisco Gonzalez on American Action News, "her biography, history, and temperament are already the subject of criticism by many conservatives and those in the America First Movement, reveal a \$150,000 dirty trick. In fact, there could be some serious ethical violations as she used that amount of campaign funds on legal fees." \[Blog Post - Francisco Gonzalez on American Action News, [10/18/21](https://americanactionnews.com/media/2021/10/18/anna-paulina-lunas-150000-dirty-trick-rs-fg/)\]
