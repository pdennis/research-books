### Challenges to Luna's Biography

**2021: Anna Paulina Luna Falsely Claimed Combat Duty In Military Service, Blog Alleged** According to a blog post by Francisco Gonzalez on American Action News, "her widespread use of a photograph of her in U.S. Marine fatigues and brandishing a military-style weapon, combined with her claim that 'you can't understand the concept of freedom being paid for with blood unless you've actually been there,' \[is\] a very clear case of stolen valor. Falsely claiming combat duty is specifically prohibited under Florida State law." \[Blog Post - Francisco Gonzalez on American Action News, [10/18/21](https://americanactionnews.com/media/2021/10/18/anna-paulina-lunas-150000-dirty-trick-rs-fg/)\]
