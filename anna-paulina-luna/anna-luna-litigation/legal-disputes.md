# Personal Lawsuits and Legal Disputes

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna has repeatedly sought protective orders and stalking injunctions against various individuals---including ex-partners, political opponents, and even family members---across several states; many of these were either dismissed or found unsubstantiated by law enforcement ([Central Florida Post](https://centralfloridapost.com/2022/05/11/anna-paulina-luna-has-decades-long-history-of-abusing-court-issued-protective-orders/), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:63X6-F5R1-DYTM-N32X-00000-00&context=1519360), [Historica Wiki](https://historica.fandom.com/wiki/Anna_Paulina_Luna)).

-   Luna's most high-profile legal dispute involved her obtaining a temporary restraining order against Republican primary opponent William Braddock after alleging he plotted to kill her, based on recorded threats; the injunction was later dismissed due to lack of evidence of repeated harassment, and Braddock denied the allegations ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:63P7-8211-JCBJ-Y32F-00000-00&context=1519360), [CNN](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:62YH-MVF1-JB20-G2FJ-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna has been both plaintiff and defendant in civil lawsuits, including a 2022 suit stemming from a dog bite incident at a fishing tournament; Luna and her campaign were eventually dismissed from the case, with liability remaining only for her husband ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67X5-4JT1-DYTM-N0MR-00000-00&context=1519360), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65XS-NY11-DYTM-N04K-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She and her husband filed a now-dismissed lawsuit against the Department of Defense challenging its COVID-19 vaccine mandate on religious grounds ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBR-K961-F03F-K42D-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerability: Critics and some media reports allege Luna has used court-issued protective orders inappropriately or strategically, which may raise concerns about the credibility or motivation behind her legal actions ([Central Florida Post](https://centralfloridapost.com/2022/05/11/anna-paulina-luna-has-decades-long-history-of-abusing-court-issued-protective-orders/), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:63X6-F5R1-DYTM-N32X-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna has publicly attributed an increase in threats and harassment against her to both heightened political rhetoric and alleged doxxing by opponents, drawing significant law enforcement attention ([Islander News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0R-MDM1-DXVP-T0T3-00000-00&context=1519360), [FBN Cavuto](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0R-YPD1-JBHT-D206-00000-00&context=1519360)).
