# Legal Immigration and Reform Proposals

### Summary

-   Rep. Anna Paulina Luna filed the House version of the Refugees Using Legal Entry Safely (RULES) Act to restrict the current asylum process, declaring an end to "open-border chaos" ([Florida Politics](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/718629-anna-paulina-luna-seeks-significant-restrictions-on-immigrants-claiming-asylum/)).

-   Luna partnered with Senator Moreno to target fraud and abuse in the asylum system, emphasizing that the U.S. should not be a "free-for-all" for illegal immigration ([Florida Politics](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/718629-anna-paulina-luna-seeks-significant-restrictions-on-immigrants-claiming-asylum/)).

-   The proposed legislation would restrict asylum claims to those who enter at legal ports of entry and prohibit the release or parole of claimants into the U.S. before their cases are adjudicated in court ([Florida Politics](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/718629-anna-paulina-luna-seeks-significant-restrictions-on-immigrants-claiming-asylum/)).

-   It would also ban denied asylum seekers from reapplying and prevent anyone with a previous illegal entry from receiving asylum in the future ([Florida Politics](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/718629-anna-paulina-luna-seeks-significant-restrictions-on-immigrants-claiming-asylum/)).

-   Potential vulnerabilities include limiting humanitarian access for individuals with legitimate claims who previously entered illegally or whose initial claims were denied, raising concerns among immigrant advocates.

### Comprehensive Immigration Reform Initiatives

#### Calls for System Overhaul

### Stance on Legal Immigration Processes

#### Support for Regulatory Enforcement

**1/31/25: Luna's Legislation Proposed Restricting Asylum To Legal Ports Of Entry And Ending Parole/Release Pending Adjudication** According to Florida Politics, "The bill would restrict asylum claims only to those entering the country at legal ports of entry.
