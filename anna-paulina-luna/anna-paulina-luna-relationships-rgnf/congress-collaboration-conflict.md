### Conflicts with Party Leaders

**2024: Anna Paulina Luna Expressed Concern About Timing Of Speaker Ouster Discussions** In an interview with Fox Business, Anna Paulina Luna said, "I think right now would be not good timing. I do believe there runs a risk of us losing the House if we have another speaker debacle. And so I haven't fully decided on where I'm at on that. But what I can tell you is, when I go back home and when I'm talking to my constituents, they're not for sure over the moon about vacating him, although he's not really delivered on some promises that he made. They're more concerned that we're going to lose the House, which could be a very bad thing for us all in November, if that happens." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with Fox Business (Neil Cavuto), [4/16/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5B16-KY61-JCRM-B090-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
