# Relationships with Media, Activist Groups, and the Public

### Summary

-   Frequent, intense criticism of media and Democratic opponents may alienate moderate voters and reinforce perceptions of partisanship, including repeated allegations of media bias and election interference ([Media Matters](https://www.mediamatters.org/congress/florida-gop-congressional-candidate-anna-paulina-luna-appeared-qanon-program-and-praised), [Political Transcript Wire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DD2-YFD1-JBHT-D562-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Unsubstantiated claims regarding election integrity, government actions, and media censorship risk undermining credibility with broader audiences ([Fox News Laura Ingraham](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BPM-2WJ1-F15W-H00C-00000-00&context=1519360), [Media Matters](https://www.mediamatters.org/congress/florida-gop-congressional-candidate-anna-paulina-luna-appeared-qanon-program-and-praised)).

-   Strained or confrontational relationships with major news outlets---such as declining to comment or posting reporter emails online---could foster negative coverage and questions about transparency ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/01/anna-paulina-luna-whitney-fox/)).

-   Controversial or inflammatory remarks about opponents, including past comparisons and sweeping criticism of Democratic leaders, may be repeatedly referenced by critics or political adversaries ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6781-SHR1-DYTM-N4BG-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Persistent focus on culture war topics---such as accusations related to Christian and Hispanic values, transgender messaging, and Biden administration actions---could both mobilize a core base and heighten polarization, limiting crossover appeal ([Fox News Laura Ingraham](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BPP-WRJ1-DY0W-4493-00000-00&context=1519360)).
