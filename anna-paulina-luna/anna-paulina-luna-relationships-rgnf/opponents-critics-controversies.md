**2024: Anna Paulina Luna Recounted Being Subject To False Allegations Herself** In an interview with CNN, Anna Paulina Luna said, "when I was first elected to Congress, I think it's incredibly important for women out there to know, I was only a few months pregnant. I had a reporter come up to me and ask me how many members of Congress I had had sex with, also alleging that I had a relationship with Matt Gaetz, which was categorically false. But the reason why they did that is because I was standing up against the machine that exists here in Washington, D.C. So be aware that these types of smear campaigns do exist." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with CNN, [11/19/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DG6-92V1-JBHT-D4P7-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
