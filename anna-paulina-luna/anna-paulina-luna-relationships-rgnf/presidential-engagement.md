# Engagement with Presidents and Administrations

### Support for President Trump

**2024: Anna Paulina Luna Criticized U.S. Foreign Policy Toward Iran And Israel And Cited Support For Trump** In an interview with Fox Business, Anna Paulina Luna said, "Neil, when you had the Biden administration back in last year, September 11, authorize billions of dollars for Iran, engage in hostage negotiations, and then you saw the attack in October, and then ultimately this attack again by Iran, we're not looking like we're in a strong foreign policy perspective. And so, as you know, Neil, that's exactly why I have been so vocal about the upcoming election this November and my support for President Trump." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with Fox Business (Neil Cavuto), [4/16/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5B16-KY61-JCRM-B090-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
