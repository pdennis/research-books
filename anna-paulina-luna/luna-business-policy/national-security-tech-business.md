# National Security, Technology, and Business Policy

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna publicly supported President Trump's reciprocal tariff policies, arguing they would incentivize other countries like China to lower tariffs and ultimately benefit the U.S. economy ([NBC - 8 WFLA, 4/3/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FGG-XV53-S04K-T1K0-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna criticized the Department of Justice's action against SpaceX over its hiring practices, defending the right to prioritize American citizens and framing DOJ intervention as government overreach ([Free Press, 8/27/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6920-Y2G1-DXVP-T1JB-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She pledged to introduce legislation blocking federal funding for the DOJ's lawsuit against SpaceX, further aligning herself with pro-business and technology sector interests ([Free Press, 8/27/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6920-Y2G1-DXVP-T1JB-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna criticized U.S. employment trends that favor foreign-born workers, expressing concern about American wages being suppressed and the vulnerability of immigrant workers ([Fox News, 9/6/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CX9-FXF1-JDPT-T17V-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Her positions highlight a consistent emphasis on economic nationalism, protection of U.S. workers, and skepticism toward both international trade barriers and federal regulatory actions.

-   These stances may present vulnerabilities regarding relations with business sectors dependent on global labor and trade, and could be viewed as controversial by advocates for immigrant rights or international cooperation.

**2025: Luna Supported Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs And Defended Economic Policy** According to NBC - 8 WFLA, "Luna said she trusts the president's handling of the economy and agrees with the recently announced reciprocal tariffs.

'In the long run, from our perspective, it would actually make goods cheaper because then those countries will drop the tariffs and help bolster the economy.'" \[NBC - 8 WFLA: Web Edition Articles (Florida), [4/3/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FGG-XV53-S04K-T1K0-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
