# National Security and Defense Policy

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna has consistently criticized bipartisan U.S. foreign policy, particularly prolonged military involvement and "nation-building" in the Middle East, advocating for a focus on American interests and a realistic approach to national security ([Free Press, 3/16/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67T1-4RG1-JBCN-31RD-00000-00&context=1519360)).

But we are running out of time. \[...\] It's an absolute disgrace, and as a prominent Tampa Bay resident recently said in the Wall Street Journal, it is to the eternal shame of the United States of America. It's a disaster. It's heartbreaking. And it's angering. And the morale of our troops is in shambles. They have been betrayed by our leaders after sacrificing so much." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with Florida Politics, [9/5/21](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/455163-a-tough-conversation-with-anna-paulina-luna/)\]

**2023: Anna Paulina Luna Supported U.S. Troop Withdrawal From Syria** According to an opinion piece by Liam Edgar in Free Press (Tampa, Florida), Luna wrote, "the troop pullout \[from Syria is\] one of many necessary steps to redirect our nation's foreign policy away from a failed internationalist foreign policy consensus on both sides of the aisle that for a quarter century has wasted our resources and carelessly spilled the blood of our soldiers across the globe." \[Liam Edgar - Free Press (Tampa, Florida), [3/16/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67T1-4RG1-JBCN-31RD-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Approach to National Security Threats

#### Views on National Defense Spending

**December 2024: Luna Expressed Support For Trump's Foreign Policy Approach** According to Fox News, "It's the alpha energy that the world needs right now. You know, after four years of Biden and terrible foreign policy, I think not just the United States, but the world, was ready for someone to take the reins and get us back to some form of normalcy, because we could not handle another four years. I did believe that if Trump didn't win, I believe that we would have ended up in World War Three." \[Fox News JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME, [12/9/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DM5-RPV1-F072-X27M-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2023: Anna Paulina Luna Attributed Rise Of ISIS To U.S. Middle East Policy Under Obama** According to an opinion piece by Liam Edgar in Free Press (Tampa, Florida), Luna argued, "Obama 'raised false hopes among a certain section of Syrians that only extended the civil war, and pushed Russia to defend its warm water port in the Mediterranean and get involved militarily. Worse, it resulted in a civil war which directly resulted in the rise of ISIS.'" \[Liam Edgar - Free Press (Tampa, Florida), [3/16/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67T1-4RG1-JBCN-31RD-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

It is to focus on American borders, and law and order in American cities." \[Liam Edgar - Free Press (Tampa, Florida), [3/16/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67T1-4RG1-JBCN-31RD-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**February 2023: Luna Became Involved After Disclosure From Eglin Air Force Base** According to Tampa Bay Times, "Luna first became involved in February when she was approached by U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, who represents part of the panhandle.

'As a veteran and someone who worked in airfield management, I found this particularly concerning,' Luna said in a statement." \[Tampa Bay Times, [7/27/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68TH-NH51-DYTM-N4YY-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2023: Luna Attempted To Interview Pilots At Air Force Base But Was Denied Access** According to Tampa Bay Times, "Gaetz, Luna and Burchett traveled to the Air Force base to interview pilots and collect evidence.

**2023: Luna Stressed Bipartisan Nature Of UFO Hearings** According to Tampa Bay Times, "The hearing and interest in the topic among House members has been a bipartisan effort. Florida Democratic U.S. House members Maxwell Frost and Jared Moskowitz were also involved in the questioning, as was New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another younger legislator to whom Luna has frequently been compared." \[Tampa Bay Times, [7/27/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68TH-NH51-DYTM-N4YY-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2023: Luna Asserted Legislative Branch Requires Full UAP Transparency** According to Tampa Bay Times, "'The reason(s) why there is such strong bipartisan support for this investigation are the whistleblower concerns and a government that has become so large that it no longer respects the authority of the legislative branch,' Luna said in a statement. 'Our clearances are top-secret, and we need to know. We represent the American people and will continue to work with our Democratic colleagues to push for full transparency.'" \[Tampa Bay Times, [7/27/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68TH-NH51-DYTM-N4YY-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

#### Approach to China and Technology

**2023: Anna Paulina Luna Criticized Biden's Response To Chinese Balloon Incident** In an interview with Fox Business, Anna Paulina Luna said, "I think that it really underplays the threat that China poses to this country. \[...\] the fact is, is that this entire balloon traversed the country, starting in Alaska, dropping down through Canada, and, as we saw, Montana to really the East Coast. I do think that a better option potentially would have been to capture it. But, at the time, from my understanding, we didn't have the technology to do that. \[...\] We need to decouple. And I think that we need to look at them as a serious threat. We know, by 2027, they're going to be militarily dwarfing us. And, by 2030, they want to be a world superpower." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with Fox Business, [2/10/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67J5-JVK1-JBHT-D0NJ-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

But, at the time, from my understanding, we didn't have the technology to do that. I think that now that that was, one, a wakeup call for the DOD, but then also to remember China's economically competing with us. We need to decouple. And I think that we need to look at them as a serious threat. We know, by 2027, they're going to be militarily dwarfing us. And, by 2030, they want to be a world superpower." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with Cavuto Cavuto, [2/10/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67HK-4NF1-JCS1-6000-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

By that logic, the entire planet demands an American forward presence." \[Liam Edgar - Free Press (Tampa, Florida), [3/16/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67T1-4RG1-JBCN-31RD-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

In short, nothing in the region demands constant troop deployment and endless war.'" \[Liam Edgar - Free Press (Tampa, Florida), [3/16/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67T1-4RG1-JBCN-31RD-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**April 2024: Luna Expressed Concern That Americans Fear Getting Drafted Due To Weak Foreign Policy** According to CQ Transcriptions, Luna said, "There's a lot of people that are afraid of getting drafted. I'm hearing that. I actually just addressed a war college recently. And to hear those service members actually think that they might get drafted, I don't want the American people, I don't want people to have to fear that. So I think that, with what we're seeing out of the White House, we are seeing weak leadership." \[CQ Transcriptions, [4/16/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BTK-NFY1-JDPT-T014-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**June 2024: Luna Claimed Trump Prioritized Concerns Over Russia, Cited Warships Off U.S. Coast** According to Fox News, "LUNA: I think the number one issue that he has is especially concern for what's happening right now with Russia. Obviously, there is the media really silencing what's happening with Russia. Warships off the coast of Cuba and also Florida. But I think more importantly, too, he made sure that the American people would know that what is currently happening in Ukraine and Israel would have never happened under him and he does have a plan and solution in moving forward." \[Fox News JESSE WATTERS PRIMETIME 8:00 PM EST, [6/13/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C80-NYF1-F072-X0DN-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
