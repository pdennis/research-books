# Immigration and Trade Policy

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna's push to attach a strict border security bill (H.R.2) to Ukraine aid exposes her to criticism for potentially holding up international assistance for domestic policy aims ([Fox Business, 4/16/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5B16-KY61-JCRM-B090-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Public statements tying immigration policy and border security to aid for Ukraine might be seen as political maneuvering or transactional politics, raising concerns among moderate voters ([Fox Business, 4/16/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5B16-KY61-JCRM-B090-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna's repeated focus on border security as the top issue for Hispanic voters risks oversimplifying or assuming a uniform perspective within the Hispanic community, which opponents could portray as tone-deaf or pandering ([Fox News Channel, 7/4/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CDF-C361-F15W-H00K-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Her claims that Democratic policies on immigration have "backfired" with Hispanic and Black voters may be challenged by critics as an overgeneralization or lacking sufficient data ([Fox News Channel, 7/4/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CDF-C361-F15W-H00K-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Singular emphasis on border security as an economic issue could open her up to criticism for not addressing the broader complexities of immigration and trade policy ([Fox News Channel, 7/4/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CDJ-62N1-JBHT-D2P9-00000-00&context=1519360)).

### Linking Immigration and Foreign Policy

**2024: Anna Paulina Luna Discussed Possible H.R.2 Border Security Bill Attachment To Ukraine Aid** In an interview with Fox Business, Anna Paulina Luna said, "I actually just left a meeting with the speaker and some of my conservative colleagues that might be a no on this rule. But what I am hearing and what I'm hearing negotiations on, Neil, is to potentially attach H.R.2, which, as you know, was that very strong border security bill, to potentially Ukraine. I don't know where the votes are out on that, but that that is something that's in discussion currently." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with Fox Business (Neil Cavuto), [4/16/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5B16-KY61-JCRM-B090-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Border Security and Immigration Enforcement

#### Advocacy for Enhanced Border Security

**2024: Anna Paulina Luna Claimed Economy And Border Security Were Top Issues For Hispanic Voters** In an interview with Fox News Channel, Anna Paulina Luna said, "number one issues within my community are economy and also, too, border security. So, we're seeing that the pandering that the Biden administration did with the Hispanic voting demographic not only backfired, but again, you are seeing after especially that debate, that there is a massive sweep, not just with the Hispanic voters, but with black voters as well." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with Fox News Channel, [7/4/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CDF-C361-F15W-H00K-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
