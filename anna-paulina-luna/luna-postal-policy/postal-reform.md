# Postal Service Reform and Legislation

### Summary

-   In November 2023, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, along with other Republicans, blocked legislation that would have named a Delray Beach post office after a Holocaust hero ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69KS-S9M1-JCBJ-Y04V-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna also blocked a bill from Rep. Darren Soto to name a post office after Robert Guevara, Osceola County's first Puerto Rican commissioner ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69KS-S9M1-JCBJ-Y04V-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna claimed her own effort to rename a post office after Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Knauss, killed in the 2021 Kabul attack, was itself blocked by a Democratic congresswoman over a personal dispute.

-   As a response to perceived obstruction, Luna announced she would withdraw her support from all post office renaming bills ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69KS-S9M1-JCBJ-Y04V-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The disputes around post office renaming indicate partisan tension and may slow or halt future bipartisan commemorative efforts.
