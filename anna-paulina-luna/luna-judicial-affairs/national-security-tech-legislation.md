# National Security, Technology, and Legislative Procedure

### Stance on Legislative Procedures and Congressional Oversight

#### Proxy Voting and Parental Leave Advocacy

**2024: Luna Argued Her Proxy Voting Proposal Circumvented Constitutional Objections** According to South Florida Sun-Sentinel, "Luna claims she has found a way around that objection. The Constitution states that a quorum must be present for each chamber of Congress to do business. Her legislation would not allow for proxy voting for the quorum call, permitting remote voting only on legislation brought up after that." \[South Florida Sun-Sentinel, [1/20/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B4X-1X41-JBM5-R013-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
