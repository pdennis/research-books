# Judicial System Oversight and Reform

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna consistently called for accountability in the judicial system, advocating for criminal prosecution of officials who violate constitutional rights to restore public trust and prevent a two-tiered justice system ([CQ Transcriptions, 11/10/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DCY-S9R1-F15W-H0CV-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna criticized perceived double standards and conflicts of interest in high-profile cases, including the Trump and Hunter Biden investigations, and raised concerns about the impartiality of the DOJ, FBI, and judiciary ([Political Transcript Wire, 3/21/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67V9-XR41-JBHT-D48B-00000-00&context=1519360); [Fox News, 5/16/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C26-S6D1-F15W-H01B-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She raised ethical concerns about the selective release of ethics committee reports and the credibility of witnesses in congressional investigations, especially surrounding the Matt Gaetz case ([CNN, 11/19/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DG6-92V1-JBHT-D4P7-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna pushed for reforms to the FISA court system, expressing opposition to FISA renewal without privacy protections, citing past FISA abuses and advocating renegotiation for stronger civil liberties ([Fox Business Network, 4/26/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BWR-CCG1-F15W-H00H-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   A potential vulnerability is Luna's stated lack of faith in the DOJ's willingness to act on congressional criminal referrals, raising questions about effective oversight and trust in enforcement institutions ([Political Transcript Wire, 3/28/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BNN-1W91-JBHT-D452-00000-00&context=1519360)).

### Views on FBI, DOJ, and Federal Investigations

#### Claims of Unequal Justice Application

**2024: Anna Paulina Luna Supported Criminal Prosecution To Restore Trust In Institutions** In an interview with CQ Transcriptions, Anna Paulina Luna said, "Yes, ma'am, because you have American -- the American people that would be held to that same standard. So just because these people are political appointees, if they're operating outside of the purview of the Constitution, if they are violating people's rights, they need to be held accountable. So I am not for a two-tiered justice system in this country. I believe that restoring our country, restoring trust in our justice system is going to mean that people will get in trouble, and that's exactly why I believe criminal prosecution would be necessary." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with CQ Transcriptions, [11/10/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DCY-S9R1-F15W-H0CV-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

And so hopefully, at the end of that two year mark, again, that will come back up for renegotiation.
