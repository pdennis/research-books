-   Luna has consistently warned of and denounced alleged voter suppression efforts, urging conservative and independent voters to be vigilant, and has encouraged voter turnout for Republican candidates, particularly Donald Trump ([Fox News interview](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBG-00M1-F15W-H2DD-00000-00&context=1519360), [Fox News' Jesse Watters](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBN-Y4T1-F15W-H322-00000-00&context=1519360)).

### Legislative Initiatives and Policy Positions

#### Proxy Voting and Parental Legislation

**2023: Luna Missed Speaker Removal Vote While On Maternity Leave** According to Florida Politics, "That included last year's successful ouster of Kevin McCarthy, when Luna was out on maternity leave as when U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Fort Walton Beach Republican, made a fateful motion to vacate. She also wasn't casting any votes the day that U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, tried unsuccessfully to remove Johnson." \[Florida Politics, [5/29/24](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/675608-no-24-on-the-list-of-tampa-bays-most-powerful-politicians-anna-paulina-luna/)\]

**2024: Anna Paulina Luna Warned Of False Voter Suppression Efforts Posing As Republican Groups** In an interview with Fox News, Anna Paulina Luna said, "if you are a Republican voter, if you are an independent voter, be aware of voter suppression efforts that are posing as conservative groups, posing as Republican groups that are trying to suppress people from showing up to the polls, sending out false information. There is, I believe, an organization called Center for Voter Integrity that sent out 300 million mailers that inverted Republican policy positions with everyone running for office if they were a Democrat." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with Fox News (Sunday Morning Futures), [11/3/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBG-00M1-F15W-H2DD-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

So vote Trump two days from now." \[Interview - Rep. Anna Paulina Luna with Fox News' Jesse Watters, [11/3/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBN-Y4T1-F15W-H322-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2024: Anna Paulina Luna Characterized SNL's Portrayal Of Kamala Harris As Negative And Lacking Substance** In an interview with Fox News' Jesse Watters, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna said, "'SNL' even in just the way that Kamala portrayed her platform, she didn't really talk anything. She kind of just trashed Trump. They trashed again Trump supporters and making the garbage joke. So I think that again, that's a missed opportunity." \[Interview - Rep. Anna Paulina Luna with Fox News' Jesse Watters, [11/3/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBN-Y4T1-F15W-H322-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
