# Campaign Strategies and Community Outreach

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna's 2024 campaign heavily emphasized grassroots efforts, claiming significant outreach including over 110,000 phone calls and 60,000 doors knocked, which Luna credited for her reelection success ([NBC - 8 WFLA, 11/5/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBY-D8G1-DXVP-T242-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna's campaign messaging focused on winning support from Hispanic, independent, and low-propensity voters, asserting that these groups surged toward the GOP and Trump in critical battleground states ([Fox News, 11/3/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBG-00M1-F15W-H2DD-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The campaign used direct attacks on Democratic opponent Whitney Fox, including an online ad alleging Fox's support for FEMA funding for undocumented immigrants---a claim Fox denied and called a "desperate tactic" ([Tampa Bay Times, 10/24/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBR-K961-F03F-K492-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna criticized Democratic outreach to Hispanic voters, arguing that Vice President Kamala Harris relied on surrogates rather than personally engaging with the community ([Fox News' Jesse Watters, 11/3/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBN-Y4T1-F15W-H322-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerabilities included criticism from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee over Luna's fundraising and focus on "culture wars" rather than key voter issues, as well as reports of campaign tensions, including an alleged physical altercation between campaign staff and an opponent's supporter ([Tampa Bay Times, 4/16/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BTM-0N41-JCBJ-Y008-00000-00&context=1519360), [Sunday Morning Futures, 11/3/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBJ-SRM1-JBHT-D0BP-00000-00&context=1519360)).
