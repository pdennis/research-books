# 2020 Congressional Campaign

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna was a recent transplant to the district, moving to Tampa Bay only in May 2019 before launching her campaign, which critics highlighted as a possible lack of local roots ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:611W-CYD1-DYTM-N0H1-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Opponents accused Luna of changing her name, newly registering as a Republican, and allegedly misrepresenting her political background, raising questions about authenticity ([Floridian Press](https://floridianpress.com/2021/10/makki-accuses-former-obama-supporter-anna-paulina-luna-of-being-a-phony/)).

-   Luna's close alignment with pro-Trump factions and lack of establishment GOP leadership support created divisions within the local Republican base during the primary ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60KY-1NF1-JCBJ-Y17V-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Despite high-profile endorsements and out-raising her Democratic opponent late in the election, Luna was unable to overcome Charlie Crist's name recognition and incumbency, ultimately losing by six points ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:616X-X6P1-JCBJ-Y02V-00000-00&context=1519360)).
