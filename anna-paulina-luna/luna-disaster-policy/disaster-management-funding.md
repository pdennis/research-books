# Legislative Actions and Funding for Disaster Management

### Summary

-   Rep. Anna Paulina Luna has frequently voted against continuing resolutions and budget bills that included FEMA disaster relief funding, favoring instead standalone disaster relief legislation for her district following major hurricanes ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/01/anna-paulina-luna-whitney-fox/), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DP5-TJX3-S60G-M39P-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna has introduced and co-sponsored several bills to bolster disaster funding---including a \$15 billion bipartisan proposal for hurricane and flood relief---and has pushed for FEMA reforms such as monthly flood insurance payment options and a pause on flood payment collections until new structures are implemented ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68RN-WY21-JCBJ-Y2J1-00000-00&context=1519360), [Fox News interview](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5B-H141-F15W-H007-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She has strongly advocated for restricting FEMA aid for undocumented immigrants, publicly supporting and proposing legislative efforts to end such funding ([Fox News interview](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D5B-H141-F15W-H007-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna has worked with federal and state officials---including FEMA, the governor's office, and the White House---both to secure hurricane disaster relief and to address operational issues, such as requesting waivers on FEMA's 50% rule, and to press for faster beach renourishment and debris removal ([NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F12-Y043-RY07-803C-00000-00&context=1519360), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBR-K961-F03F-K42W-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Some vulnerabilities and criticisms have emerged regarding Luna's record, including repeated votes against FEMA funding amid disasters, initial support and subsequent withdrawal from bipartisan relief packages, and constituent concerns over the adequacy and timeliness of federal disaster aid in her district ([NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DB3-BXT1-DXVP-T29T-00000-00&context=1519360), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DP5-TJX3-S60G-M39P-00000-00&context=1519360)).
