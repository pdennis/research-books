### Critique of political manipulation in disaster response

**October 2024: Luna Criticized Congressional Inaction On Hurricane Financial Aid** According to NBC - 8 WFLA: Web Edition Articles, "Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who has also been in talks with Biden about FEMA's response, shares that it is ridiculous that Congress has not yet met to provide more financial aid. 'We've been pushing for a special session even before Milton made landfall after Helene,' Luna said." \[NBC - 8 WFLA: Web Edition Articles, [10/16/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6F-VSH1-DXVP-T23D-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2023-2024: Luna Claimed Federal Hurricane Response Was Slower In Conservative Areas** According to Tampa Bay Times, "Onstage, she claimed, without evidence, that the federal government was intentionally responding more slowly to conservative areas hit hard by Helene." \[Tampa Bay Times, [10/19/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBR-K961-F03F-K42D-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
