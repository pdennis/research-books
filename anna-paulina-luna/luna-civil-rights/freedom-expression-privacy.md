# Positions on Freedom of Expression and Privacy

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna has consistently criticized social media platforms for censorship, citing multiple incidents where her Twitter account was suspended or flagged due to posts about gun rights and sensitive political content ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60W0-2XP1-DYTM-N362-00000-00&context=1519360), [NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6731-FD01-DXVP-V4FC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna strongly supports the right to peaceful protest, especially highlighted in her responses to the potential indictment and arrest of President Trump ([Political Transcript Wire](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67V9-XR41-JBHT-D48B-00000-00&context=1519360), [Fox Business](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67V1-3MH1-JDPT-T0CR-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She has expressed serious concerns about government overreach and privacy violations, vocally opposing FISA reauthorization unless it includes warrant requirements and equal protections for all Americans ([NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BSC-BBP1-DXVP-T28P-00000-00&context=1519360), [FBN: Mornings with Maria](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5G1K-6721-JCRM-B368-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna opposed the Antisemitism Awareness Act of 2024, arguing that its broad definition could classify Bible passages as antisemitic and potentially threaten religious expression ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BY3-GS31-JCBJ-Y4F4-00000-00&context=1519360), [Orlando Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BY8-TMV1-DY37-F42Y-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   A potential vulnerability is Luna's positioning on social media censorship and contentious legislation, which could attract criticism from both free speech advocates and those concerned about hate speech or misinformation ([South Florida Sun-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BYG-T8S1-DY37-F4H6-00000-00&context=1519360)).
