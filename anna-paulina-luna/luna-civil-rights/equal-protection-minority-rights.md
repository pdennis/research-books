# Positions on Equal Protection, Justice, and Minority Rights

### Summary

-   In October 2020, Anna Paulina Luna incorrectly claimed that over half of African Americans are incarcerated, a statement her campaign later clarified as referencing the high proportion of Black Americans among the incarcerated population (about 40%) [(Tampa Bay Times, 10/17/20)](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6139-7741-JCBJ-Y0NC-00000-00&context=1519360).

-   Luna has openly criticized the idea that investigations into Hunter Biden are racially motivated, disputing Democratic arguments about a racially biased "two-tiered" justice system during congressional hearings [(Free Press, 7/20/23)](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68RP-30H1-DXVP-T0BH-00000-00&context=1519360).

-   Luna supported potential impeachment of officials involved in alleged obstruction of the Hunter Biden investigation, framing the issue as one of accountability rather than partisanship [(Free Press, 7/20/23)](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68RP-30H1-DXVP-T0BH-00000-00&context=1519360).

-   In May 2024, Luna voted against the Antisemitism Awareness Act, which would change the federal definition of antisemitism in discrimination law, joining a small number of Republicans and Democrats in opposition [(Orlando Sentinel, 5/4/24)](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BY8-TMV1-DY37-F42Y-00000-00&context=1519360).

-   Potential vulnerability: Luna's repeated misstatement about African American incarceration rates could be seen as undermining her credibility on issues of minority rights and criminal justice [(Tampa Bay Times, 10/17/20)](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6139-7741-JCBJ-Y0NC-00000-00&context=1519360).

### Equal Justice and Rule of Law

#### Comments on DOJ handling of protests

**October 2020: Luna Incorrectly Claimed Over Half Of African Americans Are Incarcerated** According to Tampa Bay Times, "She also twice incorrectly stated that more than half the African American population nationwide is incarcerated. The claim led Devona Pierre, St. Petersburg College's director of equity, diversity and inclusion and the moderator of the discussion, to furrow her brow and ask Luna to clarify. 'Well there's a large percentage,' Luna said. 'I don't have the percentage offhand, but there's a large percentage. In fact, most of the people in the incarceration system are Black Americans.'" \[Tampa Bay Times, [10/17/20](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6139-7741-JCBJ-Y0NC-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**October 2020: Luna's Campaign Clarified Incarceration Statistics Statement** According to Tampa Bay Times, "After the forum, Luna's campaign spokesman, James Blair, said she misspoke. 'The point she meant was that nearly half (\~40%) of incarcerated population in America is black,' Blair said in a text message. 'Much higher share of prison population than actual population.'" \[Tampa Bay Times, [10/17/20](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6139-7741-JCBJ-Y0NC-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**July 2023: Luna Criticized Democrats For Invoking Race During Hunter Biden Hearing** According to Free Press, "Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida criticized Democrats Wednesday following the hearing on the Hunter Biden probe, saying they tried to make race an issue." \[Free Press (Tampa, Florida), [7/20/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68RP-30H1-DXVP-T0BH-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**July 2023: Luna Questioned Claims Of A Two-Tiered Justice System Based On Race In Biden Hearing** According to Free Press, 'They were saying Republicans are trying to make it about a two-tiered justice system of which we were robbing black and brown people of the acknowledgment that there is a two-tier justice system against black and brown people,' Luna said. 'So, I brought up the point during my questioning, that isn't it ironic that per their definition, Hunter Biden, a privileged white male who's being given special treatment by the Department of Justice, FBI, and the IRS, which they are going to bat for, is the exact same person we are trying to criminally investigate and they are saying that it's an issue about race.' \[Free Press (Tampa, Florida), [7/20/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68RP-30H1-DXVP-T0BH-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**May 2024: Luna Voted Against Antisemitism Awareness Act** According to Orlando Sentinel, "Republicans Anna Paulina Luna, Matt Gaetz and Byron Donalds and Democrat Maxwell Frost voted against it \[the bill that would change the definition of antisemitism in federal discrimination law\]." \[Orlando Sentinel (Florida), [5/4/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BY8-TMV1-DY37-F42Y-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2023: Anna Paulina Luna Called Double Standard In Justice System** "**Extremely Alarming**" In an interview with Fox Business, Anna Paulina Luna said, "It does show that there's a double standard that exists in the justice system. And that's something that, regardless of party affiliation, I will always continue to stand against." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with Fox Business, [3/21/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67V1-3MH1-JDPT-T0CR-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

#### Support for impeachment proceedings

**July 2023: Luna Supported Impeachment Of Individuals Obstructing Hunter Biden Investigation** According to Free Press, 'I could not agree further that there needs to be, I believe, impeachment of the individuals that are involved in regards to obstructing this investigation as well as the fact that Hunter Biden's plea deal is nothing more than a sweetheart deal, as you saw, this is not a partisan investigation,' Luna told Fox News. \[Free Press (Tampa, Florida), [7/20/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68RP-30H1-DXVP-T0BH-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
