### Women's Rights and Gender Issues

#### Criticism of gender policies and terminology

**2021: Anna Paulina Luna Described Sexism In Political Attacks Against Women** In an interview with Florida Politics, Anna Paulina Luna said, "I do think that women are attacked in ways that men aren't, and collectively the insider political class tries to make that OK. They just want lackeys that will play their insider political games and do their bidding. The insiders will say or do anything to stop people like me from being elected because they know they can't control me; they know they can't twist my arm, bully me or buy my vote." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with Florida Politics, [9/5/21](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/455163-a-tough-conversation-with-anna-paulina-luna/)\]

#### Advocacy for protection of women's sports

**2024: Anna Paulina Luna Asserted Commitment To** '**Fight For Women**' **And Criticized Gender Policies** In an interview with Fox Business, Anna Paulina Luna said, "I can actually define a woman, you know, while they're trying to erase motherhood, while they are trying to call mothers chest feeders, while they're trying to put literally men in women's sports, which, by the way, kudos to the Supreme Court for making the correct decision and protecting women's sports today. But while they're trying to do all that, they're going to then attack me for wearing a swimsuit. \[...\] but what I will tell you is that I will do everything to fight for women in this country, more than Kamala Harris." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with Fox Business, [8/16/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CRV-31J1-F15W-H3TK-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Parental Rights and Family Policy

#### Push for parent proxy voting in Congress

**April 2025: Luna Argued For Remote Voting To Accommodate Female Representatives And New Parents** According to CNN, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna stated, "That it's important to have family voices in Washington, but it's also equally important to ensure that female representatives are given a platform and that we can still vote. I mean, you can't help childbirth. It's a very natural thing." \[CNN THE SITUATION ROOM 11:30 AM EST, [4/2/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FGB-60D3-RRHD-K54F-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
