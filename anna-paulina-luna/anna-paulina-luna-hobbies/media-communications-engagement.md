### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna built a large and influential social media following, amassing over 830,000 followers by late 2022, and exceeding 1.3 million across platforms by mid-2023---more than any other GOP freshman in Congress ([Media Matters](https://www.mediamatters.org/spanish-language-media/between-congressional-bids-el-americans-anna-paulina-luna-has-been), [TIME](https://time.com/6292871/anna-paulina-luna-influencer-congress/)).

-   Luna strategically uses her social media presence to bypass traditional press, arguing that the reach of her online platforms allows her to "become the media" and communicate directly with constituents ([TIME](https://time.com/6292871/anna-paulina-luna-influencer-congress/)).

-   She has leveraged social media and online platforms to advocate for conservative policies and strengthen her political brand, which has played a significant role in her rise to prominence ([TheDPLG](https://www.thedplg.com/celebs-wild/gaze-upon-anna-paulina-lunas-captivating-feet.html)).

-   Luna has used her platforms to broadcast major events, such as live streaming press conferences on X (formerly Twitter), including those related to UAP (unidentified aerial phenomena) hearings ([NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69S7-BRC1-JBCN-31JG-00000-00&context=1519360), [Palm Beach Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69SF-MM31-DXGX-61KC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Some sources have noted Luna's use of her social media network to spread election misinformation, signaling a potential vulnerability in her media and public engagement strategy ([Media Matters](https://www.mediamatters.org/spanish-language-media/between-congressional-bids-el-americans-anna-paulina-luna-has-been)).
