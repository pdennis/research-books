#### Denouncing anti-female ideals in media

**2023: Luna Denounced The View Hosts For Promoting Ideals Contrary To Pro-Female Principles** According to Free Press (Tampa, Florida), "According to the Examiner, Luna denounced the liberal hosts of 'The View' for betraying pro-female ideals. 'They are supposed to pride themselves on being a channel that promotes women viewpoints, right? Yeah, if you are pro-life, they want to essentially promote someone that's calling for your murder,' Luna added." \[Free Press (Tampa, Florida), [3/15/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67ST-GKD1-JBCN-33X1-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
