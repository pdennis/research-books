# Personal Development in Youth

### Summary

-   Luna has described herself as half-White and half-Mexican, stating she does not feel compelled to favor either aspect of her heritage ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/08/anna-paulina-luna-congress-instagram-maga/), 11/8/22).

-   At age 29, she adopted the name Anna Paulina Luna, changing her last name in 2019 to honor her mother's family ([Stars and Stripes](https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2023-02-10/making-congresswoman-anna-paulina-luna-9100015.html), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:616X-X6P1-JCBJ-Y02V-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   In 2019, Luna moved from Washington State to St. Petersburg, Florida, just before launching her political career ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:616X-X6P1-JCBJ-Y02V-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Her reported ethnicity on voter registration forms changed: in 2015, Luna identified as "White, not of Hispanic Origin," but as "Hispanic" in 2019 ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67KX-D231-DYTM-N14V-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The shift in how Luna identified herself, both in name and ethnicity, could raise questions about consistency in her personal narrative.
