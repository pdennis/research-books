# Federal Spending and Fiscal Responsibility

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna strongly opposed the expansion of the IRS, supporting efforts in 2023 to repeal funding for 87,000 new IRS agents and describing taxation as "theft" ([Fox Business](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6795-9GK1-JBHT-D1W4-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna participated in House votes aiming to block additional IRS agents, pledging to continue the fight against such measures even as the Senate debated them ([Fox Business](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6795-9GK1-JBHT-D1W4-00000-00&context=1519360), [CAVUTO](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6790-41T1-JCP1-P06D-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna opposed a key House debt limit bill in May 2023, signaling a stance against major federal spending agreements ([Fox News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68C5-HBX1-F072-X247-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She has frequently criticized the Biden administration's handling of federal spending, economic transparency, and inflation, claiming a lack of openness about the country's fiscal situation ([Fox Business](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:689F-8391-JDPT-T0SV-00000-00&context=1519360), [Fox Business Network](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BWR-CCG1-F15W-H00H-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna's hardline rhetoric against federal taxation and spending may make it difficult to negotiate bipartisan fiscal solutions or support necessary government funding.
