# Technology and Data Privacy Protections

### Summary

-   Luna's aggressive push to ban TikTok and crack down on Chinese tech may alienate younger, tech-savvy voters and those wary of government overreach into technology and free expression ([Fox News, 3/23/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67VD-YMK1-JCS1-650P-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Her strong framing of TikTok as a "CCP information-gathering operation" could be criticized as alarmist, especially if evidence of specific harm is lacking ([Fox News, 3/23/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67VD-YMK1-JCS1-650P-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The focus on banning versus regulating big tech platforms may spark opposition from civil liberties groups and those concerned about digital rights and privacy protections.

-   Luna's personal avoidance of all social media apps may be seen as out of touch or impractical by constituents who rely on these platforms for business and personal connections ([Fox News, 3/23/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67VD-YMK1-JCS1-650P-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Claims of bipartisan support for drastic tech restrictions could be overestimated and risk backlash if Congressional attitudes shift or if tech and business lobbyists mobilize against such measures ([Fox News Channel, 3/23/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67VF-1VG1-JDPT-T126-00000-00&context=1519360)).
