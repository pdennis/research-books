# Legislative Initiatives Affecting Consumers

### Summary

-   In June 2024, U.S. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (FL-13) introduced the "Do or Dye Act" in Congress, seeking a nationwide ban on food additives including Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and related colorants ([USA TODAY/Ocala Star Banner](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D4B-FTP1-JB1V-G0W0-00000-00&context=1519360), [Palm Beach Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D4B-FTP1-JB1V-G120-00000-00&context=1519360), [Herald-Tribune (Florida)](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D4B-FTP1-JB1V-G1F9-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna underscored that these dyes are already banned in several foreign countries due to health concerns, using this as a key justification for the proposed U.S. legislation ([USA TODAY/Ocala Star Banner](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D4B-FTP1-JB1V-G0W0-00000-00&context=1519360), [Northwest Florida Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D4B-FPM1-JB1V-G4F2-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   The congresswoman aimed to incorporate similar provisions from the "Do or Dye Act" into amendments for the 2024 Farm Bill, which faces a Congressional deadline at the end of the month ([Ocala Star Banner](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D4B-FTP1-JB1V-G0W0-00000-00&context=1519360), [Stuart News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D4B-FTP1-JB1V-G1R4-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   If her legislation passes, Luna hopes food producers would be compelled to use healthier alternatives or eliminate artificial dyes altogether, resulting in cleaner and safer consumer products ([USA TODAY/Ocala Star Banner](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D4B-FTP1-JB1V-G0W0-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   A potential vulnerability is that the bill's scope and definitions---including what counts as "substantially similar" additives---may face legal and industry pushback, complicating implementation and compliance.
