### Criticism from Democrats and Other Political Opponents

**2023: DCCC Spokesperson Criticized Luna As Catering To Far-right Wing** According to Tampa Bay Times, '"Extreme MAGA Republican Anna Paulina Luna is a phony politician who wastes her time in Congress catering to the far-right wing instead of focusing on the problems Floridians care about,' said Justin Chermol, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee." \[Tampa Bay Times, [6/14/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68HM-RJG1-JCBJ-Y187-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2023: Letter Writer Jim Harper Criticized Anna Paulina Luna's Focus on UFO Investigations** According to a letter to the editor published in Tampa Bay Times, "The future of Social Security, health care, taxes, spending, climate, infrastructure investment and international security appears to be an insufficient focus for Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, elected to Congress last year from Pinellas County. No, she wants to investigate UFOs. According to the Tampa Bay Times, 'Luna pointed to a 2019 poll that found 68% of Americans believe the government knows more than it's saying about UFOs.' 'From my personal experience, I believe the same thing,' said Luna, who once posed for a campaign photo in full combat gear, brandishing an assault rifle and a big knife, and holding a mean-looking German shepherd on a leash." \[Letter to the Editor - Tampa Bay Times, [7/31/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68V7-J3N1-JCBJ-Y329-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2023: Letter Writer Carlos J. DeCisneros Criticized Anna Paulina Luna's Support for UFO Investigations** According to a letter to the editor published in Tampa Bay Times, "I wonder how many of Reps. Anna Paulina Luna's and Matt Gaetz' constituents said to themselves after they got their new higher homeowners insurance rates: 'I wish the government would investigate UFOs.' Is there any conspiracy they won't take advantage of?" \[Letter to the Editor - Tampa Bay Times, [7/31/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68V7-J3N1-JCBJ-Y329-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2024: Democratic Challenger Fox Called Anna Paulina Luna's Garland Actions Political Stunt** According to NBC - 8 WFLA, '"I think this is just another Anna Paulina's political theatrical stunts," said Whitney Fox, a Democrat running to unseat Luna.' \[NBC - 8 WFLA: Web Edition Articles (Florida), [6/27/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CBT-3CV1-JBCN-32PK-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2024: Anna Paulina Luna Attributed Threats To A Far Left Activist** In an interview with Fox News, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna said, "We don't know right now, but what I will say is that we have and what I would actually be comfortable at least saying on air is that it was from a very far left activist, at least from what I gather." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with Fox News YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO, [9/18/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0H-XVJ1-F072-X0YH-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2024: Anna Paulina Luna Criticized Opponents For Not Condemning Threats Against Her** In an interview with CQ Transcriptions, Anna Paulina Luna said, "even in my own -- and speaking to my own case and circumstance, I have actually not seen any of my opponents condemn what happened or even acknowledge that it happened." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with CQ Transcriptions, [9/18/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0N-50G1-JDPT-T1Y1-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Campaign Rivalries (e.g., Charlie Crist, Amanda Makki)

**2024: John Liccione Accused Anna Paulina Luna Of Russian Corruption** According to Tampa Bay Times, "He is the founder of RussiLeaks, 'a news media company whose sole focus is exposing Putin's secrets and those of his American operatives.' Among them, he says, is Luna, whom he sees as 'corrupted by Putin.'" \[Tampa Bay Times, [9/18/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:696M-4YB1-DYTM-N011-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

### Legal Disputes and Allegations

**September 2024: Anna Paulina Luna Attributed The Threat To Political Division And Hate Campaigns** According to NBC - 8 WFLA, "Luna blamed the incident on a 'division and hate campaign against Republicans,' but there is no official word from law enforcement on the nature of the threat, a suspect or their motive." \[NBC - 8 WFLA: Web Edition Articles (Florida), [9/18/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0P-MVT1-JBCN-32J5-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2024: Anna Paulina Luna Claimed Threat Originated From Far-Left Activist** In an interview with CQ Transcriptions, Anna Paulina Luna said, "it was from a very far left activist, at least from what I gather. And so I won't say too much more on that, but it is alarming that we're specifically seeing that people that are simply fighting for Americans that feel that they have been left behind or ignored by Washington, that we're becoming the targets." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with CQ Transcriptions, [9/18/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0N-50G1-JDPT-T1Y1-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
