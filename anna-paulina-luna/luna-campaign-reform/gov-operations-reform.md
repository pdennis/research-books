# Government Operations and Legislative Reform

### Summary

-   Deep internal GOP divisions surfaced over proxy voting for new parents, culminating in Anna Paulina Luna's resignation from the House Freedom Caucus and public accusations of betrayal and threats by fellow Republicans ([Florida Politics](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/729341-anna-paulina-luna-resigns-from-house-freedom-caucus-after-new-parent-proxy-vote-dustup/), [NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FG3-0G53-SB5T-S2N9-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   GOP leadership repeatedly blocked or opposed reforms such as remote or proxy voting for new parents, despite bipartisan and cross-aisle efforts, raising concerns about institutional resistance to modernization and family support ([Florida Politics](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/729341-anna-paulina-luna-resigns-from-house-freedom-caucus-after-new-parent-proxy-vote-dustup/), [WFIN Local News](https://wfin.com/fox-political-news/anna-paulina-luna-forces-house-leaderships-hand-on-proxy-voting-as-gop-war-escalates/)).

-   Public airing of GOP infighting---including accusations of smearing, bribery, and procedural sabotage---has damaged party unity and presents a risk of ongoing legislative gridlock ([NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FG3-0G53-SB5T-S2N9-00000-00&context=1519360), [Florida Politics](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/729341-anna-paulina-luna-resigns-from-house-freedom-caucus-after-new-parent-proxy-vote-dustup/)).

-   Disputes over House rules (such as the Motion to Vacate and floor voting procedures) have left leadership vulnerable to internal revolts and criticism for both over-centralization and lack of empowerment for rank-and-file members ([CNN](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BV1-KWD1-F15W-H01J-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Legislative process frustrations are mounting, with Luna and others denouncing major bills for being "irresponsibly rushed," indicating a broader problem of perceived procedural unfairness and weak consensus-building ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BY3-GS31-JCBJ-Y4F4-00000-00&context=1519360), [South Florida Sun-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BYG-T8S1-DY37-F4H6-00000-00&context=1519360)).
