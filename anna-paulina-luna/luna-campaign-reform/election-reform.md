# Elections, Voting, and Campaign Reform

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna has vocally supported claims of a "stolen" 2020 presidential election but has not provided evidence to substantiate these claims ([Al Dia News](https://aldianews.com/en/politics/women-politics/who-anna-paulina-luna)).

-   Luna is a prominent advocate for tightening election security, championing the SAVE Act to require proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections, and repeatedly urged House leadership to attach such provisions to funding bills ([Fox News, Sept 2024](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CXH-F601-F15W-H2HP-00000-00&context=1519360); [CQ Transcriptions](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0N-50G1-JDPT-T1Y1-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She has consistently supported in-person voting with voter ID, expressed concerns about voter suppression, and placed faith in a revamped RNC ballot operation for 2024 ([Sunday Morning Futures](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBJ-SRM1-JBHT-D0BP-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   In 2025, Luna led a bipartisan discharge petition to allow new parents in Congress to vote remotely by proxy and reached a compromise with House Speaker Mike Johnson to formalize "vote pairing," increasing flexibility for lawmakers during parental leave ([NBC - 8 WFLA, April 2025](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FGF-M4W3-RT2G-7184-00000-00&context=1519360); [Daytona Beach News-Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FHK-3H13-RX4F-C007-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Her efforts on proxy voting have drawn bipartisan support but also faced GOP leadership resistance, ultimately resulting in a compromise rather than a full adoption of proxy voting ([NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FHY-DF73-S34K-14VP-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna's strong stances on election security and voting reform have occasionally raised questions regarding evidence for her claims and the constitutional feasibility of some proposals, exposing potential vulnerabilities and partisan friction (see [Al Dia News](https://aldianews.com/en/politics/women-politics/who-anna-paulina-luna); [South Florida Sun-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B4X-1X41-JBM5-R013-00000-00&context=1519360)).
