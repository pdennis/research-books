# Positions on Family Planning and Women's Health

### Summary

-   Luna has been accused by the DCCC of supporting an "anti-IVF budget" while introducing legislation seen as a superficial attempt to cover up her record, raising questions about consistency and sincerity on IVF access ([DCCC Press Release](https://dccc.org/anna-paulina-lunas-new-budget-cut-social-security-and-medicare-and-ban-ivf/)).

-   Her "Right to Try IVF Act" has been criticized as being too narrow and ineffective, potentially failing to offer broad protection for IVF and risking loss of federal grants for states that ban IVF ([Palm Beach Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BRH-SHN1-JB1V-G142-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna's statements in favor of states protecting IVF could conflict with her strong anti-abortion stance, suggesting possible inconsistencies in her positions on reproductive health issues ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BF7-JHJ1-JCBJ-Y49P-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She faces criticism for her rejection of Planned Parenthood and her approach to women's health, which some see as alienating to diverse groups of women and dismissive of broader reproductive rights concerns ([Fox News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DN1-T0C1-JCS1-62CX-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Opponents argue her public messaging and legislative actions on family planning and women's health are politically motivated, undermining trust among moderate and pro-choice voters.

**2024: DCCC Claimed Luna's Budget as Anti-IVF and a Cover-Up Attempt** According to a press release from the DCCC, "Her anti-IVF budget further exposes Luna's cynical ploy to cover up her anti-IVF record by introducing a pointless IVF bill." \[Press Release - DCCC, [3/21/24](https://dccc.org/anna-paulina-lunas-new-budget-cut-social-security-and-medicare-and-ban-ivf/)\]

**2024: Anna Paulina Luna Called For States To Protect In Vitro Fertilization** According to Tampa Bay Times, '"IVF, when conducted responsibly, is a solution for those who are not able to naturally conceive. Having a family should be something people of all backgrounds can rally behind," said U.S. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, who represents parts of Pinellas County and is an outspoken abortion opponent. "States must take action to protect IVF to ensure families are able to bring new life into this world."' \[Tampa Bay Times, [2/27/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BF7-JHJ1-JCBJ-Y49P-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2024: Anna Paulina Luna Introduced Right To Try IVF Act Amid IVF Access Debates** According to Palm Beach Post (Florida), "She is the only Republican in the House of Representatives with legislation on IVF. That bill, the Right to Try IVF Act of 2024, has been criticized by Democrats as too narrow to be effective. The legislation would disqualify states that ban in vitro fertilization from receiving a federal block grant for mothers and children." \[Palm Beach Post (Florida), [4/7/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BRH-SHN1-JB1V-G142-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**December 2024: Luna Criticized Planned Parenthood And Rejected Identity Politics** According to Fox News, "Look, Planned Parenthood, people like myself, people like Amber Rose, that don't fit their narrative and what they expect women to be, which is basically, you know, male hating, pro-abortion, flag waving, you know, A through Z, LGBTQ or whatever." \[Fox News INGRAHAM ANGLE 7:00 PM EST, [12/13/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DN1-T0C1-JCS1-62CX-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
