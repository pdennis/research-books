# Abortion Stance and Legislative Actions

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna is a self-described "pro-life extremist," publicly supporting strict abortion bans including those with no exceptions for rape or incest, and backing laws such as Texas' six-week abortion ban ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66M0-2CX1-JCBJ-Y32B-00000-00&context=1519360), [Palm Beach Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BRH-SHN1-JB1V-G142-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She celebrated the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade and has consistently advocated for the pro-life movement, describing abortion as an issue of protecting the unborn ([Al Dia News](https://aldianews.com/en/politics/women-politics/who-anna-paulina-luna)).

-   Luna strongly supports Florida's near-total abortion ban and praised the state's six-week limit as "following the science" regarding fetal heartbeat detection ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BRS-77D1-DYTM-N00D-00000-00&context=1519360), [Palm Beach Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BRH-SHN1-JB1V-G142-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   While personally pro-life, Luna increasingly frames abortion as a states' rights issue, repeatedly saying these decisions should be made at the local level and that her federal role limits her influence over state policy ([Fox Business](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5B16-KY61-JCRM-B090-00000-00&context=1519360), [NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CYT-FCF1-JBCN-340P-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna's legislative record and public comments have drawn criticism and political attacks for being out of step with constituents, especially regarding her opposition to abortion exceptions and support for measures that could restrict IVF, making abortion a potential vulnerability in her swing district ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BRS-77D1-DYTM-N00D-00000-00&context=1519360), [Press Release - DCCC](https://dccc.org/anna-paulina-lunas-new-budget-cut-social-security-and-medicare-and-ban-ivf/)).
