# Federal Spending and Budgetary Priorities

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna has consistently opposed large federal spending bills she considers wasteful, often citing concerns about "pork" and unnecessary expenditures, including her vocal opposition to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and various continuing resolutions (CRs) ([FOX 13](https://www.fox13news.com/news/one-on-one-with-anna-paulina-luna-her-views-on-banning-oil-exports-pork-infrastructure-spending-vaccines), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:698T-TWH1-JCBJ-Y1X0-00000-00&context=1519360), [Fox News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DP5-W013-RRVY-J3RF-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She supports using legislative tools such as rescissions to claw back unspent federal funds and has prioritized reducing national debt, government waste, and inflation, while promising to protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts ([Fox News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DSH-55B3-RS1F-G0W7-00000-00&context=1519360), [Fox Business](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6793-9DB1-JDPT-T322-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna has advocated for strict adherence to budgetary review rules, such as the 72-hour rule before voting on spending bills, and has called out colleagues---even within her own party---for enabling excessive spending and dysfunction in Congress ([Fox Business](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BN4-M2D1-DY0W-40TM-00000-00&context=1519360), [CAVUTO](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BMS-VCM1-F072-X001-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She has publicly supported using the threat of, or actual, government shutdowns as leverage to force spending reforms, insisting essential payments like Social Security and Medicare remain unaffected ([Fox Business](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6793-9DB1-JDPT-T322-00000-00&context=1519360), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:698T-TWH1-JCBJ-Y1X0-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Vulnerability: Luna's staunch opposition to compromise bills has triggered criticism from Democrats who allege that her votes risk stripping health care access and food assistance from vulnerable families, and she has faced attacks for voting against budget bills that included disaster relief ([DCCC](https://dccc.org/anna-paulina-luna-votes-to-rip-away-health-care-access-and-take-food-off-of-floridians-tables/), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBR-K961-F03F-K492-00000-00&context=1519360)).

They had a bill that they proposed for veterans, but there was unnecessary spending that did not go to vets. And I don't agree with that." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with FOX 13, [8/12/22](https://www.fox13news.com/news/one-on-one-with-anna-paulina-luna-her-views-on-banning-oil-exports-pork-infrastructure-spending-vaccines)\]
