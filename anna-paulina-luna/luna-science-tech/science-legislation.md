# Legislation and Oversight on Science Issues

### Summary

-   Federal officials have allegedly withheld classified UFO/UAP documents from Congress, signaling a lack of transparency and potential executive-legislative branch conflict ([Miami Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69S5-HK11-DYJM-M01Y-00000-00&context=1519360)).

### Transparency in Government Science Records (e.g., JFK Files)

**November 2023: Luna Claimed Federal Officials Withheld Classified UFO Documents From Congress** According to Miami Herald, "During a Thursday news conference, Luna said federal officials have refused to allow them to see classified documents on UFOs, also known as unidentified aerial phenomena, despite whistleblowers coming forward with information claiming that the government has recovered such objects. 'It has become very clear and evident that there is an apparent attempt -- an orchestrated attempt -- to deny us this access,' Luna said." \[Miami Herald, [11/30/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69S5-HK11-DYJM-M01Y-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**November 2023: Luna Urged Passage Of Amendment To Declassify UFO Records** According to Miami Herald, "Luna and fellow Florida Reps. Matt Gaetz, a Republican, and Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat, urged congressional colleagues to pass an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act to require the Department of Defense to automatically declassify records relating to 'publicly known sightings.'" \[Miami Herald, [11/30/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69S5-HK11-DYJM-M01Y-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**July 2023: Luna Sought Classified Briefing On UFO Incident Near Elgin Air Force Base** According to Miami Herald, "Gaetz said Thursday that when he, Luna and Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tennessee, sought a classified briefing on a reported UFO incident near Elgin Air Force Base, near Pensacola, they were initially denied. After hours of negotiation, they were eventually able to meet with a test pilot who saw and photographed the object." \[Miami Herald, [11/30/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69S5-HK11-DYJM-M01Y-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
