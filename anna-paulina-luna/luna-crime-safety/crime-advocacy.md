# Legislation and Advocacy on Crime and Public Safety

### Summary

-   Inconsistency on Leniency: Luna advocated for maximum penalties and increased mandatory minimums for politically motivated and violent crimes, yet previously requested leniency for a Jan. 6 participant (Jeremy Michael Brown), suggesting potential double standards ([Tampa Bay Times, 3/29/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67WR-66W1-JCBJ-Y2HT-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Reliance on Unsubstantiated Claims: Luna frequently alleged coordinated violence via the "dark web" and connections between protests and terrorist groups, but often did so without providing direct evidence, opening vulnerability to criticism for amplifying conspiracy theories ([Fox News interviews 3/20/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FCS-M4W3-S5N3-C0KW-00000-00&context=1519360), [5/2/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BY7-5NX1-JDPT-T18V-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Targeting of Political Opponents and Protesters: Luna supported aggressive federal action and criminal referrals against sanctuary city mayors and left-leaning protest groups, raising questions around selective enforcement or politicization of public safety ([Fox News, 4/21/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMP-VSG3-RRVV-80CK-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Security Failures and Oversight: While Luna criticized law enforcement and Secret Service lapses---especially after the Trump rally shooting---her calls for immediate firings and reforms raise questions about due process and the effectiveness of legislative oversight ([CQ Transcriptions, 7/23/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CJP-SP41-F15W-H3TY-00000-00&context=1519360), [Fox Business, 7/23/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CJG-TF61-F15W-H374-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Focus on High-Profile Punitive Measures: Luna's push for the death penalty and harsher federal penalties for child sex offenders, while aligning with public safety concerns, has drawn criticism for prioritizing punitive over preventive or rehabilitative approaches ([The Free Press, 4/11/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BSM-94X1-DXVP-T0S9-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Perception of Politicized Law Enforcement Support: Luna's strong backing of "Back the Blue" and condemnation of protest-related violence is seen by opponents as selectively applied, especially when coupled with criticism of federal law enforcement in right-wing contexts ([Fox Business, 3/21/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67V1-3MH1-JDPT-T0CR-00000-00&context=1519360), [Fox News, 11/16/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69ND-7C81-JDPT-T509-00000-00&context=1519360)).

I think that that security measure needs to be changed immediately. But it's also very frustrating that this is not the first time that this has happened at the White House, and yet, they chose not to implement better measures in order to avoid this.
