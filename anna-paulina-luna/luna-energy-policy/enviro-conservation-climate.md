# Environmental Conservation and Climate Change

### Summary

-   Luna's opposition to the Army Corps' perpetual easement policy could be seen as prioritizing property rights over broader environmental and public access interests, risking criticism from conservation and public land advocates ([Tampa Bay Times, April 2023](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6814-R3H1-DYTM-N2DC-00000-00&context=1519360); [Tampa Bay Times, June 2024](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C6B-H7M1-DYTM-N00J-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   By strongly opposing the Democratic Party's climate agenda and linking green initiatives to enabling China, Luna risks appearing dismissive of mainstream climate science and global cooperation efforts ([Tampa Bay Times, June 2024](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C6B-H7M1-DYTM-N00J-00000-00&context=1519360); [Sunday Morning Futures, June 2023](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68D3-R9P1-DY0W-42F8-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Her selective emphasis on local environmental issues, such as beach renourishment, while opposing broader climate action could be viewed as inconsistent or lacking a comprehensive environmental policy ([Tampa Bay Times, April 2023](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6814-R3H1-DYTM-N2DC-00000-00&context=1519360); [Tampa Bay Times, June 2024](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C6B-H7M1-DYTM-N00J-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna's alignment with predecessor Charlie Crist on the easement dispute blurs partisan lines, potentially confusing her political identity among core Republican voters ([Tampa Bay Times, April 2023](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6814-R3H1-DYTM-N2DC-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Although she identifies as a conservationist, her public remarks could be perceived as at odds with common conservation policies supported by both environmental groups and some constituents ([Sunday Morning Futures, June 2023](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68D3-R9P1-DY0W-42F8-00000-00&context=1519360)).

### Conservation Policy and Local Efforts

#### Support for local conservation projects

**April 2023: Anna Paulina Luna Criticized Federal Handling Of Pinellas Beach Renourishment Project** According to Tampa Bay Times, "U.S. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna is not happy with how the federal government is handling a pivotal Pinellas County beach renourishment project. The Republican, along with nine other local elected officials, wrote a letter Thursday pressing officials on a controversial federal requirement that's held up the project for months - and caused disputes between neighbors along Pinellas' Gulf coast." \[Tampa Bay Times, [4/13/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6814-R3H1-DYTM-N2DC-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**April 2023: Luna Opposed Army Corps' Perpetual Easement Requirement For Renourishment** According to Tampa Bay Times, "This is an ill-intentioned attempt by the Army Corps and the federal government to strip property rights from homeowners,' Luna's letter reads." \[Tampa Bay Times, [4/13/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6814-R3H1-DYTM-N2DC-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**April 2023: Luna Warned Of Environmental And Economic Impact If Renourishment Did Not Proceed** According to Tampa Bay Times, '"Without renourishment, Pinellas County will be more prone to flood damages, which will negatively impact the local economy,' Luna's letter reads. 'The beach will dissipate and erode, demolishing many habitats to endangered species and threatened wildlife.'" \[Tampa Bay Times, [4/13/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6814-R3H1-DYTM-N2DC-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2023: Luna And Other Officials Requested A Meeting With Army Corps Representatives** According to Tampa Bay Times, "In Luna's letter, officials questioned the need for the easements given that the Army Corps didn't require them for past renourishments. They also requested a meeting with representatives from the Army." \[Tampa Bay Times, [4/13/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6814-R3H1-DYTM-N2DC-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2023: Luna Aligned With Predecessor Charlie Crist On Beach Renourishment Issue** According to Tampa Bay Times, "Opposing the easements is one of the few issues with which Luna appears to agree with Democrat Charlie Crist, Luna's predecessor in Florida's 13th Congressional District. Last year, Crist wrote his own letter to the federal government calling the easement requirement 'impossible' and 'arbitrary.'" \[Tampa Bay Times, [4/13/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6814-R3H1-DYTM-N2DC-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2023: Anna Paulina Luna Criticized Colleagues For Supporting Green Movement She Believed Enabled China** In an interview with Sunday Morning Futures, Anna Paulina Luna said, "A lot of my colleagues, they seem to be, I don't want to say brainwashed, but they seem to be so far fixated on this green movement, what they don't realize is, the green movement and the idea behind it is doing nothing but enabling China." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with Sunday Morning Futures, [6/4/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68D3-R9P1-DY0W-42F8-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2023: Anna Paulina Luna Identified As Conservationist Who Supported Environmental Protection** In an interview with Sunday Morning Futures, Anna Paulina Luna said, "I'm the first person to say I care about the environment. I consider myself a conservationist." \[Interview - Anna Paulina Luna with Sunday Morning Futures, [6/4/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68D3-R9P1-DY0W-42F8-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**2024: Anna Paulina Luna Opposed Army Corps' Beach Renourishment Easement Policy** According to Tampa Bay Times, "Luna opposes the federal government's stance. \[...\] For years, there's been a standoff between Pinellas beach communities and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The feds say they won't add sand to eroding public beaches unless nearby property owners sign perpetual easements allowing public access to their land. Many landowners are refusing, meaning beaches in need of sand are slowly washing away. Luna opposes the federal government's stance." \[Tampa Bay Times, [6/4/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C6B-H7M1-DYTM-N00J-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
