# Renewable Energy and Technological Innovation

### Summary

-   Potential backlash from local communities and tourism industry over the aesthetic and environmental impacts of offshore wind turbines, as reflected in concerns about harming Florida's "pristine beaches" and tourism ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:687R-Y5R1-JCBJ-Y36Y-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Broad Republican opposition to offshore wind projects near Florida's coasts may limit bipartisan cooperation and stall renewable energy development initiatives ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:687R-Y5R1-JCBJ-Y36Y-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Calls for additional federal studies and regulatory hurdles could be used as a delay tactic, potentially slowing progress on wind energy implementation ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:687R-Y5R1-JCBJ-Y36Y-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Framing of wind turbines as "ugly and ineffective" risks shaping public opinion against renewable projects, discouraging future technological investments ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:687R-Y5R1-JCBJ-Y36Y-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Disconnect between national renewable energy goals and state-level political resistance, undermining coordinated strategies for technological innovation and energy transition ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:687R-Y5R1-JCBJ-Y36Y-00000-00&context=1519360))

### Government Incentives for Renewables

#### Perspective on federal R&D funding

**May 2023: Luna Requested Federal Study On Offshore Wind Turbine Risks** According to Tampa Bay Times, "Luna, along with every member of the Florida Republican delegation, signed onto a letter sent Friday to the comptroller general of the U.S. Government Accountability Office requesting a sweeping study into the effects of the turbines in the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic Ocean on military readiness, endangered species, tourism and fishing - among other areas." \[Tampa Bay Times, [5/11/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:687R-Y5R1-JCBJ-Y36Y-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**May 2023: Luna Stated Republican Opposition To Offshore Turbines Near Florida** According to Tampa Bay Times, "The letter requesting the study is part of the Republican delegation's effort to halt any potential turbine construction off of Florida's coasts, Luna wrote in an emailed statement. 'It goes without saying that these ugly and ineffective turbines ... pose untold dangers to our state's coastal communities,' said Luna, a first-term member of Congress from St. Petersburg. 'People travel from around the world to see our pristine beaches - not windmills. My Florida Republican colleagues and I are committed to ensuring that no turbines are placed off Florida's coasts, and we look forward to seeing this study's conclusive support for protecting our home from wind development.'" \[Tampa Bay Times, [5/11/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:687R-Y5R1-JCBJ-Y36Y-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**Early 2023: Luna Sponsored Amendment To Delay Offshore Wind Construction** According to Tampa Bay Times, "The correspondence follows a move earlier this year from Luna to slow down wind turbine construction in the Gulf of Mexico. She sponsored an amendment that would have prevented any new turbines from being built until the comptroller general published a report on the effects of the turbines. That amendment passed and was attached to the Lower Energy Costs Act, a sweeping Republican-led energy bill, which cleared the House in March." \[Tampa Bay Times, [5/11/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:687R-Y5R1-JCBJ-Y36Y-00000-00&context=1519360)\]

**May 2023: Luna's Efforts Aimed To Secure Study Regardless Of Legislation Outcome** According to Tampa Bay Times, "But Luna's letter will help ensure the study gets done, law or no law, Luna spokesperson Edie Heipel said, noting Arkansas U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman, the chairperson of the House Committee on Natural Resources, also signed it. 'She made a promise on the amendment, and she's securing it ... with this letter,' Heipel wrote in a text message." \[Tampa Bay Times, [5/11/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:687R-Y5R1-JCBJ-Y36Y-00000-00&context=1519360)\]
