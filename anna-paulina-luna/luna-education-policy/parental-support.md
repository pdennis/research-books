# Support for Parental Involvement and School Choice

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna led efforts in Congress to allow new parents, particularly new mothers, to vote by proxy while recovering from childbirth, drafting both solo and bipartisan proposals to formalize parental leave proxy voting ([Orlando Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FJW-JXD3-RSRJ-43PS-00000-00&context=1519360); [NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FGG-XV53-S04K-T1K0-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna's proxy voting proposals gained bipartisan support, including from Democratic Representatives Brittany Pettersen and Sara Jacobs, leading to plans for up to 12 weeks of proxy voting for all new parents ([South Florida Sun-Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FG9-3NH3-RRW1-R1DW-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Facing resistance from GOP leadership, Luna used a discharge petition and led a group of Republicans who voted with Democrats to block leadership attempts to halt the proxy voting resolution, temporarily paralyzing the House ([NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FGP-X1V3-RSTP-X522-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   After negotiations, Luna agreed to abandon strict proxy voting in favor of formalizing the "live/dead pairing" practice, allowing absent members---including new parents---to have their votes paired and counted in certain circumstances ([St. Lucie News-Tribune](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FHK-3H13-RX4F-C11G-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna received bipartisan criticism for abandoning the initial comprehensive bipartisan effort for proxy voting, with some Democrats expressing disappointment in her shift ([NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FHY-DF73-S34K-14WY-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Separately, Luna has long advocated for school choice as a means to address racial inequality, citing her own experiences in multiple schools growing up ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6139-7741-JCBJ-Y0NC-00000-00&context=1519360)).
