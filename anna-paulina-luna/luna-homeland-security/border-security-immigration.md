# Border Security and Immigration Policy

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration's border and immigration policies, claiming they have intentionally weakened border security for political reasons and allowed known terrorists into the U.S. ([Fox News, 5/24/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C47-9T21-DY0W-451S-00000-00&context=1519360); [Fox Business, 6/4/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C65-3361-DY0W-4074-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Luna argues that the House has passed strong border security measures, including H.R.2, but accuses the Democrat-controlled Senate of blocking them and demanding mass amnesty in return ([Fox News, 5/24/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C47-9T21-DY0W-451S-00000-00&context=1519360); [Fox Business, 6/4/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C65-3361-DY0W-4074-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   She has claimed that the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. exceeds 22 million, that individuals on terrorist watchlists have entered via the border, and called for an immediate border shutdown ([Fox News, 5/24/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C47-9T21-DY0W-451S-00000-00&context=1519360); [Fox Business, 6/4/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C65-3361-DY0W-4074-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Luna asserts that Democrats label minorities who support border security as "racist" or "xenophobic," and claims that Biden's approach is political pandering that is pushing some traditional Democratic voters toward the GOP ([Fox Business, 6/4/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C65-3361-DY0W-4074-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Luna has condemned colleagues advocating to defund Border Patrol and ICE, arguing that such actions enable human traffickers and harm minority children ([Fox News, 2/7/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67H3-H811-F072-X3NY-00000-00&context=1519360))

-   Potential vulnerability: Some claims---such as the estimate of over 22 million illegal immigrants and allegations linking protest rhetoric directly to terrorist organizations---are contested or lack detailed public substantiation, which could open Luna's stance to criticism or fact-checking ([Fox News, INGRAHAM ANGLE 7:00 PM EST, 5/2/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BY1-V0C1-JCS1-62V8-00000-00&context=1519360))
