# Congressional Career and Legislative Actions

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna became the first Mexican-American woman elected to Congress from Florida by flipping the 13th Congressional District red in 2022, where she has since been known for her strong conservative stance and alignment with the House Freedom Caucus ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/02/10/anna-paulina-luna-republican-biography/), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68X5-8R81-JCBJ-Y46C-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna quickly gained attention for her role in high-profile House leadership battles, including initially opposing Kevin McCarthy's speakership and later participating in internal GOP debates about House rules and governance ([CNN](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6781-X7G1-JCP1-P48B-00000-00&context=1519360), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67KX-D231-DYTM-N14V-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She has sponsored a large number of legislative proposals---43 in her first term, two of which became law---including bipartisan measures such as the 'No Toxic Chemicals in Cosmetics Act' and bills on military sexual assault prevention and proxy voting for new parents ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBR-K961-F03F-K42D-00000-00&context=1519360), [Florida Politics](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/673933-americans-are-being-poisoned-anna-paulina-luna-files-no-toxic-chemicals-in-cosmetics-act/), [USA TODAY](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FDT-GD43-S63R-04JT-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna frequently advances local Pinellas County issues, including pressuring the Army Corps on beach renourishment and advocating for veterans, but has faced criticism for securing less federal funding for her district than other Florida first-termers ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBR-K961-F03F-K42D-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Her push to allow proxy voting for new parents after giving birth led to a bipartisan House debate, GOP leadership conflict, and a procedural compromise around vote pairing; this advocacy signaled her willingness to break with her party for family-related reforms ([NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FG7-MYX3-RTH3-S19R-00000-00&context=1519360), [Orlando Sentinel](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FJV-PM23-RYYD-33WB-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Potential vulnerabilities have been noted, including constituent criticism for controversial votes prior to major hurricanes and for bringing less federal project funding to her district compared to her peers ([NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DB3-BXT1-DXVP-T29T-00000-00&context=1519360), [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBR-K961-F03F-K42D-00000-00&context=1519360)).
