# Political Positions, Media Engagement, and Oversight Activities

### Summary

-   Luna has a pattern of aggressive, sometimes controversial oversight efforts that often fail, such as repeated but unsuccessful attempts to hold Attorney General Garland in contempt of Congress ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBR-K961-F03F-K42D-00000-00&context=1519360), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/01/anna-paulina-luna-whitney-fox/)).

-   She frequently promotes or aligns with conspiracy theories, including questioning the single-bullet theory in the JFK assassination, alleging government cover-ups of events like COVID-19 origins, UFOs, 9/11, and Epstein files ([SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/entertainment/article/3298690/meet-glamorous-republican-congresswoman-anna-paulina-luna-donald-trump-has-tasked-former-maxim-model), [Florida Politics](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/720618-anna-paulina-luna-to-lead-task-force-on-government-secrets-from-jfk-shooting-to-jeffrey-epsteins-network/)).

-   Luna uses combative rhetoric and methods, at times mobilizing social media backlash and public shaming against colleagues, leading to internal Republican tensions and being described as a "performance artist" by critics ([voteannapaulina.com](https://www.voteannapaulina.com/post/the-influencer-who-came-to-congress), [TIME](https://time.com/6292871/anna-paulina-luna-influencer-congress/)).

-   Her advocacy for extreme disciplinary measures---such as repeated censure attempts, calls to fine or jail officials, and efforts to publicly expose or discipline political opponents---have often been blocked or watered down by her own party ([NBC - 8 WFLA](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68HV-JS81-JBCN-324M-00000-00&context=1519360), [The Free Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CXY-JVS1-DXVP-T21R-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She has made broad and sometimes unsubstantiated claims about corruption, mental fitness, and criminal behavior of high-level officials, which risk being seen as hyperbolic or lacking evidence ([Fox News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CCC-H831-JDPT-T012-00000-00&context=1519360), [FBN, Mornings with Maria](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CC9-06F1-JBHT-D2R8-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Controversial public statements on social media and in interviews have brought negative media attention and episodes of platform restrictions or censorship, complicating her relationship with both mainstream media and big tech ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:612N-9R31-JCBJ-Y01T-00000-00&context=1519360)).
