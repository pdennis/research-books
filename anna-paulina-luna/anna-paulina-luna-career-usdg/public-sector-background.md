# Early Involvement and Background in Public Sector

### Summary

-   Anna Paulina Luna is a U.S. Air Force veteran who began her public sector involvement as National Director of Hispanic Engagement for Turning Point USA in 2018, later chairing Hispanic Initiatives at PragerU ([Al Dia News](https://aldianews.com/en/politics/women-politics/who-anna-paulina-luna); [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6781-SHR1-DYTM-N4BG-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   She first ran for Congress in 2019, energizing her campaign with conservative activism, a strong social media presence, and a focus on issues affecting veterans ([Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/news/latina-veteran-launches-gop-congressional-bid-ryan-saavedra); [Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:616X-X6P1-JCBJ-Y02V-00000-00&context=1519360)).

-   Luna's personal background---involving childhood poverty and reliance on welfare---influences her conservative principles and messaging, particularly on cycles of dependency and the importance of military service ([Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/news/latina-veteran-launches-gop-congressional-bid-ryan-saavedra)).

-   She gained recognition as a media personality and advocate for Hispanic and veterans' issues, working with organizations such as Force Blue and chairing border security events ([Tampa Bay Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6164-TPD1-DYTM-N14J-00000-00&context=1519360); [Media Matters](https://www.mediamatters.org/congress/florida-gop-congressional-candidate-anna-paulina-luna-appeared-qanon-program-and-praised)).

-   A potential vulnerability stems from criticism regarding her portrayal of her military service, specifically questions about combat deployment and the use of military imagery in campaign materials ([Central Florida Post](https://centralfloridapost.com/2022/05/11/anna-paulina-luna-has-decades-long-history-of-abusing-court-issued-protective-orders/)).
