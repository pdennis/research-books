# Jeff Van Drew’s Policies Have Harmed Everyday People
- [:shopping_cart: *Backed Tariffs That Raise Prices For Families*](/jeff-van-drew/cost-of-living-tariffs) He defended broad “reciprocal” tariffs that economists and CBO say boost inflation and household costs.
- [:bank: *Backed Social Security Cuts And A Higher Retirement Age*](/jeff-van-drew/social-security-cuts-retirement-age) He helped advance a House bill cutting SSA’s budget by $250 million despite long wait times, is aligned with plans to raise the full retirement age to 69 (about a 13% cut for future retirees), and backs a “fiscal commission” push that would fast-track major changes AARP warns could mean drastic cuts.
- [:woman: *Backed Abortion Restrictions That Eliminate Access for Millions of Women*](/jeff-van-drew/abortion-access-restrictions) Van Drew cosponsored anti-abortion bills and voted against protecting abortion travel and contraception, while supporting “state-level” bans that have left millions without in-state access to care.
- [:no_entry_sign: *Cast A Deciding Vote To Cut Medicaid And Push Millions Off Coverage*](/jeff-van-drew/medicaid-work-requirements) His “yea” on a one-vote-margin bill wrote strict Medicaid work rules and other cuts into law that CBO says will cause large coverage losses.
- [:hospital: *Voted Against Medicare Drug Reforms That Lower Costs For Seniors*](/jeff-van-drew/medicare-drug-cost-caps-opposed) He opposed the IRA’s drug-price negotiation and $2,000 out-of-pocket cap, voted against a $35 insulin limit, and flipped from backing negotiation in 2019—siding with pharma over seniors.
