<h2><strong>King Was An Anti-Abortion Extremist</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>King Defended Texas’ Extreme Abortion Law</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Texas’ Law Banned Abortions If “A Detectable Fetal Heartbeat” Was Present And Contained No Exceptions For Rape Nor Incest. </strong>According to the Wall Street Journal, “The law, known as the Texas Heartbeat Act, or SB 8, says physicians can’t knowingly perform an abortion if there is ‘a detectable fetal heartbeat,’ which it defines as including cardiac activity in the embryo that appears after about six weeks into a pregnancy. The law, which contains no exceptions for rape or incest, has proved difficult to challenge in court because state officials have no direct role in enforcing it. Instead, the law delegates enforcement to private parties and authorizes civil damages of $10,000 or more to anyone who successfully sues a defendant accused of performing or aiding in such an abortion.” [Wall Street Journal, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/justice-department-to-ask-supreme-court-to-block-texas-abortion-law-11634321002?mod=djem10point"><u>10/15/21</u></a>]</p>
