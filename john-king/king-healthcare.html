<h3><strong>King Backed Georgia’s Affordable Care Act Marketplace, Georgia Access, Despite Technical Issues And Barriers To Care</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>King Wanted The Affordable Care Act Taken “Out Of Washington” To Expand Access To Affordable Health Care In Georgia</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] King Proposed “Bringing A Marketplace To Georgia” To “Make Sure That Every Georgian Has Access To Affordable Health Care Coverage.”</strong> “Meanwhile, we'll tackle on some big challenges redoing our state, getting out of the Affordable Care Act out of Washington, and bringing a marketplace to Georgia that we run to make sure that we every Georgian, has access to affordable health care coverage and also started tackling the abuses in our civil justice forums.” [Regulatory Oversight Podcast, 1/8/25]</p>
<h4><strong><u>King Lauded The Success Of Georgia’s New Private Insurance Marketplace, Georgia Access</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] King Touted The Success Of His Georgia Access Program And Claimed That It Out-Performed The Federal Government.</strong> “I'm incredibly proud of our work has been our team has accomplished this year, especially the closing and opening of health, open enrollment. We travel from, across the state, informing Georgians about the resources available through our office in Georgia Access. As a result, we signed to more than 1.5 million Georgians, signed up with private health insurance coverage, breaking all records across the nation and even outperforming the federal government. Why? Because small business owners across the state, especially the Latino encouraging folks looking into the facts that affordability of private health insurance coverage afforded Georgia Access and incredibly proud of. It is something that all need to celebrate.” [GHCC Legislative Breakfast, 2/20/25]</p>
<p><strong>King Was “Extremely Proud Of The Resounding Success Of This Year’s Open Enrollment.”</strong> According to a press release from Insurance And Safety Fire Commissioner John King, “Commissioner John F. King announced today that Georgia Access, the State’s health insurance marketplace, successfully concluded the 2025 Open Enrollment (OE) period, enrolling over 1.5 million consumers for Plan Year (PY) 2025, including 225,000 new consumers who were not previously enrolled in coverage through Healthcare.gov. The State’s OE 2025 period marks the success of its innovative approach and its first year as a State-based Exchange (SBE) as well as its highest enrollment year ever. Georgia Access is now the second-largest SBE in the country. ‘We are extremely proud of the resounding success of this year’s Open Enrollment. Most importantly, we are thrilled to be helping more Georgians than ever before secure affordable health coverage,’ said Commissioner King. ‘Our goal for OE 2025 was to reduce the number of uninsured Georgians and institute an innovative enrollment process by partnering with private sector entities, simplifying the enrollment process for consumers. As a result, Georgians are left with a true no-wrong door approach to getting health coverage.’” [Press Release – Commissioner John King, <a href="https://oci.georgia.gov/press-releases/2025-01-29/georgias-first-open-enrollment-period-state-based-exchange-ends-record"><u>1/29/25</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] King Thought Georgia Access Was “Vastly Superior” To “Government Run Insurance” Under The Affordable Care Act.</strong> “You know, we've done something truly remarkable in Georgia. First of all, to Governor Kemp and the legislature, they, we pulled out of the Affordable Care Act, which was really not serving the needs of Georgians. And so, we established a marketplace where private health companies would compete for Georgia consumers and their business. And as a result, we've been able to sign up over 1.5 million Georgians for private health insurance coverage, which is superior, vastly superior than then, you know, government run insurance. And we have 225,000 new customers who've never had insurance before. So, we're surpassing all records. We've outperformed any other state in the nation, and we outperformed in many metrics. The ACA, which is run out of Washington.” [Martha Zoller Show, 1/20/25]</p>
<h4><strong><u>King Claimed That Georgia Access, His State’s Health Care Marketplace, Lowered Rates By “15% To 17% In Rural Areas”</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>King Slammed The Affordable Care Act And Claimed That “So Many Of The Fees That Were Being Generated From Georgia Were Going To Washington To Pay For Part Of The ACA And Georgia Wasn't Getting A Lot Of That Money Back.”</strong> According to The Center Square, “More than 1.5 million Georgians enrolled in the state's new health care exchange, Insurance Commissioner John King said. Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced a bill that would expand Medicaid. The numbers for Georgia Access during the open enrollment period include 225,000 who did not participate previously in Healthcare.gov, King said. The plan has lowered rates by 15% to 17% in rural areas, King previously told The Center Square. It also keeps money in the state, he said. ‘So many of the fees that were being generated from Georgia were going to Washington to pay for part of the ACA and Georgia wasn't getting a lot of that money back,’ King said. ‘It was being distributed across the nation. And so this was a strategy of keeping the burden off of the taxpayer and the fee generated off this marketplace solution will stay in Georgia, will fund the reinsurance bucket which reduces the rates for insurance companies and brings competition across the state.’” [Center Square, <a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/georgia/article_f2f2ee5c-df03-11ef-81b4-f3e37c45657c.html"><u>1/30/25</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>King: “Our Goal For OE 2025 Was To Reduce The Number Of Uninsured Georgians And Institute An Innovative Enrollment Process By Partnering With Private Sector Entities, Simplifying The Enrollment Process For Consumers.”</strong> According to The Center Square, “The plan faced pushback from residents who asked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to block it. King said previously the federal government was reluctant at first but, over the past year, partnered with the state to get the program off the ground successfully. ‘Our goal for OE 2025 was to reduce the number of uninsured Georgians and institute an innovative enrollment process by partnering with private sector entities, simplifying the enrollment process for consumers,’ King said, referring to open enrollment. ‘As a result, Georgians are left with a true no-wrong door approach to getting health coverage.’” [Center Square, <a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/georgia/article_f2f2ee5c-df03-11ef-81b4-f3e37c45657c.html"><u>1/30/25</u></a>]</li>

[...] King says anyone who receives one of the letters should reach out to his office and they will make sure their insurance coverage is active.

<h3><strong>King Approved An Insurers’ Mega-Merger Over Medical Association Warnings That it Would Stifle Competition And Harm Medicaid Patients</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>2020: Centene And WellCare’s Merger Created A Singular Insurance Conglomerate Representing Over 800,000 Medicaid And PeachCare Members Across Georgia</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Georgia Health News Warned That Centene And WellCare’s Merger Created “A Company With A Dominant Position In Georgia’s Managed Care Marketplace For Medicaid.” </strong>According to Georgia Health News, “The merger of insurers Centene and WellCare will create a company with a dominant position in Georgia’s managed care market for Medicaid. The $17 billion deal, which closed Thursday, will give the resulting entity roughly two-thirds of the Medicaid HMO business in the state. And that market power has medical providers worried about the company driving tougher bargains in setting rates for reimbursements on medical services. Leading pharmacy and physician organizations opposed the merger here in Georgia, but the deal received state regulatory approval in September. Such consolidation has shaken up the health insurance industry, just as it has the hospital marketplace.” [Georgia Health News, <a href="https://www.georgiahealthnews.com/2020/01/big-merger-medicaid-insurance-equation-georgia/#:~:text=The%20merger%20of%20insurers%20Centene,HMO%20business%20in%20the%20state."><u>1/24/20</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Other States Required Divestment For The Merger To Move Forward. </strong>According to Georgia Health News, “Before the deal closed, Centene and WellCare made previous moves to divest certain Medicaid plans in order to get federal and state approval for the merger. CVS Health bought Centene’s Medicare and Medicaid plans in Illinois, and Anthem acquired WellCare’s Medicare and Medicaid plans in Missouri and Nebraska. Such spinoffs didn’t happen in Georgia.” [Georgia Health News, <a href="https://www.georgiahealthnews.com/2020/01/big-merger-medicaid-insurance-equation-georgia/#:~:text=The%20merger%20of%20insurers%20Centene,HMO%20business%20in%20the%20state."><u>1/24/20</u></a>]</li>
