<h2><strong>King Ran A Notorious Metro Atlanta Speed Trap&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>King Was Well Aware Of His Officer’s Gratuitous Ticketing And Raked In The Same Amount Of Ticket Revenue As A City With A Population Nine Times Larger</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Called Doraville “One Of The Most Aggressive Police Forces In The State” And Claimed That “The City Collects More Traffic Fines Per Capita Than Any Other In Metro Atlanta” While Spending Half Their Budget On Policing. </strong>According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “As he drives west on I-285 toward his job in Cobb County, Jason Bell often sees Doraville police cruisers lying in wait for speeders. On May 4 they caught him — 79 in a 55. He says he was just going with the flow of traffic at 7:30 a.m. on a Saturday, something that’s not hard to believe about the top-end Perimeter. In fact, when it comes to traffic tickets, he was nailed by one of the most aggressive police forces in the state. Doraville police write an average of 40 tickets a day, most of them on the city’s 2.7-mile stretch of I-285. The city collects more traffic fines per capita than any other in metro Atlanta, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has found. It also devotes nearly half the city budget to police department operations.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/transportation/atlanta-ticket-traps-slow-down-pay/6JZfycaeaKQ3jYJGRxtHII/"><u>10/18/14</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Atlanta Journal-Constitution: “Doraville Collected Almost The Same Amount Of Total Ticket Revenue As Roswell, A City With A Population Nine Times Larger.” </strong>According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “Roswell: 94,000 people, $9 million in fines; Doraville: 10,600 people, $9 million in fines [...] But even anecdotally, Doraville appears to be an outlier when it comes to ticket revenue. Doraville collected almost the same amount of total ticket revenue as Roswell, a city with a population nine times larger.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/transportation/atlanta-ticket-traps-slow-down-pay/6JZfycaeaKQ3jYJGRxtHII/"><u>10/18/14</u></a>]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Found That Doraville Issued A Majority Of Their Tickets On I-285; King’s Officers Issued 3,000 More Tickets Than Roswell, Which Had A Police Force Triple Doraville’s Size,&nbsp; And Averaged 3 Tickets Per Officer. </strong>According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “Last year, the Roswell Police Department’s 143 officers issued 11,435 citations. By contrast, the Doraville Police Department with a force one-third that size issued 14,560 traffic tickets last year — an average of three tickets per officer per shift, Gillen said. A majority of those were written on I-285, officials said.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/transportation/atlanta-ticket-traps-slow-down-pay/6JZfycaeaKQ3jYJGRxtHII/"><u>10/18/14</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>2012: Doraville’s Ticketing Accounted For 17% of The City’s Revenue. </strong>According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “The AJC compared data that local governments are required to report annually to the Georgia Department of Community Affairs on their annual revenue and found 53 cities and counties where ticket revenue accounted for more a tenth of overall income. Doraville was among them at 17 percent in 2012, as well as Lithonia (18 percent), Jonesboro (15 percent), Riverdale (14 percent) and Pine Lake and Avondale Estates (12 percent).” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/transportation/atlanta-ticket-traps-slow-down-pay/6JZfycaeaKQ3jYJGRxtHII/"><u>10/18/14</u></a>]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Former Doraville Councilman Claimed Doraville’s Officers Were “Dialing For Dollars” On I-285 To Cover The City’s Ballooning Police Budget. </strong>According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “But former Doraville councilman Tom Hart, who lost a mayoral bid in 2011, said too much of the city’s money is sucked up by police services that don’t really serve the average citizen. The 46 percent of its budget that Doraville devotes to police is the second-highest among more than two dozen metro Atlanta jurisdictions (barely trailing Jonesboro at 47 percent). ‘They are not in the neighborhoods,’ complained Hart, who remains active in city politics. ‘They’re up on I-285, on Buford Highway and those other roads dialing for dollars.’” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/transportation/atlanta-ticket-traps-slow-down-pay/6JZfycaeaKQ3jYJGRxtHII/"><u>10/18/14</u></a>]</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>King Told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution He Was “Well Aware” Of Doraville’s Speed Trap But Claimed He Was Diverting More Officers To Neighborhood Policing. </strong>According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “Doraville Police John King is well aware of the city’s ticket trap reputation. King said he has fought to change that perception in recent years by abolishing the traffic unit and diverting more attention to neighborhood policing. He said officers don’t even issue speeding tickets unless a driver is traveling more than 20 mph over the speed limit.” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/transportation/atlanta-ticket-traps-slow-down-pay/6JZfycaeaKQ3jYJGRxtHII/"><u>10/18/14</u></a>]</li>
