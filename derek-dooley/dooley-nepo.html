You were sitting in somebody's house who might not look like you think, like you act like you in any way. And you're trying to develop a level of common ground and trust to where they are going to send their son for you for four years. All right. To help not only build him as a player, but also improve him as a young man to help better their life and create opportunity. And for me, that's how I want to serve the people of Georgia.

But I was a part of some teams where I got my teeth kicked in. I mean, it was tough. And I think what people don't understand is what's happening during that week after you're having a tough time with your what do you learn from it? All right.
