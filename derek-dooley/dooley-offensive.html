<h2><strong>Dooley Frequently Misquoted Or Misremembered Historical Figures, Events, And Books</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Dooley Misquoted Winston Churchill During A Football Press Conference</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Dooley Misquoted Winston Churchill During A Football Press Conference. </strong>According to The Breeze, “Speaking with reporters about playing in the high altitude of Laramie, Wyoming, Dooley chose to quote Winston Churchill. Except, he didn't. Quoting the United Kingdom's most famous prime minister, Dooley said, ‘When you fight in the inter-Nordic, you've got to train in the Nordic.’ The problem? The British Bulldog never said that. Dooley chuckles when that fact is brought to his attention. The Churchill moment, though, was far from the first time Dooley has pulled his wide breadth of historical knowledge into his football sphere, not even close. Answers to questions about offensive formations or personnel decisions often veer toward historical events when he's at the podium.” [Breeze, 9/29/19]</p>

  <li><strong>[AUDIO] Dooley: “I Mean, Well, We Can't Fly Into The Mountains And Train ‘Em, You Know What I Mean? I Think It Was Churchill. Didn’t He Say When You Fight And You’re In The Nordic, You've Got To Train In The Nordic? But We Can't Do That. Alright?” </strong>“DOOLEY: I mean, well, we can't fly into the mountains and train ‘em, you know what I mean? I think it was Churchill. Didn’t he say when you fight and you’re in the Nordic, you've got to train in the Nordic? But we can't do that. Alright? So we can't just take our team and go train in the altitude for a week. But there are things you can do hydration wise, you know, taking care of your body, and just recognizing that, you know, probably in pregame, you're going to breathe a little bit. It's just wind, and then we'll be fine. So, it's only a problem if you make it a problem.” [That SEC Football Podcast, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/derek-dooley-that-sec-football-podcast-82819/s-XpVIOFg7Z73?si=d790edc11e15437cb5fd8e5735346aef&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>8/28/19</u></a>]</li>

<h3><strong>Dooley Compared His Tennessee Volunteers To Germany During World War 2</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Dooley Spent Two Minutes On A WWII History Lesson During Media Day And Said The Volunteers Were “Like The Germans In World War II.” </strong>According to ESPN, “Dooley spent two minutes during his weekly media appearance describing the confusion caused by the surprise landing of the Americans at Omaha Beach on D-Day and the Germans' slow reaction in the absence of their leader, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. ‘Right now we're like the Germans in World War II,’ Dooley said. ‘Here comes the boats, they're coming. You have the binoculars, and it's like, 'Oh, my God, the invasion is coming.' ‘ Tennessee (2-5, 0-4 Southeastern Conference) is playing with a depleted lineup because of injuries and attrition from back-to-back coaching turnovers. The Vols have lost three straight games.” [ESPN, <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=5726924"><u>10/25/10</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Dooley Compared Tennessee's Inability To Handle Difficult Game Situations To How The Germans Handled The D-Day Invasion And Clarified That He Was “Not Attacking” The Germans And Did Not “Want The German People To Get Upset With Me.” </strong>According to ESPN, “Dooley compared Tennessee's inability to handle difficult game situations to how the Germans handled the D-Day invasion. ‘I don't want the German people to get upset at me,’ he said. ‘I'm not attacking them, but that's what happened. You had one group, they weren't worried about what the plan was and orders and all that. When the war hits, things change. You've got to go. ‘You had the other group, and they go, 'Wait a minute, they told us the invasion was way further north,' where we had the empty tanks and we were hiding Patton out. 'We weren't ready for this, now what do we do?' 'We better wait until Rommel tells us what to do.'’ [ESPN, <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=5726924"><u>10/25/10</u></a>]</li>
  <li><strong>[VIDEO] Dooley: “You Know, Right Now We're Like The Germans In World War Two. All Right. Here Comes The Boats. It’s Coming. You Know The Binoculars. Oh, My God, The Invasion Is Coming.” </strong>“You know, right now we're like the Germans in World War Two. All right. Here comes the boats. It’s coming. You know the binoculars. Oh, my God, the invasion is coming. That's what they did. They were in the bunkers. It's coming. They call Rommel. They can't find Rommel. What do we do?&nbsp; I'm not doing anything until I get orders. You got Rommel yet? Alright and the Americans were exact opposite. We hit the beach and we're on the wrong spot. What do we do?&nbsp; I don't know, but these guys are firing. We better go hide over there and blow some stuff up to get up there. You know, they weren't looking for — and, I mean, that's where we've got to make that transition. I don't want the German people to get upset at me. I'm not attacking. But that's what happened.” [Derek Dooley Press Conference, <a href="https://youtu.be/QNrQOhaJH7Q"><u>10/25/10</u></a>]</li>

<h4><strong><u>Dooley Later Defended His D-Day Analogy</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Dooley Defended His D-Day Analogy And Doubled Down On His Perceived Similarities Between War And Football. </strong>According to The Breeze, “Dooley still shakes his head at the reaction that came from it all. There's something analogous between history and football, Dooley believes. And while he is careful when comparing war and foreign politics to something as relatively inconsequential as football, Dooley sees similarities between them and the sport he coaches, which is why quotes from Churchill and analogies to long ago battles sometimes ‘pop up in my head.’ ‘Football is nothing like war, but it is the closest thing to me,’ he says. ‘If you take the life and death piece out of it - which you can't - it's this thing where guys are out there and they're together and they're fighting for a common cause. It's a similar dynamic. That's why I think a lot of football coaches are into war.’ ‘I don't plan any of (the analogies), but football, for whatever reason, reminds me of these things.’” [Breeze, 9/29/19]</p>
<h2><strong>Dooley Did Not Root For Georgia Football</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>2016: Dooley Said “No” When Asked If He Rooted For Georgia Football</strong></h3>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Dooley Said “No” When Asked If He Rooted For Georgia Football.</strong> “ CLAY TRAVIS: If Tennessee and Georgia play today in football, do you root for one team or the other?
