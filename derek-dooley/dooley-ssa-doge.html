<p><strong>[AUDIO] Dooley Claimed We Were “In A Fiscal Crisis Because The Government Spends Too Much Of Our Money, Taxpayer Money,” So He Wanted To “Get All This Grift Out Of The System. Fraud, Waste, Abuse. People Are Stealing From Our Government. And So, I Support Every Bit Of What DOGE Intention Was.”</strong> “HOST: Did you support the DOGE efforts to restructure federal government and dismantle some federal agencies? DOOLEY: Well, look, let's go back to it's all how you look at it. Again, we are in a fiscal crisis because the government spends too much of our money, taxpayer money. They spend too much. So, what's a way to get them to stop spending? Well, the most obvious first step should be, again, let's get all this grift out of the system. Fraud, waste, abuse. People are stealing from our government. And so, I support every bit of what DOGE intention was, which was to go in. Let's eliminate fraud, waste and abuse. Let's get more efficient in our systems that probably hadn't been updated since the eighties and keep chipping away at being a lot more efficient government, more fiscally responsive and better equipped to serve the people who need help from the federal government.” [Politically Georgia, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/ada588ce-46ef-475c-80af-9037f4a7f674/s-wFPpKVkm5bV?si=71eafa63c2e34671aa31b5b320e27375&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>8/25/25</u></a>]</p>
