<h2><strong>Dooley Cheered For Trump’s Tariffs And Dismissed Georgians’ Pain</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Dooley Expressed Support For Trump’s Tariffs&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Dooley Downplayed Trump’s Tariffs’ Impacts On Georgia Businesses</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>[AUDIO] Dooley Claimed There Was A “Fiscal Crisis” From The Biden Administration Which Meant “The President In His Administration Recognizes It, And They're Doing Everything They Can To Try To Work Toward Having Some Fiscal Responsibility. And Tariffs Are A Part Of That.”</strong> “HOST: Do you support these tariffs and how would you work to help these businesses kind of navigate their way through the push and pull of different tariffs. DOOLEY: Yeah. Well, let's start with two main points here. Number one, everybody needs to realize we're in a fiscal crisis. I mean, the Biden administration, our budget and deficit issues right now are a disgrace. It's an embarrassment because of what they've done. And so, the president in his administration recognizes it, and they're doing everything they can to try to work toward having some fiscal responsibility. And tariffs are a part of that. All right.” [Politically Georgia, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/e58d463f-f013-4590-a12e-aef8177cb102/s-qLNK3qPXxdV?si=eae55316bee247e58c6a7df377be0141&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>8/25/25</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>[AUDIO] Dooley Admitted That Tariffs Were “Probably A Little Chaotic For Businesses” But Claimed That “This Is What Happens When You Have Hard Change To Try To Fix A Disaster The Biden Administration Had” And Lauded Trump’s Trade Deals.</strong> “DOOLEY: The second thing to think about is I think everybody should want fair trade all right around the world. And so, President Trump was adamant that we had these unfair trade deals around the world that hurt hurt all our American companies. Okay. So that's first principles on why we're doing what we're doing. All right. What's happened so far? Is it probably a little chaotic for businesses? I'm sure it's definitely. But this is this is what happens when you have hard change to try to fix a disaster the Biden administration had. But we've had a tremendous amount of revenue coming in. But more importantly, we've we've seen some fair-trade deals level out and we now have some certainty. You look at what's happened with the EU, you look at what's happened with Japan. And I'm hopeful over time, as these trade deals continue, it'll be a real calming effect for all of our businesses in Georgia so everybody can get a strategy going forward.” [Politically Georgia, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/abpac/8d92fc7c-64dc-457b-a1e2-4dede0ab7ccc/s-dVvnxaJGRKS?si=5c24027d05a446e49eb07dad32d62f9b&amp;utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><u>8/25/25</u></a>]</li>

<h3><strong>Trump’s Tariffs Put Georgia’s Economy At Risk&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Georgia Businesses Braced For “Higher Costs, Tighter Margins, And Increased Uncertainty” Under Trump’s Tariffs</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Georgia Businesses Braced For “Higher Costs, Tighter Margins, And Increased Uncertainty” Under Trump’s Tariffs. </strong>According to Fox 5 Atlanta, “While the Trump administration argues that long-term gains in domestic investment will outweigh short-term disruption, the outcome will depend heavily on how global trade partners respond–and how quickly new deals, if any, are created. For now, businesses across Georgia are bracing for potentially higher costs, tighter margins, and increased uncertainty” [Fox 5 Atlanta, <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/trumps-tariff-plan-sparks-economic-uncertainty-georgia"><u>4/8/25</u></a>]</p>
