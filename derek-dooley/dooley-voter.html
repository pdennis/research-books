<h2><strong>Dooley Was Not Registered As A Republican And Didn’t Vote For Trump Until 2024</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Dooley’s Voter History</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Dooley Never Registered As A Republican And Did Not Vote For Trump In 2016 And 2020</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Dooley Did Not Vote In The 2016 Nor 2020 Elections While Registered In Texas And New York, Respectively, Never Donated To Trump Or Any Trump Affiliates, And Was Now Registered To Vote In Georgia Without Party Affiliation.</strong> According to the Washington Examiner, “Though he has the backing of Gov. Brian Kemp, Dooley has consistently opted not to support Trump at the ballot box or through financial contributions. Voter records show he didn’t cast a ballot in any Texas election in 2016 while living and working there, and similarly sat out New York elections in 2020, according to that state’s Board of Elections. Dooley declined to register as a Republican, even as his wife did so in multiple states, according to public records. In 2005, he registered with no party affiliation in Florida while his wife registered as a Republican. The same pattern occurred in 2020 when they registered in New York. Georgia, where Dooley now resides, does not require voters to declare a party affiliation. As of July 2025, federal campaign finance records show Dooley has never donated to Trump or any affiliated group. His only reported political contribution: $5,500 to Kemp’s campaign.” [Washington Examiner, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/3479203/derek-dooley-voting-record-possible-gop-senate-run/"><u>7/23/25</u></a>]</p>
<h5><i>Dooley’s Team Preempted The Carpetbagger Accusations And Downplayed His Non-Republican Voter Registration, Claiming He “Always Identified As A Republican” And Voted For Trump In 2024</i></h5>
<p><strong>Dooley’s Team Preempted The Carpetbagger Accusations And Downplayed His Non-Republican Voter Registration, Claiming He “Always Identified As A Republican” And Voted For Trump In 2024.</strong> According to the Washington Examiner, “Dooley’s team has dismissed the criticism, framing it as evidence that political insiders feel threatened by an outsider. ‘The amount of fear and desperation coming from career politicians about an outsider who hasn’t even announced yet should tell Georgia voters all they need to know,’ said Dooley spokesperson Connor Whitney in a statement to the Washington Examiner. ‘Like most Georgians, Derek built a life around his family, a job he loved, and helping young people succeed, not politics. These lame attacks are predictable and laughable.’ An adviser to Dooley said the former football coach has always identified as a Republican and voted for Republican candidates, including Trump and Kemp. The adviser noted that Georgia doesn’t require voters to register by party. Records show Dooley voted in the 2024 election in Georgia, his most recent voter activity.” [Washington Examiner, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/3479203/derek-dooley-voting-record-possible-gop-senate-run/"><u>7/23/25</u></a>]</p>

<p><strong>Dooley Claimed “There Was A Time In My Career Where I Was Overly Focused On My Job And My Family,” Which Precluded Him From Voting; He Said That “COVID And The Biden Administration Changed Me … That’s Why I Proudly Got Involved And Started Voting, And That’s Why I’m Here Today.” </strong>According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “On skipping presidential elections, including the 2016 and 2020 votes: ‘Well, I did vote for President Trump in 2024 and I did vote for Gov. Kemp. There was a time in my career where I was overly focused on my job and my family. COVID and the Biden administration changed me … That’s why I proudly got involved and started voting, and that’s why I’m here today.’ On not voting in 2020, even after COVID ‘I voted in 2024 for Donald Trump. What happened with the Biden administration after COVID — that’s what changed me. I saw the disasters that were happening around our country that I never thought I’d see again. And I was so frustrated with the leadership and it motivated me to get in the game. And that’s what I did.’ On why voters should back him despite not voting in past elections: ‘Well, I did vote. And that’s why they should vote for me. I voted for Donald Trump. I voted for Gov. Kemp, and I’m going to ask everybody to come vote for me.’” [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/08/derek-dooley-casts-himself-as-the-senate-outsider-who-can-win/"><u>8/25/25</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>[VIDEO] Dooley Said He Was “Proud Of” His 2024 Votes For Trump And Governor Kemp But Again Admitted “There Was A Time In My Career Where I Was Moving State To State And Focused On The Job And Family, And Didn't Make It To The Polls.”</strong> “Well, I voted for Donald Trump and I'm proud of it, and I voted for Governor Kemp and I'm proud of it. There was a time in my career where I was moving state to state and focused on the job and family, and didn't make it to the polls. But, you know, the Biden administration and COVID changed that for me. It really woke me up when I saw things happening in our country that I never thought could happen. And that's what really led me to get, get into the game, be more active, and ultimately run for U.S. Senate here in Georgia.” [WRBL (CBS): The Sunday Conversation, <a href="https://youtu.be/9oy0-EfRNes"><u>8/24/25</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Dooley Rehashed His Voting Record And His Motivation For Entering Politics; He Thought His Candidacy Was “Generating Some Interest From People Who Maybe Haven’t Voted And Need To Get Out There And Do Their Civic Duty.”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;According to the Marietta Daily Journal, “Q: Some of your primary opponents have attacked you for not voting in 2016 and 2020. What’s your response to the critics who claim that you’re not a true MAGA Republican? A: Well, I can address the voting issue, and my only response is yes, there was a time in my life when I was immersed in my job — and it’s not an excuse by any means — where I was moving state to state and didn’t go to the polls. But I did vote for Governor Kemp in ’22 and I voted for President Trump in ’24. And what happened really was I had to get woken up a little bit by what happened after COVID and what happened during the Biden administration. And so I think what’s important for me is that I do my best to communicate to voters how important these elections are. That it does impact your day to day life, and hopefully all those people who always vote will come out to vote for me, but also, that I’ll be generating some interest from people who maybe haven’t voted and need to get out there and do their civic duty.” [Marietta Daily Journal, <a href="https://www.mdjonline.com/elections/q-a-derek-dooley-on-senate-campaign-government-shutdown/article_5a8c7698-b31f-4333-9a17-a864101a418b.html"><u>11/8/25</u></a><strong>]</strong></p>
