  <li><strong>2018: HB 5002 Included Medicaid Expansion That Covered An Additional 400,000 Low-Income Adults In The Commonwealth. </strong>According to The New York Times, “Virginia’s Republican-controlled Senate voted on Wednesday to open Medicaid to an additional 400,000 low-income adults next year, making it all but certain that the state will join&nbsp;32 others that have already expanded&nbsp;the public health insurance program under the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp;Republican lawmakers in the state had blocked&nbsp;Medicaid expansion&nbsp;for four straight years, but a number of them dropped their opposition after their party almost lost the House of Delegates in elections last fall and voters named health care as a top issue.&nbsp;The vote, on a budget bill that included the&nbsp;Medicaid expansion, came almost three months after the House approved a similar plan. Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat also elected last fall, has been a vocal proponent of the expansion and can now claim a victory that his predecessor, Terry McAuliffe, desperately wanted but never got.” [New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/health/medicaid-expansion-virginia.html"><u>5/30/18</u></a>]&nbsp;</li>
