Jackson Women's Health Organization&nbsp;Richmond, VA – Victoria LaCivita, spokesperson for Attorney General Jason Miyares, has issued the following statement regarding the Supreme Court's decision in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.&nbsp;‘Today the Supreme Court ruled that the issue of abortion should not be decided by unelected federal judges, but by the people of the States through their elected representatives. Good and reasonable people can disagree on this issue but now Virginians, not federal judges, can decide its future. The Attorney General will continue to uphold and enforce both the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of Virginia.’”&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><u>Miyares Removed Virginia From A Brief Supporting Roe V. Wade And Asked The Supreme Court To Overturn The Ruling</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2022: Miyares Filed A Motion To Remove Virginia From A Brief Urging The Supreme Court Not To Overturn Roe V. Wade, Arguing That “Virginia No Longer Adheres To The Arguments Contained In Its Previously Filed Brief.” </strong>According to National Review, “Under Herring’s leadership, Virginia joined nearly two dozen progressive states in filing a Supreme Court&nbsp;brief&nbsp;in&nbsp;Dobbs, a case considering the constitutionality of a Mississippi law protecting unborn children after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The brief, led by California, argued that Mississippi’s law is unconstitutional and urged the Court not to overrule precedents such as&nbsp;Roe v. Wade&nbsp;and&nbsp;Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which created and upheld a supposed constitutional right to abortion.&nbsp;The brief also asserted that overturning the Court’s abortion jurisprudence would have a number of negative effects on the states and their citizens.&nbsp;Now, at the end of his first week in office, Miyares is seeking to remove Virginia as a signatory to this pro-abortion brief. In a copy of his motion obtained exclusively by&nbsp;National Review, Miyares writes ‘that Virginia no longer adheres to the arguments contained in its previously filed brief [and] is now of the view that the Constitution is silent on the&nbsp;question of abortion, and that it is therefore up to the people in the several States to determine the legal status and regulatory treatment of abortion.’” [National Review, <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/exclusive-virginia-attorney-general-files-to-remove-state-support-from-pro-abortion-dobbs-brief/"><u>1/21/22</u></a>]&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Miyares Wrote In His Motion That Roe V. Wade Was “Wrongly Decided,” And Asked The Supreme Court To Overturn The Ruling. </strong>According to National Review, “The motion goes on to ask the Court to uphold Mississippi’s law, arguing that Roe and Casey should be overturned. ‘It is Virginia’s position that the Court’s decisions in&nbsp;Roe&nbsp;and&nbsp;Casey&nbsp;were wrongly decided,’ the motion concludes. ‘Unmoored from the Constitution’s text, the Court’s abortion jurisprudence has proven unworkable, and the Court’s effort to save it has distorted other areas of the law. This Court should restore judicial neutrality to the abortion debate by permitting the people of the several States to resolve these questions for themselves.’” [National Review, <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/exclusive-virginia-attorney-general-files-to-remove-state-support-from-pro-abortion-dobbs-brief/"><u>1/21/22</u></a>]&nbsp;</li>
