# Higher Education and Student Support

### Summary

> * Hinson strongly opposed federal student loan forgiveness, repeatedly arguing it unfairly shifts debt to taxpayers and primarily benefits middle- and higher-income borrowers, a stance that could alienate struggling student borrowers ([Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65TY-K6K1-DXVP-V1DY-00000-00&context=1519360), [Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65V6-W7N1-DXVP-V1MK-00000-00&context=1519360)).

> * Focus on workforce-oriented education, such as technical and trade programs, may be seen as de-emphasizing traditional four-year degrees, potentially alienating those who value a broader higher education focus ([Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F66-DF03-SF09-842C-00000-00&context=1519360), [Iowa Public Radio](https://www.iowapublicradio.org/ipr-news/2024-10-31/2nd-district-republican-ashley-hinson-democrat-sarah-corkery-2024-election)).
