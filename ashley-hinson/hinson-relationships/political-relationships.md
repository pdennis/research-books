### Relationship with Nancy Pelosi

**2021: Letter Writer Tanya Burgess Criticized Ashley Hinson's Rhetoric After U.S. Capitol Breach** According to a letter to the editor published in Des Moines Register, "It is appalling to me that the day of and the day after our nation's Capitol was breached by domestic terrorists, Hinson went on social media accusing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of trying to steal Iowa's 2nd District election. These are the same words the president used to incite his followers to breach the halls of the Capitol. In one breath she calls for a stop to violence and in the next she calls on her supporters to stop the steal and says 'this is not a drill.'"

In my mind, it's imperative we get that decided so we can move forward (and) we can heal as a conference, but we can also do the work that people sent us there to do. We need to get back to work for the American people."'
