**2025: Letter Writer Michael Henning Criticized Ashley Hinson's Federal Agency Relocation Proposal** According to a letter to the editor published in Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier, "Hinson also fell short on proposal to move agencies out of Washington. Why just move the agencies? It would be better to just eliminate them. Iowa already has an ag division and a state transportation division. So at least the national USDA and transportation agencies can be shut down along with the Department of Education as they relate to Iowa."
