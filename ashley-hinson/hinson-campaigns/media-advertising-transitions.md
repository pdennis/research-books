# Media Relations, Advertising, and Staff Transitions

### Summary

> * In 2020, multiple outlets including the New York Times and Iowa newspapers reported that Ashley Hinson’s campaign materials and op-eds contained plagiarized content from various sources, including the New York Times, Des Moines Register, CNBC, The Hill, and her opponent Abby Finkenauer's platform ([The Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60DC-MDV1-DXVP-V106-00000-00&context=1519360), [Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60DH-KPF1-JCDM-J0B1-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Hinson publicly apologized for the plagiarism, emphasizing she was unaware of the copied content at the time drafts were reviewed, and attributed responsibility to campaign staff and the consulting firm FP1 Strategies ([Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60DD-FSD1-JBCN-44SY-00000-00&context=1519360), [Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60GX-TK81-JBCN-42GH-00000-00&context=1519360)).

> * As part of campaign tactics, Hinson’s team created a website and staged publicity stunts (e.g., the chicken suit “Lefty Chickenauer”) to challenge Finkenauer for more debates and to attract media attention ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60Y7-KB11-DYWP-842H-00000-00&context=1519360), [Quad-City Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60Y9-K691-JBCN-40MX-00000-00&context=1519360)).
