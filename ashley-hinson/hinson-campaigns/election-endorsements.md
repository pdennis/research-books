# Election Campaigns and Political Endorsements

### Summary

> * Hinson has been repeatedly targeted by national Democratic groups, including the DCCC, which has labeled her seat "vulnerable" and pledged to invest in campaigns against her in upcoming cycles ([Daily Nonpareil](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FJ8-56X3-S7KM-T1K4-00000-00&context=1519360)).

> * Attack ads and campaign messaging from opponents have characterized Hinson as a "rubber-stamp" for Republican leadership and the Biden-Trump partisan divide, suggesting she is not sufficiently independent or bipartisan ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69GG-WS41-DYWP-805P-00000-00&context=1519360); [Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BJM-S7G1-DXVP-T0BS-00000-00&context=1519360)).

> * While Hinson has raised significant campaign funds, her fundraising advantage could become a liability if national Democrats increase investment or if perceptions grow that outside money plays too large a role in her campaigns ([Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D7B-CCW1-DXVP-T2DK-00000-00&context=1519360)).
