# Legislative Relationships with Federal Agencies

### Collaboration with Army Corps of Engineers

**2021: Ashley Hinson Met with FEMA Officials on Flood Risk Transparency and Insurance Affordability** According to an opinion piece by Ashley Hinson in Gazette, "In a meeting with FEMA officials this week, I reiterated that Iowans need to understand their flood risk and should be able to afford insurance if required. I will continue to work directly with FEMA and hold the agency accountable so that Iowans have the certainty they deserve."
