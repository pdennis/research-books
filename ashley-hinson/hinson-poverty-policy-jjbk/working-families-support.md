**September 2022: Ashley Hinson Proposed Raising The Federal Child Tax Credit In Collaboration With Marco Rubio** According to Gazette, "Iowa Republican U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson joined U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to introduce legislation they say will provide support for expecting moms and families. The legislation combines existing bills with new proposals, including an expansion of the federal child tax credit." [Gazette, [9/16/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66F2-TFS1-JBCN-4312-00000-00&context=1519360)]

**2022: Hinson Introduced Child Tax Credit Legislation With Work Requirements** According to Gazette, "The American Rescue Plan Act also did not include work requirements, which Hinson's proposal does." [Gazette, [9/16/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66F2-TFS1-JBCN-4312-00000-00&context=1519360)]

**2022: Hinson-Rubio Bill Proposed Monthly Child Allowances And Other Family Support Provisions** According to Gazette, "Under the Hinson-Rubio bill, parents would receive a monthly child allowance of up to $4,500 for children aged 5 and below, and up to $3,500 for children aged 6 to 17. The new child care tax credit would maintain the current phaseout thresholds of $200,000 for single filers and $400,000 for married joint filers." [Gazette, [9/16/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66F2-TFS1-JBCN-4312-00000-00&context=1519360)]

**2022: Hinson Advocated For Expanding Access To Federal Resources And Grants For Families** According to Gazette, she said the package of bills "expands access to important federal resources and grant programs and recognizes the importance of community- and faith-based services, and it empowers parents to raise happy, healthy babies regardless of socio-economic status." [Gazette, [9/16/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66F2-TFS1-JBCN-4312-00000-00&context=1519360)]

**2022: Hinson Highlighted Child Tax Credit Expansion In Her Bill** According to Telegraph Herald, "A measure in the act highlighted by Hinson was its expansion of the federal Child Tax Credit to $3,600 for children ages 5 and younger and increases the credit from $3,000 to $4,500 for children 6 to 17. It also extends the credit to fetuses the year of a pregnancy. But, different from Child Tax Credit expansions proposed by Democrats in the past, Hinson's version has a work requirement, tying it to a parent's first dollar of income." [Telegraph Herald: Web Edition Articles (Dubuque, Iowa), [9/25/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:670N-4821-JBCN-413C-00000-00&context=1519360)]

**2022: Mathis Criticized Hinson’s Record On Child Tax And Formula Shortage Votes** According to Telegraph Herald, "Mathis said in a statement that Hinson's Providing for Life Act would do little to help Iowans in any case. 'Hinson's tax and WIC reform provisions ring hollow considering she voted against cutting taxes by $1,600 per child for Iowa families when it counted and voted against a bill to provide emergency funding to address shortages of infant baby formula,' she said."

**July 2023: Hinson’s Legislation Proposed Retroactive Child Tax Credit For Unborn Children** According to Gazette, "The package would also retroactively expand the tax credit to unborn children. When a dependent is born, parents would become eligible to claim the tax credit in the prior year during the pregnancy, in addition to gaining access to the regular child tax credit in the current tax year. Parents would use the baby’s Social Security number to avoid fraud."
