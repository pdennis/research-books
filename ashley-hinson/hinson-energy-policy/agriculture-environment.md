# Agriculture, Rural Issues, and Local Environmental Concerns

### Summary

> * Heavy reliance on federal funding requests for critical rural infrastructure improvements (drinking water, wastewater) could raise questions about sustainable local leadership and resource allocation ([Daily Nonpareil](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C77-27C1-JBCN-309Y-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Modernization needs for essential infrastructure—such as the outdated Independence wastewater plant—may indicate long-term neglect or insufficient prior investment ([Daily Nonpareil](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C77-27C1-JBCN-309Y-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Advocacy for year-round E15 biofuel sales, while popular in farming communities, could draw criticism from environmental groups and constituents concerned about air quality and longer-term climate impacts ([Daily Nonpareil](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BWH-X341-DXVP-T0VG-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * The push for permanent E15 sales despite only a temporary EPA waiver may highlight limited federal influence or effectiveness on energy policy outcomes ([Daily Nonpareil](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BWH-X341-DXVP-T0VG-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Focus on infrastructure and ethanol issues may leave other pressing rural concerns (such as farm support, broadband, and conservation) relatively unaddressed in public statements.

**2024: Ashley Hinson Requested $4 Million For Belle Plaine Drinking Water Resiliency Project** According to Daily Nonpareil, "Hinson requested the funding to support upgrades to the city of Belle Plaine's drinking water infrastructure. [...] The improvements would benefit 1,300 households, 120 businesses, three schools and two medical care facilities."

**2024: Ashley Hinson Requested $4 Million For Independence Wastewater Treatment Plant Replacement** According to Daily Nonpareil, "Hinson requested the funds to help the city of Independence modernize its wastewater treatment plant constructed in the 1970s. This project would include upgrades in the treatment process, including advanced biological treatment to remove nutrients and a new anaerobic digestion process to reduce sludge volume."

**2024: Hinson Stated Support For EPA's E15 Waiver But Called For Permanent Year-Round Sales** According to Daily Nonpareil, "'Expanding access to biofuels is a win for consumers, producers, and the environment,' Rep. Ashley Hinson said in a news release. 'EPA's waiver is a step in the right direction, but it's crucial that Iowa drivers and biofuel producers have long term certainty, so I will continue working to make the yearround sale of E15 permanent.'"
