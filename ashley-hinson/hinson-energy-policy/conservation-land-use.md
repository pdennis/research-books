# Conservation and Land Use

### Support for Land Conservation Initiatives

**2019: Todd Dorman Reported Ashley Hinson Voted to Prohibit Conservation Land Purchases With State Funds** According to an opinion piece by Todd Dorman in Gazette, "When the bill came to the House floor, Hinson, then a state representative, voted in favor." (referring to 2019 legislation prohibiting entities such as the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation from using the revolving fund to buy land for conservation purposes.) [Todd Dorman - Gazette, [10/9/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66K9-5D31-DXVP-V07M-00000-00&context=1519360)]

**August 2023: Hinson Advocated Protection Of Landowners’ Rights And Cautioned Use Of Eminent Domain** According to Globe Gazette, 'Hinson said Iowa must strike a balance of protecting landowners' property rights and the future of the ag economy, and is "always leery" of the use of eminent domain. "We do need to have robust laws in place to protect property owners and landowners," she said.'
