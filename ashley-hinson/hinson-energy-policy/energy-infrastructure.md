# Energy Production and Infrastructure

### Summary

> * Ashley Hinson consistently opposed President Biden’s 2021 bipartisan infrastructure bill, citing insufficient focus on Iowa’s priorities, but later advocated for and claimed credit for specific projects funded by the law—including Mississippi River lock and dam upgrades—drawing criticism for this stance ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:64MN-KY91-JCDM-J32B-00000-00&context=1519360), [Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:666W-D8R1-JBCN-42W2-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Hinson champions an “all-of-the-above” energy approach—supporting biofuels, fossil fuels (including the Keystone XL pipeline), and some renewable innovation—while expressing skepticism or opposition to federal mandates and funding for electric vehicles and green energy ([Des Moines Register](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C10-S181-JB1V-G030-00000-00&context=1519360), [Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C59-9HN1-JBCN-341H-00000-00&context=1519360)).

> 
> * Hinson frequently blames Biden administration policies for high energy costs, opposes tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and calls for increased domestic oil production and permitting reform while warning against rapid transitions away from liquid fuels ([Des Moines Register](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66JN-RPG1-JB1V-G0F3-00000-00&context=1519360), [Muscatine Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66R5-02T1-JBCN-400V-00000-00&context=1519360)).

> 
> * Potential vulnerability: Hinson routinely faces criticism and charges of inconsistency for opposing major federal infrastructure and clean energy bills, then seeking and publicizing investments those laws provide to Iowa ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:64MN-KY91-JCDM-J32B-00000-00&context=1519360), [Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:64MY-8991-JBCN-43GV-00000-00&context=1519360)).
