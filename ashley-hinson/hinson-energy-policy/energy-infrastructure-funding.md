# Infrastructure and Federal Funding for Energy Projects

### Summary

> 
> * Hinson successfully secured $2 million for the Dubuque sewer/water project and another $2 million for a sewer plant modernization project in Independence, Iowa, through a House appropriations bill in summer 2024, although the bill did not pass the Senate ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F8J-X0J3-RSKM-6214-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Despite setbacks at the federal level, Hinson's office indicated she remains committed to securing funding for these infrastructure projects in future budget negotiations ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F8P-HNN3-RTCP-1181-00000-00&context=1519360)).

> 
> * A potential vulnerability for these projects is the challenging political environment in Washington, where budgetary concerns and cost-cutting measures may limit the chances of securing new federal spending for infrastructure ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F8P-HNN3-RTCP-1181-00000-00&context=1519360)).
