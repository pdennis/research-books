# Abortion Policy Stance and Legislative Record

### Summary

> * Ashley Hinson has consistently supported significant abortion restrictions at both state and federal levels, including Iowa’s six-week “fetal heartbeat” law and federal “Life at Conception Act” proposals, which would define life as beginning at fertilization ([Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6D-VXP1-DXVP-T3G4-00000-00&context=1519360), [The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/fact-checker-does-ashley-hinson-support-criminalizing-abortions-with-no-exceptions/)).
> 
> * She has publicly stated her support for exceptions to abortion bans in cases of rape, incest, life of the mother, and in some cases, fatal fetal anomalies, and has said she would not vote for federal bans lacking such exceptions ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6G-VHN1-JBCN-3374-00000-00&context=1519360), [Des Moines Register](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6G-5R31-DXGX-64NJ-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Hinson has co-sponsored multiple national abortion ban bills, including a 15-week ban with exceptions and the “Life at Conception Act,” which, as written, generally lacks explicit exceptions and is seen by opponents as threatening access to abortion, some birth control methods, and IVF ([Iowa Starting Line](https://iowastartingline.com/2022/09/16/hinson-now-backs-national-abortion-ban-reverses-states-first-stance/), [The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/fact-checker-does-ashley-hinson-support-criminalizing-abortions-with-no-exceptions/)).
> 
> * She is a strong proponent of the Hyde Amendment, opposing federal funding for abortion, and has voted to restrict or eliminate funding to providers like Planned Parenthood ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:674M-2FD1-DYWP-8009-00000-00&context=1519360), [The Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CB5-TSG1-DXVP-T05B-00000-00&context=1519360)).

> 
> * Vulnerability: Hinson faces recurring criticism for backing bills without clear exceptions and for co-sponsoring legislation perceived as endangering access to IVF and some contraceptives, potentially creating political liabilities ([Des Moines Register](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C2G-JBS1-DXGX-635P-00000-00&context=1519360), [Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C1N-0PN1-DXVP-T095-00000-00&context=1519360)).
