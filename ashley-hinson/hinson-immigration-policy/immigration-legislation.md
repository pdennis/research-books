# Immigration Legislation and Congressional Actions

### Summary

> * Rep. Ashley Hinson has consistently supported reforms to expand and streamline legal immigration, especially advocating for improvements to visa programs like H-1B and Conrad 30 to address workforce shortages in sectors such as health care ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D3H-87J1-DXVP-T4XN-00000-00&context=1519360), [Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6943-TN31-DXVP-T52X-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Hinson opposes broad pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, having voted against multiple bills that would grant such pathways to DREAMers and agricultural workers, citing concerns these efforts go "too far" and could encourage illegal crossings ([Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6280-JRT1-JBCN-44GK-00000-00&context=1519360), [Des Moines Register](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DH1-5M11-JB1V-G3H0-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * She supports targeted legislative solutions for DACA recipients, publicly endorsing a "DACA fix" that allows eligible children brought to the U.S. as minors to remain, and has co-sponsored related bipartisan bills like the America's Children Act ([Des Moines Register](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DH1-5M11-JB1V-G3H0-00000-00&context=1519360), [Iowa City Press-Citizen](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DH7-4YC1-DXGX-60T9-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Hinson has introduced and supported legislation focused on enforcement, including bills to increase migrant data reporting and allow child fingerprinting at the border to combat trafficking, and has backed the Secure the Border Act (HR2) to increase enforcement and resume border wall construction ([Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69SF-G261-JBCN-305K-00000-00&context=1519360), [Des Moines Register](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C10-S181-JB1V-G030-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * She has opposed settlement payments for families separated at the border, leading GOP opposition to the proposal, and has argued for the Biden administration to reinstate some Trump-era immigration policies ([Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:64H8-W9M1-JBCN-449W-00000-00&context=1519360), [Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:62SD-KCW1-JCDM-J21Y-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Potential vulnerability: Hinson’s nuanced positions—such as supporting a legislative fix for DACA but voting against broader citizenship pathways—could draw criticism from both immigration reform advocates and hardline opponents, potentially reflecting a political balancing act ([Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DGT-HJD1-JBCN-32WG-00000-00&context=1519360)).
