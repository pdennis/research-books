### Summary

> * Hinson’s concern about deepfakes and harmful online content highlights potential gaps in existing tech regulation and enforcement to protect children, which could be seen as a vulnerability if not adequately addressed ([Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CMX-5C61-JBCN-31CC-00000-00&context=1519360), [Waterloo Courier (Iowa)](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CN3-KWR1-JBTP-M07Y-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * The frequently repeated call for bipartisan action may signal slow legislative progress, making Hinson and Congress vulnerable to criticism for inaction or delays in implementing protections ([Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CMX-5C61-JBCN-31CC-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Reliance on "Big Tech" to self-police could be perceived as insufficient, potentially exposing Hinson to attacks that stronger regulatory or enforcement measures are needed ([Waterloo Courier (Iowa)](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CN3-KWR1-JBTP-M07Y-00000-00&context=1519360)).

> 
> * Statements about bills preventing manipulation of children could open Hinson up to scrutiny about the efficacy and enforcement of such measures, especially if high-profile incidents occur despite new laws ([The Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BJ6-TX81-DXVP-T0B5-00000-00&context=1519360)).
