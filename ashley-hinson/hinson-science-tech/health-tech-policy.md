# Health, Science, and Technology Policy

### Summary

> * Hinson's aggressive push to force TikTok's Chinese owner to divest, citing national security, could be perceived as threatening to free expression or as targeting a popular youth platform, potentially alienating younger voters and raising privacy-versus-liberty concerns ([The Gazette, 4/30/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BXN-CWS1-DXVP-T1SR-00000-00&context=1519360))
> * By repeatedly framing TikTok and certain tech companies as security threats, Hinson risks being seen as favoring overbroad restrictions or neglecting nuanced, evidence-based tech policy, which may draw criticism from civil liberties advocates ([Gazette, 4/26/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BWT-H521-DXVP-T0DH-00000-00&context=1519360))
> * Efforts to carve out Section 230 protections and impose rapid takedown requirements on tech firms regarding deepfakes may attract opposition from free speech proponents and create friction with tech industry groups over regulation ([Daily Nonpareil, 8/1/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CMN-1921-JBCN-32JP-00000-00&context=1519360))
> * Emphasis on the national security threat posed by Chinese technology and algorithms could be interpreted as fueling anti-China sentiment, risking backlash from voters wary of xenophobic rhetoric or those seeking more balanced competition policies ([Telegraph Herald, 3/17/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BKD-NB61-DYWP-805C-00000-00&context=1519360))
> * Calls for targeted broadband funding and criticism of federal oversight, while resonant with fiscal conservatives, could be framed as obstructing or slowing down needed rural development by opponents, especially if local access improvements lag ([Telegraph Herald, 10/11/20](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6127-5W21-JCDM-J05N-00000-00&context=1519360))
