### Summary

> * Rep. Ashley Hinson has prioritized improving air travel accessibility for people with disabilities, particularly veterans with service animals, by organizing TSA screening demonstrations and advocating for standardized TSA procedures across airports ([Daily Nonpareil](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:692N-B3V1-DXVP-T1FH-00000-00&context=1519360), [Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6926-JKF1-JBCN-307M-00000-00&context=1519360), [Sioux City Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6927-CM31-DXVP-T1FT-00000-00&context=1519360)).
