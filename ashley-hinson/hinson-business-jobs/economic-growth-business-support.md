> 
> * She opposes broad federal mandates like a $15 minimum wage, arguing they would harm small businesses and rural economies, and favors reducing taxes, cutting regulations, and expanding targeted tax credits such as for research and development and the child tax credit ([Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:61X0-3PG1-DXVP-V3FX-00000-00), [Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D86-NTR1-JBCN-31XJ-00000-00)).
> 
> * Hinson has promoted policies to expand workforce participation (including child tax credit expansion), return manufacturing to the U.S., and enhance energy independence through an “all-of-the-above” strategy ([Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CSJ-YJ21-JBCN-30G7-00000-00), [Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CSN-MPF1-JBCN-3322-00000-00)).
> 
> * She frequently criticizes Democratic economic proposals, labeling plans like Vice President Harris’s as “government price fixing” and warning of shortages and negative effects on business ([Daily Nonpareil](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CSS-XW01-JBCN-30T8-00000-00), [Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CSS-H791-DXVP-T06M-00000-00)).
> 
> * Hinson draws bipartisan praise and business sector endorsements (e.g., U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Iowa Association of Business and Industry) for her “pro-jobs” and pro-business voting record, particularly her advocacy for regulatory reduction and rural economic investment ([Muscatine Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66J3-0BT1-DXVP-V0R8-00000-00), [Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66J5-NM91-DXVP-V2RH-00000-00)).
> 
> * Potential vulnerabilities: Inflation and reduced local spending continue to challenge small businesses, with Hinson acknowledging that high costs deter consumer purchases on main streets and calling for cost reduction to restore spending ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBP-38P1-JCDM-J02X-00000-00)).
