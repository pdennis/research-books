# Counterterrorism and National Security Measures

### Summary

> * Hinson’s support for classifying domestic gangs as “foreign terrorist organizations” could draw backlash for blurring the line between domestic crime and terrorism; critics may argue this is a legally dubious approach and raises civil liberties concerns. ([Des Moines Register](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/24/iowa-rep-ashley-hinson-town-hall-defends-donald-trump-agenda-mason-city/83229133007/), [Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FN7-RXH3-S5PB-S0MX-00000-00&context=1519360))
> * Repeated emphasis on using terrorism classifications to enable deportations may be seen as targeting immigrant communities and could intensify accusations of racial profiling or xenophobia.

> * Calls for DOJ investigations into pro-Hamas groups risk being characterized as government overreach or as a threat to free speech when used broadly against advocacy organizations.

> * Public condemnation of pro-Hamas demonstrations could be viewed as conflating political protest with support for terrorism, raising concerns over curbing constitutionally protected activities.

> * Strong rhetoric denouncing “resistance” rhetoric and connecting it to terrorism risks alienating segments of the electorate concerned about free expression or critical of U.S. Middle East policy.
