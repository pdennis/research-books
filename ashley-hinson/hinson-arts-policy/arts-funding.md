**May 2021: Ashley Hinson Raised Concerns About Future Of Federal Historic Tax Credits Under American Jobs Plan** According to Telegraph Herald, "Hinson voiced some concern for the fate of federal historic tax credits if President Joe Biden's $2.2 trillion American Jobs Plan is pursued. 'We're standing in a building where there were historic tax credits used,' she said. 'Is that something that's going to have to give because they want to spend in other areas? We don't have an unlimited spending spigot.'"
