# Engagement with Labor Organizations and Constituents

### Summary

> * In October 2021, Ashley Hinson expressed hope for a positive resolution during the John Deere worker strike, affirming workers’ rights to legally negotiate with employers ([Journal-Eureka, 10/21/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:63WV-R8G1-JBCN-40M5-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * In 2017, Hinson described a union-related email as "petty bullying" and "misogynistic," and used the incident to argue for reforms in Iowa’s collective bargaining process ([Des Moines Register, 2/11/17](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5MVJ-38J1-DYJJ-P011-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Hinson insisted on receiving respect equal to her peers, referencing gender and status as a rationale for demanding an apology from union affiliates ([Des Moines Register, 2/11/17](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5MVJ-38J1-DYJJ-P011-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * In March 2021, Hinson wore a mask expressing distrust of teachers unions, which was criticized as disrespectful by education constituents; she defended the action as support for in-person schooling ([Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier, 2/17/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:64TF-0131-JBCN-44GY-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Potential vulnerability: Hinson’s public criticism of unions and symbolic gestures, such as the mask, have been viewed as antagonistic by some union members and educators, possibly straining relationships with labor organizations.

**2017: Hinson Responded To Union Email As 'Petty Bullying' And 'Misogynistic'** According to Des Moines Register, "Hinson told The Des Moines Register she considers Schmidt's email to be 'petty bullying.' The fact it was circulated among Des Moines Public Schools employees serves as evidence of the need for reform in Iowa's collective bargaining process, she said. [...] 'I find this to be offensive and I think it is misogynistic and hypocritical,' Hinson said. 'You know, I am a smart woman. I am an elected representative. I deserve respect like any other representative on that list, or among my peers,' Hinson said. She suggested that she is owed an apology."

**March 2021: Hinson Wore Mask Criticizing Teachers Unions** According to Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier, 'A retired teacher, said she found it "very disrespectful" that Hinson, along with other House Republicans, wore masks last March saying they didn't trust teachers unions. "Many students in this country didn't have the option to be in school in person," Hinson said, noting her mask was in support of that.'
