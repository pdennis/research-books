# Childhood Interests and Activities

### Early Community Involvement

**2016: Wayne Kreutner Claimed Ashley Hinson Was Active in Community and Civic Organizations** According to a letter to the editor published in Gazette (Cedar Rapids, IA), "She is involved in many community building events, active in church and civic organizations and frequently is out talking to people to learn of their concerns and how she can help them." [Letter to the Editor - Gazette (Cedar Rapids, IA), [10/19/16](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5MK2-KR71-F0NV-F2CC-00000-00&context=1519360)]



### Hobbies and Passions

**February 2024: Hinson Described Her Career Path To Congress As Indirect** According to Globe Gazette, "Hinson said serving in Congress 'was not on [her] bingo card,' and she came to public service circuitously. She is an accomplished musician, a trait she shares with her sons. 'I play a mean national anthem,' she joked with audience members."
