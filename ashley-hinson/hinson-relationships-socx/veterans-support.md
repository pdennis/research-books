# Support for Veterans and Special Interest Groups

### Veteran Support Initiatives

**Ashley Hinson Aided In Securing Military Medals For Vietnam Veteran Klug In 2022** According to Gazette, "That changed when members of his family and Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, got involved. [...] Kissling credited Hinson's office for helping to bring it all together. 'Ashley Hinson's office found that he still hasn't got this medal, and they did a lot of back work to make this happen,' Kissling said. 'I've heard that they had to do a lot of digging in a warehouse for the medals because it's not something they are really giving out anymore.'"
