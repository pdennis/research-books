# Stance on International Trade and Economic Policy

### Summary

> * Hinson’s evolving stance on tariffs—opposing them as a first-line tool in earlier years but defending their use by the Trump administration—could be seen as inconsistent or politically motivated ([Gazette, 1/16/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DXB-BGT3-RV2J-S3CN-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Emphasis on cracking down on Chinese trade violations may expose Hinson to criticism for focusing heavily on punitive actions rather than a broad, proactive trade strategy ([Daily Nonpareil, 12/6/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DKK-YY11-JBCN-34WN-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Advocacy for free trade and removal of trade barriers contrasts with support for tariffs and trade enforcement measures, possibly indicating mixed messaging ([OnTheIssues.org, 2/6/23](https://ontheissues.org/House/Ashley_Hinson_Free_Trade.htm#20PVS-13)).
> * Staunch support for USMCA and pressure on Democrats over trade agreements could open Hinson to charges of partisanship or using trade policy for political gain ([Gazette, 8/1/19](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5WPW-4CM1-DXVP-V46V-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Expressing concern about tariffs’ impact on Iowa farmers while supporting their use as leverage may alienate both agricultural interests worried about trade wars and voters who favor strong action against foreign competitors ([Des Moines Register, 3/17/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FBW-RF13-RS01-R36M-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Calls for stricter scrutiny and enforcement against China risk being perceived as too confrontational, possibly threatening important export markets for Iowa producers ([Manchester Press, 8/30/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:692D-WDN1-DXVP-T250-00000-00&context=1519360)).
