# Positions on U.S. National Security and Defense

### Summary

> * Ashley Hinson consistently supported robust U.S. global engagement, describing America as a “beacon of hope and strength” and advocating an “America first, not America alone” approach ([Iowa Torch](https://iowatorch.com/2022/09/11/hinson-americas-light-will-never-be-dimmed/), [Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D7J-BH31-JBCN-341W-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Hinson has backed significant military and foreign aid packages, notably voting for the $95 billion 2024 package for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, while emphasizing the need for strict oversight, anti-corruption measures, and accountability for U.S. aid ([Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BX6-YNW1-JBCN-3507-00000-00&context=1519360), [Daily Nonpareil](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BWM-BXH1-JBCN-326B-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * After fact-finding missions to Ukraine and meetings with U.S. and Ukrainian officials, Hinson became more convinced of U.S. national interests in arming Ukraine, but insisted that aid packages require close monitoring and proper strategy ([Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BX7-FGG1-JBCN-33TW-00000-00&context=1519360), [Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BWT-H521-DXVP-T0DH-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * On Israel, Hinson has firmly supported U.S. military aid, called for the eradication of Hamas, worked to help Iowans and hostages affected by conflict, and advocated for stronger sanctions against Iran ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CMM-NF61-DYWP-8003-00000-00&context=1519360), [Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69JG-M0Y1-JBCN-31BV-00000-00&context=1519360), [The Daily Nonpareil](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BKH-0PV1-JBCN-316X-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Hinson has advocated for a tougher U.S. stance on China, focusing on countering trade malpractices, agricultural technology theft, and Chinese land purchases in the U.S., including co-introducing legislation for a DOJ task force on trade crimes and serving on the House China Select Committee ([Sioux City Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DKT-XYH1-DXVP-T44M-00000-00&context=1519360), [Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67BW-X4J1-DXVP-V455-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Potential vulnerability: Some critics—including within her party—have challenged Hinson’s support for large foreign aid packages, especially when not paired with U.S. border security measures, and there is ongoing debate about the effectiveness and public perception of these expenditures ([Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D09-BK11-JBCN-33V0-00000-00&context=1519360), [Daily Nonpareil](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D0B-5H91-DXVP-T1BN-00000-00&context=1519360)).
