# Immigration, Humanitarian, and Global Health Policy

### Summary

> * Ashley Hinson emphasized a "zero tolerance" policy by the State Department regarding violations of student visas, stressing the importance of following U.S. laws while encouraging international students to study and conduct research in the U.S. ([Waterloo Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FN0-0173-RTVN-X2MW-00000-00&context=1519360), [Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMX-GRB3-RW48-631P-00000-00&context=1519360))
> * Hinson’s statements signal support for lawful immigration, coupled with strict enforcement to deter visa abuse.
> * In March 2024, protesters called on Hinson to advocate for a Gaza ceasefire, the release of captives, and an end to Israel’s military occupation of Palestinian territories, pressing her to use her influence for humanitarian measures ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BKH-0PV1-JBCN-316X-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * The focus on strict visa enforcement may raise concerns about over-enforcement or unjust revocations affecting students who contribute to U.S. education and research.
> * Public demands for stronger humanitarian action suggest potential vulnerability for Hinson among constituents seeking a more active stance on global health and human rights issues.
