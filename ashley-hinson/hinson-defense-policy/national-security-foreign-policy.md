# National Security and Foreign Policy

### Summary

> * Ashley Hinson endorsed Pete Hegseth as a "strong pick" for Defense Secretary in December 2024, praising his intent to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives from the military and cut Pentagon bureaucracy ([Gazette, 12/7/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DKT-HGR1-JBCN-3526-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Hinson has consistently supported strengthening national security, including advocating for restarting border wall construction and backing the military and law enforcement, according to earlier statements and public endorsements ([Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier, 6/7/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65MN-MM21-JBCN-44C0-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * In 2023, she called for accelerating U.S. military aid to Taiwan, emphasizing the importance of honoring commitments to international partners and maintaining discussions with the Biden administration to expedite support ([Manchester Press, 4/12/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:680J-YRK1-DXVP-T54G-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Her national security stance signals an alignment with more hardline, anti-DEI policies in the military and a willingness to support disruptive change at the Pentagon.
> * Hinson’s strong positions could be viewed as politically polarizing, especially regarding opposition to DEI and border policy, potentially making her vulnerable to criticism from those favoring more inclusive or diplomatic approaches.
