### Concerns about program funding tradeoffs

**December 2022: Hinson Objected To Funding For Gender Equity Programs And Student Loan Outreach** According to Globe Gazette, "Hinson also pointed to funding for gender equity programs as well as $2.3 million for the U.S. Department of Education to contact student loan borrowers to let them know they may qualify for cancellation of student loan debt and to encourage borrowers to enroll in a qualifying repayment plan. 'These are not appropriate or acceptable uses of taxpayer dollars,' Hinson wrote in her weekly congressional newsletter."
