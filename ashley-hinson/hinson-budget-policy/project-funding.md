# Project Funding and Community Investments

### Summary

> * Ashley Hinson opposed the federal infrastructure bill, citing concerns about social spending and inflation, but still sought to secure infrastructure funding for Iowa after its passage ([Gazette, 10/9/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66K9-5D31-DXVP-V07K-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Hinson voiced opposition to federal funding for gender equity initiatives and for student loan cancellation notification programs ([Gazette, 12/23/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6759-4S61-DXVP-V42R-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Despite voting against the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill, Hinson secured nearly $28 million in earmarked funding for 13 community projects in her district, including airport, infrastructure, and flood mitigation projects ([Globe Gazette, 12/24/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:675B-SMT1-DXVP-V0NX-00000-00&context=1519360); [Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier, 12/24/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6759-YP31-DXVP-V3TH-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * The funded projects included support for Habitat for Humanity, emergency services, road and airport improvements, wastewater upgrades, and flood control across Eastern Iowa ([Globe Gazette, 12/24/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:675B-SMT1-DXVP-V0NX-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * A potential vulnerability is Hinson’s pattern of opposing major federal spending bills while simultaneously championing and claiming credit for the local projects funded by those very bills.
