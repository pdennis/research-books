# Budget Reform and Appropriations

### Summary

> * Hinson repeatedly opposed federal spending bills, citing concerns about "wasteful spending" and inadequate border security, which could be criticized as obstructionist during negotiations ([Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:675B-SMT1-DXVP-V0NX-00000-00&context=1519360); [Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6759-4S61-DXVP-V42R-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * She emphasized being excluded from bipartisan negotiations, potentially signaling limited ability to collaborate or influence legislative outcomes ([Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6759-YP31-DXVP-V3TH-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Her opposition was largely framed in partisan terms, suggesting she might prioritize party alignment over compromise or pragmatic solutions ([Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:675B-SMT1-DXVP-V0NX-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Consistent references to border security and taxpayer respect may alienate constituents who prioritize other local or national issues ([Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6759-4S61-DXVP-V42R-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * By highlighting procedural complaints (lack of Republican inclusion), Hinson could be perceived as focused more on party process than legislative outcomes ([Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6759-YP31-DXVP-V3TH-00000-00&context=1519360)).
