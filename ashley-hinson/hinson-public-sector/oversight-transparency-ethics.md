> * The ethics complaint specifically alleged Hinson used official channels to lobby the public against a Democrat-led election result challenge, potentially violating rules about separating official and campaign activities ([Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:61T5-NGF1-DXVP-V3CM-00000-00&context=1519360)).
