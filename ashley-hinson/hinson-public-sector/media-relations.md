# Media Relations and Public Communication

### Summary

> * Hinson has been criticized in local media for using divisive language in communications with constituents, despite public claims of promoting unity ([Gazette Letter to the Editor, 1/22/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:61V1-J201-JBCN-44K6-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Repeated use of “socialism” to attack Democrats has been called out as disingenuous given widespread Iowan support for programs like Social Security and Medicare ([Gazette Letter to the Editor, 1/22/21](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:61V1-J201-JBCN-44K6-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Public remarks and messaging risk alienating moderate voters by reinforcing partisan divides.
> * Hinson’s team has dismissed significant national issues (such as the Jan. 6 Committee) as media “obsession,” which could be perceived as out of touch with voter concerns about democracy and accountability ([Gazette, 12/19/22](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:674G-3061-DXVP-V3CT-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * These communication choices provide opponents with opportunities to question Hinson’s authenticity and commitment to bipartisan cooperation.
