**Ashley Hinson And Liz Mathis Previously Worked As Television News Anchors In Iowa** According to Gazette (Cedar Rapids, IA), "Mathis will challenge first-term Republican Rep. Ashley Hinson, who is seeking reelection in what now is the 20-county 1st District. [...] Mathis, 63, said she will draw on her experience not only as a television reporter and anchor for 27 years at KWWL-TV and KCRG-TV — both of which cover the 1st District market — but from what she has learned as a children's advocate, wife, mother, caregiver and legislator since 2011. [...] In addition to their time working together at KCRG where Mathis was an evening news anchor while Hinson was a morning news anchor, the candidates' connection continued at the Iowa Legislature where Hinson served two terms, representing a House district that was one half of Mathis' Senate District."

**2022: Ashley Hinson Emphasized Her Background In Flood Reporting To Justify Flood Mitigation Requests** According to Globe Gazette, "Referring to her previous career in television news, Hinson said that as someone 'who has been out there, knee-deep in dirty water, covering floods,' she said she knows that investing in Linn County flood mitigation and the UI Flood Center will pay dividends to taxpayers, communities, businesses and homeowners."
