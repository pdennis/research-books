# Positions on Law Enforcement, Justice Reform, and Civil Liberties

### Summary

> * Hinson expressed reluctance over a federal investigation into the Anamosa prison incident, potentially opening her to criticism for insufficient oversight or accountability ([Radio Iowa](https://www.radioiowa.com/2021/04/23/congresswoman-hinson-discusses-dc-statehood-vaccinations/)).
> * She voiced strong confidence in state-led investigations, which may be perceived as downplaying independent or federal review in serious matters ([Radio Iowa](https://www.radioiowa.com/2021/04/23/congresswoman-hinson-discusses-dc-statehood-vaccinations/)).
> * Hinson's statements at a 2025 town hall suggested a willingness to limit due process for pending immigration cases, which led to public backlash and could be exploited as a weakness on civil liberties ([Sioux City Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FN7-RXH3-S5PB-S145-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Her repeated claims that the justice system is being politicized under President Biden, particularly regarding charges against Donald Trump, open her up to accusations of partisanship and undermining trust in the legal process ([Muscatine Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68WJ-1NT1-JBCN-31J5-00000-00&context=1519360), [Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68WM-PXN1-DXVP-T51H-00000-00&context=1519360), [Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68WJ-1NT1-JBCN-312H-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Although she supported accountability for January 6th offenders, this stance could alienate some within her own party's base who view the prosecutions differently ([Iowa Starting Line](https://iowastartingline.com/2022/04/21/hinson-talks-jan-6-russia-social-security-elections-at-town-halls/)).
