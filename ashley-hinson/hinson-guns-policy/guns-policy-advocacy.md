# Guns Policy Priorities and Advocacy

### Summary

> * Ashley Hinson has consistently voiced strong support for law-abiding gun owners and has repeatedly opposed "sweeping" or broad federal firearm regulations proposed by the Biden-Harris administration ([Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CSS-H791-DXVP-T06M-00000-00&context=1519360), [Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CSS-XW01-JBCN-31T9-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Hinson backs legislation to prevent the use of public health emergencies as a means to enact new federal gun control measures ([Daily Nonpareil](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CSS-XW01-JBCN-30T8-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * She frequently frames her position as a defense of Second Amendment rights and argues that gun control proposals unfairly "demonize" legal gun owners ([Des Moines Register](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66JN-RPG1-JB1V-G0F3-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Hinson emphasizes mental health and school safety, rather than stricter gun laws, as key solutions to address gun violence ([Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6G-X7Y1-JBCN-349J-00000-00&context=1519360), [Manchester Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:680J-YRK1-DXVP-T54G-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Letters to the editor reveal some constituents perceive a vulnerability in Hinson’s approach, critiquing her focus on post-tragedy rapid response and urging support for "common sense" gun laws and increased mental health funding ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B4M-JWB1-DYWP-80J2-00000-00&context=1519360)).
