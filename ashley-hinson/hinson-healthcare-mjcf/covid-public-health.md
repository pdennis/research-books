**2021: Letter Writer Norman Sherman Reported Ashley Hinson Opposed Using Federal Coronavirus Funds for Prisoner Medical Care** According to a letter to the editor published in Gazette (Cedar Rapids, IA), "In a bizarre appeal to her audience, she deplored spending any of the $700 million of federal coronavirus dollars at prisons where some convicted, despicable people get the same medical treatment that other prisoners get. She cites a killer and a sexual abuser of young women as people who should apparently be denied available care."
