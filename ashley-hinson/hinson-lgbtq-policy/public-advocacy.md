**2020: Ashley Hinson Stated Support for LGBTQ Rights in Campaign Interview** According to a letter to the editor published in Gazette (Cedar Rapids, IA), "In a 2020 interview, when Hinson was asked why the LGBTQ community should support her candidacy, she responded, 'I support the LGBTQ community and support everyone's rights as human beings. No person should be discriminated against, no person should be bullied because of who they are, and no person should be discriminated against in the workplace, for any reason.'"
