# Civil Liberties, Government Authority, and Voting Rights

### Summary

> * Ashley Hinson expressed strong support for states' rights in administering elections, repeatedly opposing federal election reform bills such as the For the People Act (HR 1) and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, emphasizing her belief that the Constitution delegates control of elections to the states ([Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:63SF-KNW1-DXVP-V4SF-00000-00&context=1519360), [Valley News Today](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:63SN-M1J1-JBCN-40TC-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * She consistently promoted confidence in Iowa’s election integrity, assuring constituents that Iowa’s election system works and that their votes are secure, while also acknowledging that some constituents have concerns about election integrity ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6439-PPW1-JCDM-J05M-00000-00&context=1519360), [Iowa Starting Line](https://iowastartingline.com/2022/04/21/hinson-talks-jan-6-russia-social-security-elections-at-town-halls/)).
> 
> * Hinson publicly condemned the violence during the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, called for President Trump to denounce the violence, and affirmed her commitment to the Constitution and a peaceful democratic process ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:61PS-TGK1-JCDM-J0VB-00000-00&context=1519360), [Daily Nonpareil](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:61PN-NF81-JBCN-44B0-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * While she initially called for certification of the Electoral College confirming Biden as president, she also voted to block certification of some 2020 election results before ultimately accepting Biden's victory and stating she would certify future election results, regardless of outcome ([OnTheIssues.org](https://www.ontheissues.org/House/Ashley_Hinson_Principles_+_Values.htm), [Des Moines Register](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D6G-5R31-DXGX-64NJ-00000-00&context=1519360)). This creates a potential vulnerability regarding her consistency on election certification.
> 
> * Hinson has emphasized her support for the First Amendment and press freedom, but has also supported calls to investigate and restrict coordinated pro-Hamas activities, stating that such actions—which endanger or intimidate others—fall outside the bounds of protected free speech ([Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69GS-VN11-JBCN-32NG-00000-00&context=1519360), [Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CMX-5C61-JBCN-31CC-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Critics and letter writers have accused Hinson of voting against police brutality accountability and protections for voting rights, pointing to her votes and public statements as evidence ([Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:63FG-2D71-JBCN-43J4-00000-00&context=1519360), [Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:642P-M7T1-DXVP-V157-00000-00&context=1519360)).
