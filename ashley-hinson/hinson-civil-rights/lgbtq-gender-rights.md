# LGBTQ+ Rights and Gender Issues

### Summary

> * Consistent opposition to transgender student protections could alienate moderate voters and LGBTQ+ allies, as Hinson repeatedly targeted school policies that protected trans students' privacy and rights (e.g., [Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/parental-rights-becomes-focus-at-ashley-hinson-rally/), [Iowa Starting Line](https://iowastartingline.com/2023/09/28/how-ashley-hinson-made-her-kids-school-public-enemy-no-1/)).
> * Framing local school issues as "culture wars" and engaging in high-profile opposition, such as aligning with Mike Pence and giving exclusive interviews to right-wing media, could be seen as divisive political theater rather than issue-solving ([Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/parental-rights-becomes-focus-at-ashley-hinson-rally/), [Iowa Starting Line](https://iowastartingline.com/2023/09/28/how-ashley-hinson-made-her-kids-school-public-enemy-no-1/)).
> * Frequent public support for laws banning transgender athletes and praise for blocking federal efforts to expand LGBTQ+ rights risks backlash from younger voters and civil rights groups ([Des Moines Register](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/24/iowa-rep-ashley-hinson-town-hall-defends-donald-trump-agenda-mason-city/83229133007/), [Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C59-9HN1-JBCN-341H-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Using parental rights as a campaign centerpiece and repeatedly linking transgender rights to parental authority may be viewed as exclusionary or intolerant, especially among voters concerned with anti-discrimination ([Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/parental-rights-becomes-focus-at-ashley-hinson-rally/), [Muscatine Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69DW-XVF1-DXVP-T2SK-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Hinson's comments and actions have led to criticism for targeting vulnerable students to gain political capital, potentially damaging her appeal among independents and swing voters ([Gazette Letter](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66CR-XPT1-JBCN-444M-00000-00&context=1519360), [Gazette Editorial](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66NV-TJS1-DXVP-V0KD-00000-00&context=1519360)).
