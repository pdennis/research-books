# Health Policy Reform and Accountability

### Summary

> * Ashley Hinson consistently advocates for targeted reforms to the health care system, such as increased transparency in prescription drug pricing, administrative simplification, and expanded access to telemedicine, rather than large-scale government interventions like "Medicare for All" or broad price controls. [The Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/guest-columnists/hinson-pro-family-policies-and-less-government/), [Mitchell County Press-News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:615P-7C61-JBCN-42MK-00000-00&context=1519360)
> * She has opposed federal legislation to cap the cost of insulin, arguing it would raise premiums and set a dangerous precedent for government price-setting, instead supporting alternative bipartisan measures capping out-of-pocket costs for seniors and improving patient transparency. [Radio Iowa](https://www.radioiowa.com/2022/04/01/hinson-explains-vote-against-insulin-bill-in-u-s-house/), [Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CRV-JYN1-JBCN-33F7-00000-00&context=1519360)
> * Hinson has prioritized funding and legislative support for mental health care, rural hospital modernization, and oversight of opioid settlement funds—frequently emphasizing bipartisan cooperation and targeted investment. [Daily Nonpareil](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B61-6KM1-JBCN-30K9-00000-00&context=1519360), [Sioux City Journal](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C29-R3Y1-JBCN-3123-00000-00&context=1519360)
> * She routinely expresses that every American does not necessarily want or need government-provided health insurance, believes the Affordable Care Act did not sufficiently lower premiums, and supports reforms that ensure coverage for people with pre-existing conditions while opposing full ACA repeal without such protections. [Quad-City Times](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6111-BSF1-DXVP-V4FP-00000-00&context=1519360), [Des Moines Register](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60T1-VFG1-DYJJ-P0YV-00000-00&context=1519360)
> * Hinson's voting record and public statements have drawn criticism from opponents and some advocacy groups, who argue she has opposed measures to broaden access or lower costs, such as voting against insulin caps, the Infant Formula Appropriations Act, and for supporting non-ACA compliant health insurance options. [Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6555-FWG1-DYWP-80S7-00000-00&context=1519360), [Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:657J-C681-DXVP-V4XY-00000-00&context=1519360)
> * Potential vulnerabilities include past accusations of supporting Medicaid cuts, refusing to fix Medicaid privatization problems, and a perceived reluctance to firmly state her stance on major health policy lawsuits or the Affordable Care Act.
