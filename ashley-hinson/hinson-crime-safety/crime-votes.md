# Legislative Positions and Votes on Crime Issues

### Summary

> * Hinson voted against the creation of an Active Shooter Alert System, a move opponents could frame as opposing commonsense public safety measures ([Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65S9-YGS1-DXVP-V0RT-00000-00), [Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65S8-9KJ1-DXVP-V229-00000-00)).
> * She faced criticism for voting against increased accountability in cases of police brutality, which could be perceived as opposing police reform efforts ([Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:63FG-2D71-JBCN-43J4-00000-00)).
> * Hinson's opposition to the shooter alert bill was justified by concerns about panic and law enforcement burden, but may be portrayed as failing to prioritize quick responses to violent emergencies ([Globe Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65S9-YGS1-DXVP-V0RT-00000-00), [Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65S8-9KJ1-DXVP-V229-00000-00)).
> * Despite supporting programs for crime victims, law enforcement, and youth violence prevention, Hinson's record shows selective support, which could be depicted as inconsistent or reactive rather than comprehensive ([Telegraph Herald](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66ST-7GN1-DYWP-8062-00000-00), [Manchester Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69CC-N7G1-JBCN-30J5-00000-00)).
> * Her recent focus on proper use of opioid settlement funds highlights potential vulnerabilities if such funds are misused in Iowa, or if oversight efforts are seen as performative rather than substantive ([The Gazette](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B6V-8941-JBCN-304F-00000-00)).
