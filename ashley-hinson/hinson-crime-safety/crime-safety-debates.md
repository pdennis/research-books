> * She has prioritized school safety by co-sponsoring and supporting the STOP II Act (Secure Every School and Protect our Nation's Children Act), which funds school resource officers, mental health counselors, enhanced school security, and improved coordination between schools and law enforcement ([Gazette, 2022](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:65S8-9KJ1-DXVP-V229-00000-00&context=1519360); [Des Moines Register, 2022](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66JN-RPG1-JB1V-G0F3-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * In the aftermath of the Perry High School shooting, Hinson condemned the perpetrator in strong terms but was criticized by some constituents for not providing concrete preventive solutions and focusing on rapid response rather than prevention ([Manchester Press, 2024](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B48-YSV1-DXVP-T1CX-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Hinson has highlighted a dramatic increase in cartel-related drug activity in Iowa since 2021, citing rises in fentanyl seizures and stressing the need for stricter border security and anti-drug trafficking measures ([Gazette, 2021](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:62S1-VR51-JBCN-4211-00000-00&context=1519360); [Des Moines Register, 2024](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DC5-P5C1-DXGX-61F4-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Potential vulnerabilities exist in perceptions that Hinson’s approach to public safety emphasizes punishment and post-crisis response rather than proactive prevention and comprehensive solutions to broader issues such as gun violence ([Telegraph Herald, 2024](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6B4M-JWB1-DYWP-80J2-00000-00&context=1519360)).
