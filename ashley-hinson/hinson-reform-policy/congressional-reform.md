### Summary

### Oversight of Legislative Processes

"So I'm hopeful we can take a look at that and make sure that this kind of breakdown in process doesn't happen again, because I can certainly tell you Matt Gaetz isn't the one suffering right now. It's the people of this district who are worried about the uncertain times ahead for Congress."' [Muscatine Journal (Iowa), [10/6/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69BB-8S01-DXVP-T25C-00000-00&context=1519360)]

'We have a lot to do in the coming weeks before that deadline (to avert a government shutdown after government funding runs out) on Nov. 17.

We need to get back to work for the American people.'"
