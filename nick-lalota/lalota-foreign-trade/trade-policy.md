# International Trade Policy

### Summary

> * Heavy focus on tariffs and trade deficit reduction with China may risk retaliation or trade wars, potentially harming American exporters ([Oyster Bay Guardian](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FH3-HNB3-RSD3-70KN-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Emphasizing "competitive fairness" for American manufacturers could be criticized as protectionist, which may alienate international allies and partners ([Massapequa Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FGW-WGP3-RSP4-44HD-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Messaging centers almost exclusively on deficits with China, overlooking other key trading partners where similar issues may arise ([Amityville Record](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FGW-WGP3-RSP4-44PG-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Stated reliance on broad tariffs may raise costs for American consumers and industries dependent on imported goods ([Babylon Beacon](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FGW-WGP3-RSP4-44RH-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Repetitive public statements risk being perceived as lacking depth or nuanced trade policy, making it difficult to address complex global trade dynamics.
