# Foreign Policy Positions

### Summary

> * Nick LaLota has consistently criticized President Biden’s foreign policy, describing it as weak on border security and emboldening adversaries like Russia, China, and Iran, while touting Trump’s policies as beneficial for national strength ([East Hampton Star](https://www.easthamptonstar.com/government/2024122/lalota-lines-behind-trump)).
> * He is a strong supporter of Israel, especially in the aftermath of the October 7 Hamas attack, asserting unconditional backing for Israel’s right to self-defense and equating Israel’s fight against Hamas to the U.S. fight against terrorism ([Long Island Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69P9-S7R1-JBCN-34XW-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * LaLota advocates for a tough stance on Iran, emphasizing the need to confront Iranian influence and its use of proxy groups like Hamas ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D7R-C931-JBKF-V533-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * On Ukraine, LaLota supports aid but calls for strong oversight and auditing to ensure proper use of U.S. taxpayer funds ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67P7-05K1-JBKF-V2D3-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * He has taken active steps to support Americans detained abroad, including advocating for the release of Kai Li from China, meeting with him post-release, and co-sponsoring bipartisan legislation to aid wrongfully detained Americans ([Newsday Online](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FPF-KSJ3-RRJ4-20B9-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * A potential vulnerability lies in LaLota’s party-line stance on immigration, which could be viewed as lacking nuance, and his criticism of bipartisan immigration reforms as “weak” ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D85-9T61-JBKF-V15P-00000-00&context=1519360)).

Those who chant Death to America are the same ones who want to wipe Israel off the map. And it's that bond that ensures that the United States of America will always stand with Israel. What happened in Israel on Oct. 7 was wrong, Hamas is wrong, and Israel is right. Israel absolutely has not only the right to exist, but to defend herself and also to pursue those who committed those atrocities against her without any conditions whatsoever.'"
