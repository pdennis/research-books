# Military Funding and Readiness

### Summary

> * Rep. Nick LaLota has consistently advocated for safeguarding military funding and readiness, urging Congress to pass the NDAA without controversial amendments that could risk military effectiveness or readiness ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ndaa-defense-authorization-bill-house-amendments/), 7/13/23).
> * In April 2025, LaLota objected to the cancellation of a Navy research grant for Stony Brook University, arguing the project enhances the Navy's submarine force by increasing stealth and lethality ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FP7-T693-RW0W-74NK-00000-00&context=1519360), 4/30/25; [Newsday Online](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FP7-MM53-SBM3-83G7-00000-00&context=1519360), 4/30/25).
> * LaLota communicated directly with the Department of Defense and Defense Secretary, urging prompt reinstatement of the grant, and noted that the agency was considering his request ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FP7-T693-RW0W-74NK-00000-00&context=1519360), [Newsday Online](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FP7-MM53-SBM3-83G7-00000-00&context=1519360), 4/30/25).
> * While LaLota stated support for eliminating truly wasteful spending, he maintained that the Stony Brook grant aligns with both fiscal responsibility and national security priorities ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FP7-T693-RW0W-74NK-00000-00&context=1519360), 4/30/25).
> * A potential vulnerability exists if critical defense projects like the Navy grant are defunded without careful review, risking negative impacts on military capabilities and readiness.

**July 2023: Rep. Nick LaLota Urged Separation Of Controversial Amendments From NDAA** According to CBS News, "Republican Rep. Nick LaLota, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said the amendments should be separate from the defense bill. 'Congress must pass the NDAA,' LaLota tweeted Thursday. 'The amendments which would cause the NDAA to fail put our military's lethality at risk and should be debated outside of the NDAA. We cannot play games with our soldiers' lives, pay, or military readiness.'" [CBS News, [7/13/23](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ndaa-defense-authorization-bill-house-amendments/)]
