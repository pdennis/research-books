**July 2024: LaLota Commented On Biden's Mental And Physical Health** According to Long Island Press, "'After 50 years of service and a very challenging last few years that have clearly taken a toll on him mentally and physically, it's heartening to see that President Biden and his family are finally acknowledging his prolonged mental decline,' LaLota said. 'Prioritizing his health is essential, and I am glad they are taking steps in this direction.'"

**Nick LaLota Dismissed The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 As Not Worth Commenting On In October 2024** According to Statesman: SUNY, Stony Brook, 'An attendee asked LaLota about his thoughts on Project 2025, a proposal from The Heritage Foundation that promotes conservative and right-wing policies. "Respectfully, it's not even worth a comment because it isn't a real document. No one has even read it," Lalota responded.'
