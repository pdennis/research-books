**May 2024: LaLota Accused Bragg Of Political Prosecution And Urged Hochul To Pardon Trump** According to City & State (New York), "Republican Rep. Nick LaLota, who represents the NY-1 swing district on Long Island, accused Bragg of engaging in a political prosecution and even called on Gov. Kathy Hochul to pardon Trump.

To not do so is to allow America to become a banana republic,' he wrote in a post on X."
