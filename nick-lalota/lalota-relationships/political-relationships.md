# Relationships with Political Figures and Institutions

### Summary

> * LaLota’s early and vocal endorsement of Donald Trump in a Biden-won district exposed him to criticism of being too deferential to Trump and “ultra-partisan,” including for defending Trump amid controversial statements and failing to condemn extremism ([Associated Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C9P-4R21-JC5B-G0G4-00000-00), [City & State](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D4K-3PR1-DXVP-T226-00000-00), [Daily Voice](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DHC-GB11-JBCN-32NC-00000-00)).
> 
> * He has faced strong and public criticism from prominent Republicans (e.g., Adam Kinzinger) and Democratic opponents (e.g., John Avlon) for not explicitly condemning Trump’s reported praise of Hitler and other forms of extremism ([Bedford Daily Voice](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DHC-GB01-DXVP-T0BW-00000-00), [Chappaqua Daily Voice](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DHC-GB11-JBCN-3182-00000-00)).
> 
> * LaLota was often publicly attacked by and drawn into feuds with George Santos, who accused him of being a “RINO” and “empty suit,” and whose controversial candidacies repeatedly threatened to siphon support from LaLota among right-wing voters ([Daily Beast](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BTD-VMN1-JBHT-D1C4-00000-00), [Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BTF-8261-JBM5-R06C-00000-00)).
> 
> * Democratic campaigns and local police unions have questioned or refused to back LaLota, instead favoring his opponents and arguing he is “a danger to law enforcement and public safety” ([Daily News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66RB-F4Y1-DY37-F1N4-00000-00)).
> 
> * In his 2024 race against John Avlon, LaLota’s focus on Avlon’s residency and “elitist” background risks backlash for negative campaigning, while accusations of political carpetbagging could appear hypocritical according to some narratives ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/nyregion/ny-voter-guide-house-races.html), [Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D61-KX11-DY2H-J0MJ-00000-00)).
