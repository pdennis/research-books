# Engagement with Media and Public Forums

### Summary

> * Nick LaLota’s public profile and campaign finance details are available through [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Nicholas_J._LaLota) and [Follow the Money](https://www.followthemoney.org/entity-details?eid=&default=candidate), as referenced by BillTrack50 [(source)](https://www.billtrack50.com/legislatordetail/27928).
> * In early 2023, LaLota’s office received misdirected constituent calls, possibly due to changes in office assignments following redistricting [(Newsday, 1/20/23)](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:67C2-7721-JBKF-V3PY-00000-00&context=1519360).
> * In October 2024, LaLota did not respond to numerous media requests from multiple outlets for comment regarding reports on Donald Trump’s reported Hitler-related remarks, reflecting limited engagement with these inquiries (see [Cortlandt Daily Voice](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DHC-GB11-JBCN-320W-00000-00&context=1519360), [Chappaqua Daily Voice](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DHC-GB11-JBCN-3182-00000-00&context=1519360), and others).
> * LaLota was also unreachable for comment on the challenge against George Santos in March 2024, as reported by [Oyster Bay Guardian](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6BK0-RXF1-JBCN-30NM-00000-00&context=1519360), suggesting a broader pattern of non-responsiveness to media inquiries.
> * LaLota has actively used social media in his campaign, recently highlighting his opponent John Avlon’s Manhattan residency to frame Avlon as out of touch, as covered by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/nyregion/avlon-lalota-residency-congress.html).
> * Potential vulnerability: LaLota’s repeated lack of response to media outlets on high-profile topics may expose him to criticism for limited transparency and public accountability.
