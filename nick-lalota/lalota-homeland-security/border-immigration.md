### Securing U.S. Borders

**LaLota Cited Public Safety And Border Security As Top Priorities** According to Dans Papers, “Public safety is a basic necessity,” he says. “All Long Islanders should have a reasonable expectation of living in a safe neighborhood, which is why we must work with, support and respect the role of law enforcement so they can most effectively serve and protect our communities. We need to talk about our border when discussing public safety, because the porous border is the root of many public safety issues we are facing; the open border is a national security issue and it must be closed before we can reasonably tackle the immigration, human trafficking and drug crises.” [Dans Papers, [1/8/23](https://www.danspapers.com/2023/01/nick-lalota-profile-congress/)]
