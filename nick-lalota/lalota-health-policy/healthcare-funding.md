'While budget cuts are necessary, we must tread carefully to avoid jeopardizing essential services, as was the case with recent NIH funding reductions,' LaLota said. 'I am especially committed to reversing these cuts. Moreover, I urge my Democratic colleagues to clarify which spending cuts, if any, they are willing to support.'"

This week, he led a group of New York and New Jersey Republican representatives, including LaLota, in writing a letter to Trump expressing what they called 'grave concerns' regarding the program staff and research cuts. They rightly suggest 'fencing off' the program from 'any further staff and funding reductions.'"
