# Medicare and Local Impact in New York-1

### Summary

> * Rep. Nick LaLota’s claim that no constituents have reported issues with Social Security access in the last two months could be seen as dismissive of potential underreported struggles among seniors ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMJ-1KT3-RVKB-G001-00000-00&context=1519360), [Newsday Online](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMR-V5B3-RRH2-V53S-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * LaLota publicly accused Democratic rival Tom Suozzi of needlessly alarming seniors about Social Security, exposing both to criticism for politicizing senior benefits ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMJ-1KT3-RVKB-G001-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * The emphasis on there being “no problems” may backfire if constituents later report difficulties, making LaLota appear out of touch or unresponsive ([Newsday Online](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMR-V5B3-RRH2-V53S-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Rejecting concerns about Medicare and Social Security as “partisan” risks alienating seniors who feel uncertain or dissatisfied with government service access ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FMJ-1KT3-RVKB-G001-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * The back-and-forth accusations between LaLota and Suozzi can increase voter perception of polarization, instead of reassuring seniors about the security of their benefits.
