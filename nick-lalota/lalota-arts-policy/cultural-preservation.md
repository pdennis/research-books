# Approach to Cultural Preservation and Humanities Initiatives

### Summary

> * Rep. Nick LaLota urged President Biden in May 2023 to designate Plum Island as a national monument, citing the Antiquities Act of 1906 as the authority for such action ([Newsday, 5/28/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68BB-TFW1-DY2H-J43S-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * LaLota argued that national monument status would safeguard both the island's natural habitat—which supports rare and endangered species—and its cultural heritage, including its significance to Native American history ([Newsday, 5/28/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68BB-TFW1-DY2H-J43S-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * He stated that national monument designation could be accomplished in 12 to 24 months, offering a faster route than seeking national park status ([Newsday, 5/28/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68BB-TFW1-DY2H-J43S-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * The Newsday editorial board publicly supported LaLota’s proposal, emphasizing the importance of permanent protection for Plum Island despite potential loss of mystique ([Newsday, 5/28/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68BB-TFW1-DY2H-J43S-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * A potential vulnerability exists in the public’s possible reluctance to embrace change, as granting monument status may alter the island’s mysterious character and face opposition from those concerned about new federal protections.

**2023: Nick LaLota Requested Biden Designate Plum Island a National Monument** According to an editorial published in Newsday, "In early May, Rep. Nick LaLota, whose 1st Congressional District includes the federally-owned island in the Town of Southold, asked President Joe Biden to support his bill to make Plum Island a national monument or designate it as such immediately under the presidential powers granted by the Antiquities Act of 1906."

**2023: Nick LaLota Argued National Monument Status Would Protect Plum Island's Environment and Heritage** According to an editorial published in Newsday, "LaLota says turning Plum Island into a national monument would protect it as a natural habitat for rare plants and 228 bird species, including some that are federally endangered or threatened, such as piping plovers and roseate terns. It would also preserve its cultural heritage as a previous home for Native Americans before a lighthouse and the U.S. Army's Fort Terry post were built there in the 19th century."

**2023: Nick LaLota Stated National Monument Designation Could Be Achieved in 12-24 Months** According to an editorial published in Newsday, "A slower option would be seeking national park status, but LaLota said a national monument designation would embrace the same goals within a 12-to-24-month timetable for completion."
