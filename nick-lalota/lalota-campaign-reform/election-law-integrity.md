# Election Law and Electoral Integrity

### Summary

> * Nick LaLota did not reside in New York’s 1st Congressional District during his campaigns or while serving, despite previously stating voters expect candidates to live in their district ([Suffolk Times](https://suffolktimes.timesreview.com/2022/02/former-suffolk-boe-commissioner-nick-lalota-announces-campaign-for-congress-zeldin-picks-lieutenant-governor/), [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/nyregion/avlon-lalota-residency-congress.html)).
> * LaLota repeatedly promised to move into NY-1 during both the 2022 and 2024 election cycles, but as of fall 2024 he still lived just outside the district in Amityville, seven miles from the border ([Long Island Press](https://www.longislandpress.com/2022/08/04/august-congressional-primaries/), [Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D85-9T61-JBKF-V15P-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Both state and federal law require only state residency for congressional candidates, but LaLota publicly acknowledged that constituents expect their representative to reside locally ([Suffolk Times](https://suffolktimes.timesreview.com/2022/02/former-suffolk-boe-commissioner-nick-lalota-announces-campaign-for-congress-zeldin-picks-lieutenant-governor/), [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/nyregion/ny-voter-guide-house-races.html)).
> * News coverage noted a credibility concern, highlighting that LaLota has been unable to vote for himself in his own elections and still has not fulfilled his promise to move into the district, raising questions about electoral integrity ([Newsday editorial](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D85-9T61-JBKF-V15P-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * In 2016, LaLota defended the validity of petition signatures for Babylon, stating no fraud had occurred, referencing earlier experience with electoral legal challenges ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5KSF-D801-DY2H-J248-00000-00&context=1519360)).

**Nick LaLota Planned To Move Into NY-1 For Campaign** According to Suffolk Times, "Mr. LoLata, who had screened for the previous congressional seat a few years ago, doesn’t live in 1st District, but he said he plans to move." [Suffolk Times, [2/24/22](https://suffolktimes.timesreview.com/2022/02/former-suffolk-boe-commissioner-nick-lalota-announces-campaign-for-congress-zeldin-picks-lieutenant-governor/)]

**Nick LaLota Stated Voters Expect Congressional Candidates To Reside In District** According to Suffolk Times, "Although the state Constitution merely requires one to be a resident of the state in order to run, I think that voters of the district have a fair expectation that a member of Congress actually live in the district," he said. [Suffolk Times, [2/24/22](https://suffolktimes.timesreview.com/2022/02/former-suffolk-boe-commissioner-nick-lalota-announces-campaign-for-congress-zeldin-picks-lieutenant-governor/)]

**2022: Nick LaLota Lived Outside NY-01 at Time of Congressional Campaign Announcement** According to a press release from the DCCC, "LaLota lived outside of the district at the time of his campaign announcement, but the district lines were struck down in court in April 2022. LaLota’s home was outside the New York 1st Congressional District after the final congressional map was approved." [Press Release - DCCC Research Memo on Nick LaLota, [6/1/22](https://dccc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NY-01-nick-lalota-research-book.pdf)]

**2022: Nick LaLota Announced Move To District While Running** According to Long Island Press, "The married father of three and U.S. Navy veteran is in the process of moving his family into the new district." [Long Island Press, [8/4/22](https://www.longislandpress.com/2022/08/04/august-congressional-primaries/)]

**2024: LaLota Did Not Live In The District He Represents** According to New York Times, "The requirement also benefits Mr. LaLota, who lives in Amityville in Suffolk County, just outside the district." [New York Times, [8/20/24](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/nyregion/avlon-lalota-residency-congress.html)]

**2021-2024: Newsday Editorial Board Reported Nick LaLota Lived Outside His Congressional District** According to an editorial published in Newsday, "Republican Rep. Nicholas J. LaLota does not come to the table with clean hands. He, too, lives outside the district - in Amityville, about seven miles from the district's border. He has had three years since announcing his first run for the seat to move into the district but has not done so, despite making promises that he would. He cannot vote for himself in his own race, and is represented by someone else in Congress." [Editorial - Newsday (New York), [10/24/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D85-9T61-JBKF-V15P-00000-00&context=1519360)]

**2024: Nick LaLota Resided Outside The 1st District By A Few Miles** According to New York Times, "It helps that Mr. LaLota actually resides outside the district, too, though only by a few miles. (Members of Congress are only required to live in the state they represent, not the district.)" [New York Times, [10/27/24](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/nyregion/ny-voter-guide-house-races.html)]
