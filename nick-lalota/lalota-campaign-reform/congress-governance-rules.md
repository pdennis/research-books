### Ethics in Government Operations

#### <span style="text-decoration: underline; border-bottom: 1px solid #999; padding-bottom: 2px;">Criticism of 'Insider Deals' and Public Service Benefits</span>

**September 2015: Trustee Nick LaLota Advocated Ending Lifetime Health Benefits For Former Amityville Village Part-Time Officials** According to Amityville Record (New York), "Now is the time for these former mayors and trustees to acknowledge what their fellow Amityville taxpayers and I already know: No one gets lifetime health benefits after working 10 or 20 years at a part-time job," said La-Lota this week. "Because they won't acquiesce to the obvious, the Village has to spend thousands of dollars on attorneys to ensure our decision to terminate this program holds up in court. Taxpayers would be better offspending those fees on our roads, our beach and our downtown." [Amityville Record (New York), [9/9/15](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5GXW-F071-JD6S-R1HF-00000-00&context=1519360)]

**2015: Nick LaLota Cited Lack Of Transparency In Granting Amityville Village Health Benefits To Part-Time Officials** According to Amityville Record (New York), "It is amazing that these former officials expect Village taxpayers to foot the bill for these costs. This was an insider deal that was completed with no transparency." [Amityville Record (New York), [9/9/15](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5GXW-F071-JD6S-R1HF-00000-00&context=1519360)]

**2015: Nick LaLota Stated 1983 Resolution Allowing Part-Time Officials Village Health Benefits Could Be Rescinded** According to Amityville Record (New York), "LaLota said it also stated that any of the employees eligible for insurance should decline it if they are eligible for health insurance through their full-time jobs or through their spouse's jobs. 'Clearly that was not done,' he said, adding that resolutions are not 'promises of lifetime benefits' and can be rescinded by another board at any time."
