> * Previously accused a political opponent’s raise of being “political payback,” highlighting concerns about patronage and the influence of party leaders in local government decisions ([Newsday, 2018](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5RF1-J5K1-DY2H-J119-00000-00&context=1519360)).
