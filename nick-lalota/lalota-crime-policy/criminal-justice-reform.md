# Criminal Justice Policy and Reform

### Summary

> * Questions about consistency: LaLota repeatedly voiced strong public support for the Amityville police department, yet at the same time pressed for union pay concessions and cost-cutting measures, creating possible concerns over mixed signals or conflicting priorities ([Newsday, 4/21/15](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5FTB-KN31-JBKF-V33W-00000-00&context=1519360); [Amityville Record, 3/5/14](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5BPH-M051-F0NV-F4X5-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Labor relations tensions: LaLota acknowledged "getting off on the wrong foot" and longstanding tension with the police union, which could be framed as difficulty working collaboratively with first responders ([Amityville Record, 3/8/17](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5N24-GGM1-F0NV-F0NM-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Fiscal messaging risk: Calls for pay concessions and focus on reducing police department costs might be portrayed as prioritizing budget cuts at the expense of public safety or employee morale ([Newsday, 4/16/15](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5FS8-RPX1-DY2H-J17S-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Lack of broader reform vision: The record is focused on local cost issues and support for specific initiatives like boating safety, with little evidence of engagement on wider criminal justice reform or systemic issues, which could be criticized as a limited approach ([Press Release - The Islip Bulletin, 7/20/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68RV-2PN1-JBCN-34VV-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> 
> * Potential vulnerability to “soft on unions/tough on police” attacks: Attempts to negotiate for police pay concessions while underscoring support could open LaLota to claims of being either insufficiently supportive of law enforcement personnel or pandering to budget hawks ([Newsday, 4/21/15](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5FTB-KN31-JBKF-V33W-00000-00&context=1519360)).

**February 2014: Nick LaLota Asserted Support For Village Police Department Amid Budget Concerns** According to Amityville Record, 'LaLota said he wants to "debunk" the rumor that he and the administration do not support the police and want to see it disbanded. "We support the full manning, equipment and training of the Village police department and my record reflects that," said LaLota.' [Amityville Record (New York), [3/5/14](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5BPH-M051-F0NV-F4X5-00000-00&context=1519360)]

**2014: LaLota Reaffirmed Commitment To Local Police** According to Amityville Record, "Reinforcing his position and that of the Mayor's, LaLota said at a recent meeting that the board has proven its commitment to the local police. 'Since coming into office, the Wandell administration has shown its support for the Amityville police by hiring new officers, promoting one to detective and approving numerous resolutions for training and new equipment since coming into office. So it's not a question of which department do we want; it's a question of how can we work together to reduce costs to bring tax relief to residents and work on other important projects.'" [Amityville Record (New York), [7/23/14](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5CSP-4RK1-JD6S-R40C-00000-00&context=1519360)]

**2015: Nick LaLota Urged Residents To Consider Police Service Costs** According to Newsday (New York), "Residents should know how much extra service costs so they can evaluate if the service is worth it and join the conversation of urging the union to give concessions to taxpayers," LaLota said in an interview. [Newsday (New York), [4/16/15](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5FS8-RPX1-DY2H-J17S-00000-00&context=1519360)]

**2015: Nick LaLota, As Amityville Trustee, Requested Police Union Pay Concessions** According to Newsday (New York), "Police spending is a longtime sore spot for Amityville trustees. LaLota, Mayor James Wandell and Deputy Mayor Jessica Bernius have repeatedly asked for pay concessions from the Police Benevolent Association, even though the union contract runs to 2018. They say concessions are necessary to the village's fiscal health and this year, for what they say was the first time in recent history, they retained a lawyer to negotiate with the police union." [Newsday (New York), [4/21/15](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5FTB-KN31-JBKF-V33W-00000-00&context=1519360)]

**2017: Nick LaLota Expressed Strong Support For Maintaining Amityville Police Department** According to Amityville Record, "'We love them, we have to keep them,' said LaLota who discussed the police department in a recent interview. 'As a husband and father who often works late, I know that if my family calls 911, the police will be there in 3-4 minutes. This is a service that is valuable to me as it is to every other Amityville Village resident.'" [Amityville Record (New York), [3/8/17](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5N24-GGM1-F0NV-F0NM-00000-00&context=1519360)]

**2017: Nick LaLota Assumed Partial Responsibility For Tensions With Amityville Police Union** According to Amityville Record, "LaLota said there is always tension between employers and employees and that he assumes at least some of the responsibility for getting offon the wrong foot with the police and the PBA President Chris Mullin." [Amityville Record (New York), [3/8/17](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5N24-GGM1-F0NV-F0NM-00000-00&context=1519360)]
