# Overview of Personal Litigation Involving Nick LaLota

### Summary

> * In 2020, Nick LaLota was disqualified from running for New York State Senate due to an "obvious conflict of interest"—he attempted to remain Suffolk County elections commissioner while running for office, which courts ruled was illegal and unacceptable ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60NT-N9X1-JBKF-V00N-00000-00&context=1519360), [DCCC](https://dccc.org/the-case-against-nick-lalota/)).
> * New York state courts determined that LaLota's leave of absence from his commissioner post did not resolve the conflict, resulting in his removal from the ballot and invalidation of his campaign petitions ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:60F0-KD51-JBKF-V016-00000-00&context=1519360)).

> * In other legal matters, LaLota was involved, as a trustee, in potential litigation concerning local zoning and business activities while in Amityville, and was named in a lawsuit involving alleged First Amendment violations after a firefighter was suspended for supporting his mayoral campaign ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5JS3-8V51-JBKF-V0NF-00000-00&context=1519360), [Amityville Record](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5VJ7-M5N1-JBCN-42R2-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * In December 2023, former Representative George Santos claimed he would file a House Ethics Committee complaint against LaLota, highlighting ongoing political vulnerabilities ([Armonk Daily Voice](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69T9-7P91-DXVP-T1TV-00000-00&context=1519360)).
