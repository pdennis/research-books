# Outcomes, Impacts, and Public Response

### Summary

> * Allegations of campaign finance violations, even though dismissed by the FEC, have brought negative attention and provided fodder for opponents’ attacks ([Newsday, 5/21/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C2W-W1V1-JBKF-V0M8-00000-00&context=1519360)).

**LaLota’s Spokesman Dismissed Allegations As Politically Motivated In April 2023** According to East Hampton Star, "Will Kiley, a spokesman for Mr. LaLota, said yesterday that ‘the fact the first time we’re seeing this accusation is from the media, and not from the F.E.C. itself, demonstrates that the complaint is political and weak — a mere attention-grabbing move from a shady do-nothing progressive group that, unlike Congressman Nick LaLota, doesn’t actually care about delivering real results for Long Island families, protecting our environment, and supporting veterans.’" [East Hampton Star, [4/27/23](https://www.easthamptonstar.com/government/2023427/lalota-sued-over-campaign-contributions)]

**2020: Suffolk Democratic Chairman Stated Law Is Clear In LaLota Disqualification** According to Newsday, "Suffolk Democratic Chairman Richard Schaffer said the 'law is clear' and LaLota's leave of absence tactic 'made no sense.'
