# Stance on Judicial Inquiries and Investigations

### Summary

> * In June 2023, Nick LaLota criticized the Justice Department's indictment of former President Trump, suggesting the action appeared politically motivated and inconsistent with the handling of investigations into President Biden ([Newsday, 6/10/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68F3-YGX1-DY2H-J191-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * In December 2023, LaLota voted with other Republican congressmen to formalize a House impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden ([Long Island Press, 12/13/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69W1-47C1-DXVP-T04N-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * LaLota has expressed concern about fairness and political bias in judicial processes, emphasizing that all Americans deserve justice "devoid of any political... motivations."
> * In October 2023, regarding the expulsion of Rep. George Santos, LaLota acknowledged that due process had been given in the case and called for action to be taken ([Newsday, 10/12/23](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:69CJ-MVM1-DY2H-J01W-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * His statements and votes suggest a tendency to scrutinize investigations involving political opponents while supporting accountability for members of his own chamber.
> * Potential vulnerability: LaLota’s actions and rhetoric may be viewed as partisan, raising questions about the consistency of his stance on impartial justice.

Nick LaLota (R-Amityville) said in a statement. 'To the contrary, the Biden Justice Department's indictment of a Former President who is running against Biden, without ... an indictment of their boss who stored classified material in his Delaware garage, reeks of political retaliation,' LaLota said."
