> * He has held multiple chief of staff positions, which may raise questions about real-world private sector experience versus a government-focused background ([Amityville Record](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5BR6-WY21-F0NV-F2K7-00000-00&context=1519360), [Long Island Press](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:66M5-CGS1-JBCN-4033-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Opponents have accused LaLota of being ineffective or entrenched in establishment politics due to his long tenure in Suffolk County government and Democratic association in veterans’ affairs work for Rep.
