# Voting Rights and Election Integrity

### Summary

> * LaLota previously claimed in 2016 that New York’s election system was “vulnerable to fraud,” aligning himself with election conspiracy theories, which could be used to question his consistency or intent regarding election integrity ([DCCC press release](https://dccc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NY-01-nick-lalota-research-book.pdf)).
> * His more recent statements express confidence in New York’s election process, potentially highlighting a shift or perceived flip-flop in his stance on election security ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CHG-4XC1-DY2H-J3VK-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Despite his 2016 claims, LaLota now encourages voter participation and affirms he would have voted to certify the 2020 presidential results, which may appear inconsistent to both critics and supporters ([Suffolk Times](https://suffolktimes.timesreview.com/2024/10/election-2024-meet-the-candidates-congressional-district-1-nick-lalota/)).
> * His strong public support for civic engagement, including encouraging students and all voters to participate, can be critiqued as an attempt to distance himself from previous doubts he raised about election validity ([Statesman: SUNY, Stony Brook](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D9W-HY71-JBCN-326G-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Record turnout in early voting during a contentious race in his district draws attention to his evolving messaging and raises questions about whether past rhetoric or current statements more accurately reflect his true views on election security ([Times-Union](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6DBR-S3H1-JBM5-S151-00000-00&context=1519360)).
