# Abortion Policy Stance

### Summary

> * LaLota’s history of applauding the repeal of Roe v. Wade and calling it a "step in the right direction"—comments now scrubbed from his website—undercuts recent efforts to present a more moderate abortion stance ([City & State, 8/11/22](https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/08/lee-zeldins-congressional-district-gop-candidates-attack-each-other-insiders/375749/); [Newsday, 10/22/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D7R-C931-JBKF-V533-00000-00&context=1519360))
> * Despite repeatedly stating opposition to a national abortion ban, LaLota endorsed or was affiliated with Republican Study Committee proposals for federal abortion restrictions, exposing him to charges of inconsistency ([City & State, 7/24/23](https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2023/07/ny-swing-district-republicans-are-less-neutral-abortion-they-promised/388773/))
> * LaLota’s support for abortion bans after the first trimester and for increased parental notification requirements are out of step with the broader preferences of his moderate district, as noted by editorial boards ([Newsday, 10/24/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D85-9T61-JBKF-V15P-00000-00&context=1519360))
> * Endorsements from anti-abortion groups and his support for limiting abortion protections in New York provide ammunition for critics who paint him as more extreme than he currently portrays ([DCCC, 8/24/22](https://dccc.org/the-case-against-nick-lalota/))
> * Voting to restrict abortion access for service members and opposing federal abortion funding conflict with claims of embracing a moderate, state-based approach—further complicating his messaging ([New York Times, 8/17/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6CRN-MNX1-DXY4-X0K7-00000-00&context=1519360); [PoliticsNY, 10/14/22](https://politicsny.com/2022/10/14/meet-the-candidates-general-election-nick-lalota-congressional-district-1/))
