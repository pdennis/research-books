# Family Planning and Reproductive Health

### Summary

> * Public positions from Nick LaLota supporting IVF access and protections may leave him exposed to criticism from more conservative or anti-IVF factions within his party ([Patch, 10/23/24](https://patch.com/new-york/lindenhurst/candidate-profile-nick-lalota-nys-1st-congressional-district); [Newsday, 6/13/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C7T-67K1-JBKF-V00N-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Vocal support for over-the-counter contraception could create friction with constituents or activists opposed to expanded contraceptive access ([Newsday, 6/13/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C7T-67K1-JBKF-V00N-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Aligning with bipartisan or Democratic lawmakers on IVF and contraception issues may be perceived as out of step with the conservative base, potentially weakening support from primary voters ([Newsday, 6/13/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6C7T-67K1-JBKF-V00N-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Statements and legislative actions in favor of reproductive health measures could be targeted by political opponents as inconsistent with broader Republican efforts to limit reproductive rights.
> * Endorsements of reproductive health protections may not fully insulate LaLota from criticism if future legislation or party platforms become less supportive of IVF or contraception.
