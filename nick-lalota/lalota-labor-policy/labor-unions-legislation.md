# Legislation and Voting Records on Labor Unions

### Summary

> * In 2015, Nick LaLota described Amityville Village's proposed night differential for police as "relatively generous," stating that it compared favorably to the Suffolk County PBA standard and highlighting the village's efforts to be "as liberal as possible" in negotiations ([Newsday, 6/15/15](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5G73-0N71-DY2H-J19G-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * LaLota criticized the Amityville PBA for asking for contract terms exceeding those of their Suffolk County counterparts, arguing that such requests did not take into account the village's serious financial difficulties ([Newsday, 6/15/15](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5G73-0N71-DY2H-J19G-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * From at least 2017, LaLota had a contentious relationship with the local police union, urging the union to reopen their contract and provide financial concessions to help address the village's financial crisis ([Amityville Record, 7/19/17](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5P2N-3K31-JBCN-4112-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * LaLota's stances consistently emphasized fiscal responsibility, prioritizing the village's financial health over union demands, which sometimes put him at odds with union leadership.
> * Potential vulnerability: LaLota's public disputes with the police union and calls for contract givebacks could be criticized by labor groups or union supporters as being unsupportive of organized labor.

### Support and Opposition to Union-Related Legislation

**2017: Nick Lalota Was At Odds With Police Union President Christian Mullin Over Police Contract** According to Amityville Record, "Mullin is the president of the police officer's union and the two have sparred, personally and publicly, since Lalota was elected to office. Lalota consistently pointed to the costs of police services in the Village and asked the union to open the contract and provide some financial givebacks to help the Village over its financial crisis."
