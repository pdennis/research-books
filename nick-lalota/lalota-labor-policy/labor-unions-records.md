**2015: Nick LaLota Criticized Previous Mayor For Police Contract Approval Timing** According to Newsday, 'LaLota and Deputy Mayor Jessica Bernius last week criticized the administration of former Mayor Peter Imbert for approving the contract in its waning days in office in 2013. "That should have been reserved for this board to sign, not done by a lame duck board to bind this board for five years and $30 million," LaLota said. The village should have retained a labor management lawyer from the start, he added.'
