**2024: LaLota Criticized Avlon’s Support Of Prop 1 And Focused On Local Issues In Debates** According to City & State New York, "LaLota spent the final weeks of his campaign focusing heavily on Avlon’s support of Prop 1, the ballot proposal to add the Equal Rights Amendment to the state constitution. LaLota accused Avlon of failing to protect girls’ sports – a common conservative line of attack against the amendment, which would both strengthen abortion rights and prohibit discrimination against people based on their gender identity. In debates, LaLota steered the conversation away from Trump and back toward local constituent issues."

**LaLota Cited Concerns About NY Proposition 1** According to Newsday, "The congressman then turned the conversation to New York's Proposition 1, which would protect people from discrimination based on gender identity and reproductive freedom. LaLota said it would codify 'the right of a man to play in a girls sport.'"
