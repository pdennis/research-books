# Emergency Preparedness and Response

### Summary

> * Rep. Nick LaLota secured $3 million in federal funding to repair the Greenport Harbor bulkhead, aimed at protecting against rising sea levels and extreme weather events ([Suffolk Times](https://suffolktimes.timesreview.com/2024/10/election-2024-meet-the-candidates-congressional-district-1-nick-lalota/), 10/21/24).
> * LaLota praised the swift emergency response from nearly 90 agencies during a major fire in Westhampton, highlighting effective local coordination ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F9F-DDG3-RSVP-10NT-00000-00&context=1519360), 3/10/25).
> * He pledged to advocate for federal disaster assistance if damages from the Westhampton fire meet the FEMA disaster declaration threshold, showing a willingness to seek additional support when necessary ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F9F-DDG3-RSVP-10NT-00000-00&context=1519360), 3/10/25).
> * As of March 2025, the damages from the Westhampton fire had not reached the $37 million uninsured loss level needed for FEMA intervention, marking a potential vulnerability if future events surpass this threshold.
> * LaLota’s actions demonstrate a proactive approach to securing funding for infrastructure and disaster response, though reliance on federal disaster thresholds could delay aid in cases of severe but sub-threshold events.
