**2025: Nick LaLota Joined Republican Representatives in Objecting to WTC Health Program Cuts** According to an editorial published in Newsday (New York), "this week, [Andrew Garbarino] led a group of New York and New Jersey Republican representatives, including LaLota, in writing a letter to Trump expressing what they called ‘grave concerns’ regarding the program staff and research cuts. They rightly suggest ‘fencing off’ the program from ‘any further staff and funding reductions.’" [Editorial - Newsday (New York), [2/21/25](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F5R-Y3W3-RRYD-X1MJ-00000-00&context=1519360)]
