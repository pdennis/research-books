# Spending Priorities and Fiscal Responsibility

### Summary

> * LaLota’s support for deep spending cuts—including an $880 billion budget reduction blueprint—opens him to criticism for potentially targeting key social safety net programs like Medicaid, despite his statements that vital programs would be protected ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6F89-KFX3-RV9T-3352-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * His repeated references to the need for urgent fiscal action, often echoing partisan rhetoric and supporting proposals from "disruptor" presidents, may alienate centrists or those wary of disruptive politics and drastic federal cuts ([Long Island Business News](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FGP-26X3-RSDR-G1NF-00000-00&context=1519360), [Massapequa Post](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FGW-WGP3-RSP4-44HD-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * LaLota has a local record of supporting budget compliance by opposing property tax increases yet was associated with proposals that could have raised taxes by up to 11% for Amityville residents, providing opponents with ammunition to call him inconsistent ([DCCC press release](https://dccc.org/the-case-against-nick-lalota/)).
> * There are multiple instances where LaLota prioritized meeting budget caps through service cuts, public sector benefit reductions, or consolidations—moves that can be cast as risking essential services, public employee benefits, or local quality of life ([Newsday](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5HWB-8DR1-JBKF-V3JB-00000-00&context=1519360), [Amityville Record](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5HX8-H331-JD6S-R1WP-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * LaLota’s focus on fiscal austerity and harsh critiques of bipartisan failure to balance budgets for 25 years may reflect negatively on his ability to build collaborative policy solutions or could be seen as overly ideological ([Oyster Bay Guardian](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FH3-HNB3-RSD3-70KN-00000-00&context=1519360), [Babylon Beacon](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6FGW-WGP3-RSP4-44RH-00000-00&context=1519360)).
