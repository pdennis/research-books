# Campaign Issues and Positions

### Summary

> * LaLota has faced criticism for allegedly backtracking on campaign promises and aligning with "extremism," such as voting to restrict abortion and cutting funding for public safety and aid to Israel ([East Hampton Star](https://www.easthamptonstar.com/government/2024122/lalota-lines-behind-trump)).
> * Opponents, including Democrats, have questioned LaLota’s residency, claiming he does not live in the NY-1 district he represents ([Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/john-avlon-cnn-congress-nick-lalota-1235852006/)).
> * LaLota’s approach to the George Santos controversy opened him to scrutiny for not supporting immediate expulsion, opting instead to refer the issue to the House Ethics Committee; this led to doubts about his willingness to act decisively ([Newsday Editorial](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:688M-JNG1-JBKF-V43C-00000-00&context=1519360), [Oyster Bay Guardian](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:68B9-B0J1-DXVP-T51H-00000-00&context=1519360)).
