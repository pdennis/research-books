# Board and Commission Service

### Summary

> * LaLota simultaneously held roles as Amityville Village Trustee and Suffolk County Election Commissioner, a situation allowed by state law but potentially perceived as a conflict of interest, especially since he had to recuse himself from village election matters where he was a candidate ([Newsday, 2/23/15](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5FC6-DP71-DY2H-J0GX-00000-00&context=1519360); [Amityville Record, 2/11/15](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5F94-MV71-F0NV-F0T9-00000-00&context=1519360))
> * Questions arose about the accuracy of timekeeping and whether LaLota’s out-of-office calls and emails counted as legitimate county work hours, prompting an audit and his subsequent pledge to install biometric time clocks for accountability ([Newsday, 6/9/19](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5W9C-2DH1-DY2H-J02V-00000-00&context=1519360))
> * Some colleagues criticized LaLota for not fully utilizing his election commission expertise in local GOP petition and ballot drive efforts, which resulted in procedural mistakes and rejected petitions ([Amityville Record, 10/5/16](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5KWD-4WJ1-JD6S-R425-00000-00&context=1519360))
> * Rollouts of technological updates for polling, such as new check-in systems and early voting, encountered glitches and voter delays; LaLota attributed these to limited preparation and resource constraints, highlighting operational vulnerabilities under his leadership ([Newsday, 10/27/19](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5XC7-02V1-DY2H-J0MP-00000-00&context=1519360))
> * LaLota’s role in ruling on ballot petition objections (e.g., upholding a “fatal defect” on technicalities), while technically correct, opened him to criticism for harshness and inconsistency with the norm of leniency in local elections ([Newsday, 2/22/19](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5VGH-VY31-JBKF-V53R-00000-00&context=1519360))
