# Affordable Housing Initiatives

### Summary

> * In 2014, Nick LaLota advanced a tax abatement proposal to encourage downtown living and increase foot traffic in Amityville, focusing on the downtown area and potentially excluding projects like the Brunswick Hospital property ([Newsday, 6/23/14](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5CGY-D4W1-JBKF-V01K-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * LaLota argued that Amityville's police pay structure was financially unsustainable, referencing a New York State comptroller’s report and substantial municipal debt ([Newsday, 7/22/14](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5CR4-JDK1-DY2H-J33W-00000-00&context=1519360)), suggesting fiscal constraints may impact housing initiatives.
> * As a village trustee in 2016, LaLota proposed creating a transit-oriented district to replace industrial areas near the Amityville LIRR station with residential development, considering higher-density and taller buildings closer to transit, and promoting amenities for increased density ([Newsday, 5/17/16](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5JSY-5JG1-DY2H-J19J-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * LaLota described shifting from industrial to high-end residential use near the train station as an "upgrade" for the village, emphasizing local priorities in redevelopment ([Newsday, 5/17/16](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5JSY-5JG1-DY2H-J19J-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * In 2024, LaLota opposed federal and state intervention in local housing construction, stating that decisions should remain with local governments, while supporting local reuse of strip malls for housing and advocating first-time homebuyer tax credits ([Newsday, 10/22/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D7R-C931-JBKF-V533-00000-00&context=1519360); [Editorial, Newsday, 10/24/24](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D85-9T61-JBKF-V15P-00000-00&context=1519360)).
> * Potential vulnerability: LaLota’s resistance to broader government involvement in affordable housing could limit access to additional funding or policy tools that may be available at the federal or state level.
