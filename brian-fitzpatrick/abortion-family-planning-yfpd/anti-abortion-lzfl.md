### Condemning Violence Against Pro-Life Facilities And Groups

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted For A Resolution That Condemned Vandalism And
Violence Against Anti-Abortion Organizations, Recognized "The Sanctity
Of Life," And Called On The Biden Administration To Protect The Rights
Of Pro-Life Entities.** In January 2023, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for a concurrent resolution that would
"state that Congress condemns attacks of vandalism, violence and
destruction against pro-life facilities, groups and churches and
recognizes 'the sanctity of life and the important role that \[such
entities\] play in supporting pregnant women, infants and families.' It
would also call on the Biden administration to use all appropriate law
enforcement authorities to protect the rights of such entities." The
vote was on passage. The House agreed to the resolution by a vote of
222-209. \[House Vote 30,
