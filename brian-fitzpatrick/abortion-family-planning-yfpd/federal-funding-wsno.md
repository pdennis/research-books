# Federal Funding

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For Blocking Funding For Family Planning And
Reproductive Health Through The USAID.** In June 2019, Fitzpatrick voted
for an amendment to the FY 2020 minibus that would, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "strike from the bill a provision allocating
\$750 million for family planning and reproductive health programs,
including in areas where population growth threatens biodiversity, from
funding provided by the bill for U.S. Agency for International
Development global health programs." The vote was on adoption of the
amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 188-225.

-   **Planned Parenthood Included This Amendment On Their Congressional
    Scorecard, As It Jeopardized "Critical And Lifesaving International
    Family Planning And Reproductive Health Programs.** " According to
    Planned Parenthood, "Over 24 million women receive contraceptives
    from U.S. supported international family planning programs based on
    FY 2019 funding levels - and millions more stand to gain access with
    the designated \$750 million funding level. In FY 2019, the U.S.
    invested \$607.5 million in international family planning and
    reproductive health, including \$32.5 million for UNFPA. The Lesko
    amendment would jeopardize these critical and lifesaving
    international family planning and reproductive health programs by
    cutting much needed funding to keep the programs running. We cannot
    improve women's health, address the unacceptably high maternal
    mortality rate, and support healthy families globally, without
    robust investments in international family planning. This spending
    will ensure women can access family planning counseling and the full
    range of contraceptive options that they want." \[Planned

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Amendment To The FY 2020 Minibus That
Would Make It More Difficult For Federally Funded Facilities To Provide
Abortion Services.** In June 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that
would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "strike from the bill a
provision requiring the Health and Human Services Department to
administer certain family planning program grants under statutory
frameworks in effect as of January 18, 2017. The provision that would be
struck down would effectively block implementation of a March 2019 HHS
rule related to grants for facilities providing abortions." The vote was
on adoption of the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote
of 191-231. \[House Vote 267,

-   **The Amendment Would Have Upheld A Trump Administration Rule That
    Aimed To Hinder Planned Parenthood From Providing Abortion
    Services.** According to The Atlantic, "In late February, the Trump
    administration dropped a new rule that has alarmed doctors' groups
    and brought conservatives closer to achieving their long quest to
    defund Planned Parenthood. Clinics that receive funds from the
    federal family-planning grant program Title X will no longer be able
    to perform abortions in the same space where they see other
    patients. Abortion and other health-care services will be required
    to be physically and financially separate entities. Title X
    participants will also no longer be able to refer patients to
    abortion providers, though they can mention abortion to their
    patients. About 20 percent of Title X providers would potentially
    have to renovate their clinics to meet the new guidelines, according
    to the Department of Health and Human Services. It will likely cost
    each of these providers \$20,000 to \$40,000 to come into compliance
    with the physical-separation element of the new rule." \[The

-   **The Rule Would Have Made It More Difficult For Poor Women To
    Access Medical Services Unrelated To Abortions.** According to the
    Atlantic, "Such a measure might conjure images of scores of Planned
    Parenthood clinics suddenly closing their doors. But the impacts of
    the rule are likely to be more subtle, and to mostly affect poor
    women's access to medical services unrelated to abortions." \[The

### Permanently Banning Federal Funds To Pay For Abortion Or Abortion Coverage

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Permanently Ban Federal Funding For
Abortion Services.** In January 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for codifying
the Hyde Amendment. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Passage of
the bill that would permanently prohibit federal funds from being used
to pay for abortion services or health insurance plans that include
abortion coverage. It also would prohibit the District of Columbia from
using its own local funds to provide or pay for abortions. Individuals
and small businesses also could not receive tax credits under the 2010
health care law related to purchases of health insurance plans that
include abortion coverage. The bill would require the Office of
Personnel Management to ensure that, starting in 2018, no multistate
qualified health plan offered in a state insurance exchange provides
coverage that includes abortion. The provisions would not apply to
pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, or to situations where the
woman would die unless an abortion is performed." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 238 to 183. The Senate
took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 65,

-   **Legislation Would Essentially Codify The Hyde Amendment.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Even if the bill is signed
    into law, the current status quo won\'t substantially change.
    Similar language restricting abortion funding, known as the Hyde
    Amendment, has been included in annual spending bills since 1976. It
    says that no appropriated funds can be used for abortions or for
    health plans that include abortion coverage except for pregnancies
    caused by rape or incest or if the pregnancy threatens the life of
    the mother." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [1/24/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-5026931?244)\]

-   **Legislation Would Prevent Refundable Tax Credits To Be Used For
    Health Insurers That Provide Abortion.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "However, the bill would go further than the Hyde
    Amendment by trying to impose burdens on insurance companies or
    individuals who use private money to pay for abortions. For
    instance, it would disallow the use of refundable tax credits and
    cost sharing-reductions for health insurers and small employers that
    provide abortion coverage." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [1/24/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-5026931?244)\]
