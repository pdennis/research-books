# Contraception

### Codifying Access To Contraceptives

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Codify The Right To Access Contraceptives
And The Right For Health Care Providers To Provide Contraceptives To
Their Patients.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted for the Right to Contraception Act, which would
"protect a person\'s ability to access contraceptives and to engage in
contraception, and to protect a health care provider\'s ability to
provide contraceptives, contraception, and information related to
contraception." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote 228-195, thus the bill was sent to Senate. The Senate did not take
substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 385,

-   **The Bill Was A Resulted From The U.S. Supreme Court's Overturn Of
    Roe V. Wade And Concerns That The Court May Revisit Same-Sex
    Marriage And The Right To Contraception.** According to The New York
    Times, "House Democratic leaders opted to move forward with the bill
    after the Supreme Court's decision overturning abortion rights
    raised worries about the prospect that the justices might revisit
    cases that affirmed same-sex marriage rights and the right to
    contraception. The debate in Congress thrust the issue into the
    midterm election campaign, where Democrats are eager to draw a
    distinction between their party's support for L.G.B.T.Q. rights and
    opposition by many Republicans." \[New York Times,
    [7/19/22](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/us/politics/house-gay-marriage-bill.html)\]

-   **The Bill Would Establish The Federal Right For Contraception
    Access And The Right For Medical Providers To Provide
    Contraceptives.** According to Reuters, "The bill would create a
    federal right for people to access contraceptives and for doctors
    and pharmacists to provide them. Contraceptives are used by 88% of
    U.S. women of childbearing age who are not trying to get pregnant,
    according to the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights advocacy
    group." \[Reuters,

-   **Although None Have Passed, Several State Legislatures Have
    Introduced Legislation To Restrict Contraceptive Access And 12
    States Currently Permit Health Care Providers To Refuse To Prescribe
    Contraception.** According to Reuters, "Some state legislatures have
    introduced bills to restrict access to contraceptives, though they
    have not passed. In addition, 12 states allow health providers to
    refuse contraception, according to the Guttmacher Institute."

-   **The Bill Would Protect Oral And Emergency Contraceptives,
    Intrauterine Devices And Condoms.** According to The Hill,
    "Contraceptives protected under the legislation include oral and
    emergency medications, intrauterine devices and condoms." \[The
    Hill,

-   **The Bill Would Allow The U.S. Attorney General, Health Care
    Providers And Injured Individuals To Sue States That Violate The
    Right To Contraception Access.** According to The Hill,
    "Additionally, the bill authorizes the attorney general, health care
    providers and other individuals to take civil action against any
    states that violate the provisions of the bill." \[The Hill,
    [7/21/22](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3568824-house-passes-bill-to-protect-access-to-contraceptives-after-supreme-court-warning-shot/)\]

-   **Some House Republicans Claimed The Bill Was Too Broad And Could
    Violate Religious Liberty Protections.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "But some House Republicans who opposed the contraception
    bill, sponsored by Rep. Kathy Manning, D-N.C., said they worried the
    legislation was too broad and could limit protections under a
    religious liberty law known as the Religious Restoration Freedom Act
    of 1993. They also worried that the bill could violate other federal
    and state moral protection laws." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [7/21/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7530580?18&srcpage=home&srcsec=ina)\]

-   **Some House Republicans Claimed The Bill Would Increase Funding For
    Abortion Providers And That The Right To Contraception Would Be
    Interpreted To Protect Medication Abortion Drugs.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Other Republicans, meanwhile, said the
    bill would increase funds for abortion providers and be interpreted
    to cover the right to medication abortion drugs." \[Congressional
    Quarterly,
    [7/21/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7530580?18&srcpage=home&srcsec=ina)\]

-   **Congressman Frank Pallone (D) Clarified That The Bill Defined
    Contraceptives As FDA-Regulated Products And Emphasized That The
    Bill Would Not Prevent The FDA From Removing Unsafe Products.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "But House Energy and Commerce
    Chairman Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., disagreed with that
    interpretation. 'This bill defines contraceptives as those legally
    marked under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,' said Pallone,
    referring to the 1938 law that granted FDA authority. 'Nothing
    prevents FDA to \[sic\] remove unsafe products from the market.'"

Contraceptives.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly,

to the House Energy and Commerce Committee." The vote was on a motion to
recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote 190-234. \[House Vote

**2022: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against An Amendment That Included
Biological Products And FDA-Regulated Products In The Definition Of
"Contraceptives," Specified That "Health Care Providers" Were Authorized
Providers, And Clarified That The Contraception Access Bill Did Not
Sanction Forced Sterilization.** In July 2022, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick effectively voted against the
management's amendment, which would "specify that the bill\'s definition
of 'contraceptive' includes biological products and is limited to
products legally marketed under existing Food and Drug Administration
regulations; clarify the bill\'s definition of 'health care provider' to
state that providers must be authorized by the state to provide health
care services; specify that the bill may not be construed to sanction
sterilization procedures without a patient\'s informed consent; and make
technical changes." The vote was on the adoption of the rule. The House
adopted the rule by a vote 219-200, thus the manager's amendment was
automatically adopted. \[House Vote 366,
