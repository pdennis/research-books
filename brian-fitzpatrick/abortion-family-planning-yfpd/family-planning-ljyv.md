### Funding

Health Programs, Including \$760 Million For Family Planning And
Reproductive Health Programs.** In July 2021, Fitzpatrick voted against
the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs
Appropriations Act, 2022 which would, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "provide \$4.6 billion for global health programs, including
\$760 million for family planning and reproductive health programs. It
would provide over \$3 billion to address climate change and other
environmental issues, including \$1.6 billion for a multilateral Green
Climate Fund to help developing countries address climate change, \$269
million for renewable energy programs, and \$125 million to combat
wildlife trafficking." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 217-212, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The
bill ultimately became law. \[House Vote 243,

### Service Members

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For Providing Family Planning Services For
Members Of The Armed Forces.** In July 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for an
amendment to the House FY 2020 NDAA that would, according to

consultation with the Coast Guard, to establish a uniform standard
curriculum to be used in education programs on family planning for all
members of the Armed Forces." The vote was on adoption. The House
adopted the amendment by a vote of 231-199. \[House Vote 440,

-   **Planned Parenthood Included This Amendment On Their Congressional
    Scorecard, As It "Ensures Service Members Are Provided The
    Information They Need To Make Informed Sexual And Reproductive
    Health Decisions.** According to Planned Parenthood, "Family
    planning is one of the ten great public health achievements of the
    20th century. The availability of family planning services allows
    individuals to achieve desired birth spacing and family size, and
    contributes to improved health outcomes for infants, children,
    women, and families. Congresswoman Speier's amendment works to
    ensure service members are provided the information they need to
    make informed sexual and reproductive health decisions, and that
    they are provided these resources during the first year of service.
