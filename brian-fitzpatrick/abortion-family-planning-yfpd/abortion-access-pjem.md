# Abortion Access Protections

### Codifying Abortion Protections

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Codifying The Right To Receive
Abortion Services And The Right For Medical Providers To Provide
Abortion Services And Against Prohibiting Abortion Restrictions.** In
July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted
against the Women's Health Protection Act of 2022, which would
"statutorily establish that health care providers have a right to
provide and patients have a right to receive abortion services, and it
would prohibit certain restrictions related to abortion services. The
bill would specify that rights established by the bill may not be
restricted by certain requirements or limitations related to abortion
services, including prohibitions on abortion prior to fetal viability,
or after fetal viability if a provider determines that continuation of a
pregnancy would pose a risk to a patient\'s life or health; requirements
that patients disclose reasons for seeking an abortion or make medically
unnecessary in-person appointments; requirements that providers provide
medically inaccurate information or perform specific medical tests or
procedures in connection with the provision of abortion services;
limitations on providers\' ability to prescribe drugs based on
good-faith medical judgment, provide services via telemedicine or
provide immediate services when a delay would pose a risk to a
patient\'s health; and requirements for facilities and personnel that
would not apply to facilities providing medically comparable procedures.
It would also prohibit requirements or limitations that are similar to
those established by the bill or that impede access to abortion services
and expressly or implicitly single out abortion services, providers or
facilities." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote 219-210, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate did not
take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 360,

Quarterly, [7/15/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/360?3);
Congressional Actions, [H.R.
8296](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8296/actions)\]

-   **The Bill Specified The Factors That Courts Could Consider When
    Determining Whether A Regulation Were To Limit Or Impede Access To
    Abortion And Required The Party Defending The Regulation To Prove
    That It Advances The Safety Of Abortion Or The Patient's Health.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "It would specify factors that
    courts may consider to determine whether a requirement or limitation
    impedes access to abortion services, including whether it interferes
    with providers\' ability to provide services; poses a risk to
    patients\' health; is likely to delay or deter patients in accessing
    services or necessitate in-person visits that would not otherwise be
    required; is likely to result in a decreased availability of
    services in a state or region; is likely to result in increased
    costs of providing or obtaining services; or imposes penalties that
    are not imposed on other health care providers for comparable
    conduct. It would require a party defending a requirement or
    limitation to establish that it significantly advances the safety of
    abortion services or patient health and that such goals cannot be
    advanced by a less restrictive alternative measure." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [7/15/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/360?3)\]

-   **The Bill Authorized The Justice Department, Medical Providers, And
    Individuals And Entities To Sue In Federal Court Against Any
    Governmental Entity That Were To Implement Abortion Restrictions.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "It would authorize the
    Justice Department, health care providers and private individuals
    and entities to bring a civil action in U.S. district court for
    injunctive relief against any state or government official charged
    with implementing or enforcing a requirement or limitation
    challenged as a violation of rights established by the bill. It
    would authorize district courts to award appropriate equitable
    relief, including temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive
    relief, and to award costs of litigation to a prevailing plaintiff.
    It would require courts to 'liberally construe' provisions of the
    bill to effectuate its purposes." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [7/15/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/360?3)\]

-   **H.R. 8296 Was An Identical Bill To The Abortion Protections Bill
    Passed In September 2021 By The House, H.R. 3755, But Adds Findings
    Over The Dobbs Case That Overturned Roe V. Wade.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The bill is substantively identical to HR
    3755, which the House passed in September 2021, but adds findings
    related to the June 2022 Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson
    Women\'s Health Organization." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [7/15/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/360?3)\]

-   **The Bill Was Another Attempt To Codify Roe V. Wade After The
    Senate Failed To Advance The First Version Of The Bill In May
    2022.** According to The Washington Post, "One bill, the Women's
    Health Protection Act, would enshrine the protections of Roe v. Wade
    into law. The House already passed the bill last year, but it did
    not advance in a Senate vote in May. The House passed the bill,
    219-210, prompting applause from Democrats in the chamber. All
    Republicans and Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.) voted against the
    measure." \[The Washington Post,
    [7/15/22](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/15/house-abortion-roe-v-wade/)\]

-   **Republicans Falsely Mislabeled The Bill As The "Abortions On
    Demand Until Birth Act."** According to The Washington Post, "As
    further proof of their opposition to the measure, Republicans
    falsely renamed the legislation in their whip notice as the
    'Abortions on Demand until Birth Act' --- which is a
    misrepresentation of the bill --- and repeated that claim on the
    House floor." \[The Washington Post,
    [7/15/22](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/15/house-abortion-roe-v-wade/)\]

-   **The Bill Would Establish The Right For Medical Providers To
    Provide Abortion Services And Their Patients The Right To Receive
    Them And Invalidate State Restrictions That Were Implemented After
    The Reversal Of Roe V. Wade.** According to The New York Times, "A
    second measure, a version of which passed the House last year, would
    explicitly give health care providers the right to provide abortion
    services and their patients the right to obtain them, invalidating a
    variety of state restrictions that were enacted in the aftermath of
    the Supreme Court's decision reversing Roe v. Wade and ending the
    constitutional right to abortion. That second measure, the Women's
    Health Protection Act, passed 219 to 210, also mainly along party
    lines, with one Democrat, Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas,
    voting with Republicans." \[New York Times,
    [7/15/22](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/us/politics/house-passes-abortion-access-bills.html)\]

-   **The Bill Would Allow Abortions After Viability Only In Health- Or
    Life-Threatening Circumstances.** According to The New York Times,
    "In reality, the Democratic bill allows abortions after viability
    only in circumstances when a doctor determines that the continuation
    of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the patient's life or health."
    \[New York Times,
    [7/15/22](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/us/politics/house-passes-abortion-access-bills.html)\]

**2022: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against Codifying Abortion Access
Protections.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted for the "Fischbach, R-Minn., motion to recommit the
bill to the House Energy and Commerce Committee." The vote was on a
motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote 209-218.

-   **The Bill Would Require Defendants Of Abortion Limitations To
    Demonstrate That The Limitation Would Advance Abortion Services And
    Why A Less Restrictive Measure Would Be Ineffective.** According to

    action in U.S. district court for injunctive relief against any
    state or government official charged with implementing or enforcing
    a requirement or limitation challenged as a violation of rights

    Put In Statute Health Care Providers' Right To Provide Abortions
    Before Fetal Viability Without Limitations Imposed By States.**
    According to NPR, "The Women's Health Protection Act would protect a
    person's ability to decide to continue or end a pregnancy and would
    enshrine into law health care providers' ability to offer abortion
    services 'prior to fetal viability' without restrictions imposed by
    individual states, like requiring special admitting privileges for
    providers or imposing waiting periods." \[NPR,
    [9/24/21](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/24/1038931908/house-democrats-abortion-rights-bill)\]

-   **The Bill Would Establish A Statutory Right To Provide Abortions
    And A Corresponding Right For Patients To Receive Abortions, Free
    From Restrictions Specific To Abortion Facilities That Hinder
    Access.** According to Act For Women, "WHPA would create a statutory
    right for health care providers to provide abortion care, and a
    corresponding right for their patients to receive that care, free
    from medically unnecessary restrictions that single out abortion and
    impede access." \[Act For Women, [Accessed on

-   **The Bill Would Protect Abortion Access Even If The Supreme Court
    Were To Rule To Weaken Abortion Rights.** According to Vox, "The
    proposed federal law would provide sweeping protections that ensure
    that people have abortion access even if the Supreme Court rules to
    weaken reproductive rights. " \[Vox,

-   **While The Bill Would Protect Abortion Access, The Bill Would Not
    Supersede Laws Regarding Insurance Coverage For Abortions.**
    According to Vox, "It wouldn't, however, supersede laws addressing
    insurance coverage for abortions." \[Vox,
    [2/28/22](https://www.vox.com/2022/2/28/22946299/womens-health-protection-act-senate-vote-abortion-rights)\]

-   **The Measure Would Prohibit Restrictions Imposed By States,
    Including Mandatory Waiting Periods And Limitation On When A
    Pregnancy Can Be Terminated.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "The bill would prohibit some state-level restrictions such as bans
    on mandatory waiting periods and limits on when during pregnancy an
    abortion can be performed." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [9/24/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6349596?1)\]

-   **The Bill Would Ban Restrictions On Abortions After Fetal Viability
    When The Pregnant Individual's Life Is At Risk.** According to NPR,
    "It also would prohibit restrictions on abortion after fetal
    viability 'when, in the good-faith medical judgment of the treating
    health care provider, continuation of the pregnancy would pose a
    risk to the pregnant patient's life or health.'" \[NPR,
    [9/24/21](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/24/1038931908/house-democrats-abortion-rights-bill)\]

-   **Republicans Argued The Bill Was Too Extreme For Limiting States'
    Abilities To Regulate Abortions.** According to NPR, "Republicans
    argued that the bill goes too far, essentially limiting a state's
    ability to regulate or restrict abortions." \[NPR,
    [9/24/21](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/24/1038931908/house-democrats-abortion-rights-bill)\]

-   **Roe V. Wade Protected The Right To An Abortion Before Fetal
    Viability, Typically 23 Or 24 Weeks.** According to Reuters, "The
    right to have an abortion prior to fetal viability, typically around
    23 or 24 weeks, has been protected under the Constitution since the
    Supreme Court's 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade." \[Reuters,

-   **The Bill Would Forbid Unnecessary Restrictions On Abortion,
    Including Forced Waiting Periods, Counseling And Ultrasounds.**
    According to Act For Women, "WHPA protects the right to access
    abortion free from medically unnecessary restrictions and bans on
    abortion---including mandatory waiting periods, biased counseling,
    two-trip requirements, and mandatory ultrasounds." \[Act For Women,
    [Accessed on
    2/28/22](https://actforwomen.org/the-womens-health-protection-act/)\]

-   **The Bill Would Supersede State Laws Restricting Abortions And
    Effectively Neutralize State Laws In 19 States That Have Hindered
    Abortion Access Or Almost Banned Abortion.** According to Vox, "The
    Women's Health Protection Act would enshrine into federal law the
    right to access and perform an abortion, and it would supersede
    state laws on the issue. That's notable because it would effectively
    neutralize laws in 19 states that have sought to severely curb
    access to abortion or ban it altogether." \[Vox,

-   **The Bill Would Prevent "Medically Unnecessary" Abortion
    Restrictions, Including Mandatory Waiting Periods, Counseling,
    Telemedicine Bans, And Several Policies That Have Forced The Closure
    Of Abortion Clinics.** According to The Washington Post, "The bill
    would eliminate a list of what proponents describe as 'medically
    unnecessary' antiabortion restrictions, including mandatory waiting
    periods, antiabortion counseling, telemedicine bans and various
    regulations on the layout, structure and staffing policies at
    abortion clinics, which have forced many clinics to shutter." \[The
    Washington Post,
    [2/28/22](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/28/abortion-senate-vote/)\]

-   **The Bill Would Ensure Health Care Providers Have The Right To
    Provide Abortions Without Limitations, Including Restrictions Prior
    To Fetal Viability.** According to Reuters, "The Women's Health
    Protection Act, co-sponsored by 48 Senate Democrats, states that
    healthcare providers should be able to provide abortions without a
    number of barriers -- including restrictions on abortions prior to
    fetal viability, which many states currently have in place."

### Defense Department Reproductive Service Reimbursement Policy

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Prohibiting The Defense Department
From Paying Or Reimbursing Abortion-Related Costs.** In June 2024,
Fitzpatrick voted against , according to Congressional Quarterly,
"amendment no. 55 that would prohibit the Defense Department from paying
for or reimbursing certain expenses relating to abortion services." The
vote was on the amendment. The underlying legislation was the FY 2025
National Defense Authorization Act. The House adopted the amendment by a
vote of 214 to 207. \[House Vote 263,

-   **The Amendment Prohibited Reimbursements For Individuals That Had
    To Travel For Abortions.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "The bill is peppered with familiar GOP-favored provisions that
    would bar spending on \[...\] subsidizing troops\' travel to obtain
    abortions." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/14/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-8032798?10)\]

-   **The Amendment Followed A House-Passed Amendment To The FY 2024
    NDAA That Overturned A Defense Memorandum Permitting Reimbursements
    For Travel To Receive Reproductive Care.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The House waded through controversial
    amendments to the fiscal 2024 defense authorization on Thursday,
    adopting multiple provisions that could threaten the bill's final
    passage. \[...\] The House earlier Thursday adopted an amendment
    from Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, to rescind a Defense Department
    policy that reimburses servicemembers who must travel to obtain
    reproductive health care. Democrats have promised to vote en masse
    against the bill if that provision is included." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [7/14/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7791781?18)\]

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted To Prohibit The Use Of VA Funding To Provide
Abortions Or Allow Abortion Counseling.** In July 2023, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Military
Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,
2024, which would "also prohibit the use of the bill\'s funds to provide
abortions, to implement a September 2022 VA rule that allows abortion
counseling and establishes exceptions for the prohibition on abortions
in the medical benefits package for veterans and civilian beneficiaries,
to provide surgical procedures or hormone therapies for gender-affirming
care, and to fly or display a flag over a VA facility or national
cemetery that is not the U.S. flag, military-related or another
government jurisdiction" The vote was on passage. The House passed the
