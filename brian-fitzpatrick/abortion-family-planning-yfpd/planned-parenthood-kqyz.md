**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against An Amendment To The FY 2020 Minibus
That Prohibited The Convening Of An Ethics Advisory Board On Research
Projects That Use Human Fetal Tissue.** In June 2019, Fitzpatrick voted
against an amendment to the FY 2020 minibus that would, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit use of funds made available by the
bill to convene an ethics advisory board on research grants and projects
that propose the use of human fetal tissue." The vote was on adoption of
the amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 225-193.

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Effectively Defunding Planned
Parenthood.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a budget
resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It
would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1
trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at
\$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas
Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and
would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense
account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and
would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into
a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs,
such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was
an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC
budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555,

-   **Budget Called For Defunding Abortion Providers.** According to the
    Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Prohibit Federal Funds
    from Going to Entities that Provide Abortions The federal government
    should not fund entities that provide abortion services. This budget
    ensures that no taxpayer dollars flow to entities that provide
    abortions." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating All Title X Funding For Abortion
    Providers.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018
    Budget, "Eliminate Title X Family Planning Funding Title X, or the
    family planning federal grant program, provides abortion providers
    with federal funds to terminate pregnancies and end the lives of
    thousands of innocent babies. This money has been used by abortion
    providers, like Planned Parenthood, to not only underwrite the
    abortion industry, but it has also been used in support of
    organizations that dismember and sell fetal body parts. Planned
    Parenthood is the largest recipient of Title X grants, which are
    intended to fund valuable health services for low-income women, but
    instead are used by abortion providers to put the safety of women
    and their unborn babies in danger.376 Eliminating Title X would save
    \$286 million per year." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The House GOP's FY 2018 Omnibus That
Defunded Planned Parenthood.** In September 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for
an FY 2018 Omnibus appropriations bill that. According to The Hill, "The
House on Thursday completed its work on the annual appropriations bills
for 2018, ahead of expected negotiations at the end of this year to keep
the government funded. By a vote of 211-198, the House passed a \$1.2
trillion package of spending bills to fund wide swaths of the federal
government, ranging from the Department of Homeland Security to the
Environmental Protection Agency. \[...\] The package included eight new
bills, plus four previously passed appropriations bills that advanced
through the House in July. Regular order for appropriations typically
involved passing each of the bills individually, not in groups of 4 or
8. \[...\] Together, the bills appropriate \$621.5 billion for defense
spending and \$511 billion for nondefense discretionary spending. It
also devotes another \$87 billion in Overseas Contingency Operation
(OCO) funding, which does not count toward budget cuts. Of that, \$75
billion went to defense, \$12 billion to nondefense." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 211 to 198. The Senate
took no substantive action on the overall legislation. \[House Vote 528,

-   **Legislation Defunded Planned Parenthood.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Finally, the measure prohibits funding for
    Planned Parenthood and HHS Title X family planning programs;
    prohibits the use of funds to administer or further implement the
    2010 health care overhaul (the Affordable Care Act, or ACA),
    including by prohibiting the funding of ACA navigators; and it
    includes the text of the Conscience Protection Act, which prohibits
    all levels of government from penalizing, retaliating against or
    otherwise discriminating against a health care provider because the
    provider does not provide or sponsor abortion coverage."

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The American Health Care Act That
Would Have In Part Prohibited Federal Funding To Planned Parenthood.**
In May 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against the American Health Care Act
which would have significantly repealed portions of the Affordable Care
Act by cutting Medicaid, cutting taxes on the rich, removing safeguard
for pre-existing conditions and defunding Planned Parenthood. According
to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "prohibit\[ed\]
federal funding to any entity, such as Planned Parenthood, that performs
abortions and receives more than \$350 million a year in Medicaid
funds." The overall legislation would have in part, also according to
Congressional Quarterly, "ma\[d\]e extensive changes to the 2010 health
care overhaul law, by effectively repealing the individual and employer
mandates as well as most of the taxes that finance the current system.
It would \[have\], in 2020, convert\[ed\] Medicaid into a capped
entitlement that would provide\[d\] fixed federal payments to states and
end\[ed\] additional federal funding for the 2010 law's joint
federal-state Medicaid expansion. \[...\] It would \[have\] allow\[ed\]
states to receive waivers to exempt insurers from having to provide
certain minimum benefits." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 217 to 213. The bill, in modified forms, died in the
Senate. \[House Vote 256,

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Disapprove A Rule That Would Have
Effectively Withheld Title X Funds To States That Restrict Title X Funds
To Planned Parenthood.** In February 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for
disapproving the HHS rule related to Title X funding compliance via the
Congressional Review Act. According to Congressional Quarterly, "This
resolution disapproves the rule issued by the Health and Human Services
Department (HHS) on Dec. 19, 2016, that modifies eligibility
requirements for Title X grants for family planning services to specify
that states and other entities awarding funds cannot prohibit a health
care provider from participating for reasons other than its ability to
provide Title X services (which effectively threatens to withhold Title
X money from states that restrict participation by Planned Parenthood).
The measure provides that the rule (formally titled Compliance With
Title X Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting Subrecipients)
would have no force or effect." The vote was on the resolution. The
House adopted the legislation by a vote of 230 to 188. The legislation
later became law. \[House Vote 99,

-   **HHS Rule Required That States Can Only Deny Funding For A Group
    Based On Its Ability To Provide Title X Services.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "On Dec. 19, 2016, HHS finalized a rule
    modifying eligibility requirements for Title X grants for family
    planning services, which specified that no state or other recipient
    distributing funds can prohibit an entity from participating and
    receiving funds for reasons other than its ability to provide Title
    X services. If states or other entities are found to not be in
    compliance, HHS could discontinue its funding, subject to
    administrative appeals and a recoupment and re-awarding of funds.
    The rule effectively threatens to withhold Title X funds from states
    that have restrictions against participation by Planned Parenthood.
    The final rule became effective on Jan. 18, 2017." \[Congressional
    Quarterly,
    [2/10/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5040651/11?105&search=b6LCd0LZ)\]

-   **Some States Have Attempted To Defund A Portion Of Planned
    Parenthood Funding By Denying Funds Through Title X.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Within the past few years, 13 states have
    taken actions to restrict participation by certain providers under
    the Title X program --- most prominently, Planned Parenthood. HHS
    officials in the Obama administration argued that these actions were
    motivated by politics and not the provider\'s ability to provide
    Title X services, noting that the restrictions caused limitations in
    the geographic distribution of services. Some states have
    implemented a tiered approach to distribute Title X funds that gives
    preference to comprehensive primary care providers or community
    health centers, while others have explicitly prohibited specific
    providers from being eligible to receive Title X funds. Litigation
    concerning these restrictions has led to inconsistency across states
    in how Title X funds are distributed." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/10/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5040651/11?105&search=b6LCd0LZ)\]

-   **Title X Family Planning Is The Only Federal Grant Program
    Dedicated To Family Planning; Program Helps About 4 Million People
    Annually, Including Through Pregnancy Testing And STD Screening.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Title X Family Planning
    Program within the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) was
    enacted in 1970 as part of the Public Health Service Act and remains
    the only federal program focused solely on providing family planning
    services. An estimated 4 million individuals each year receive
    services through thousands of Title X-funded health centers across
    the country, including contraceptive services, pregnancy testing and
    counseling, preconception health services, screening for sexually
    transmitted diseases and certain cancer screenings." \[Congressional
    Quarterly,
    [2/10/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5040651/11?105&search=b6LCd0LZ)\]

-   **Title X Funds Cannot Be Used To Fund Abortion, But Organizations
    That Provide Abortion Services Can Receive Funding.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Current law bars the use of Title X funds
    for abortion, but it allows states that receive grants to award
    funds to nonprofits and other entities to serve as providers for the
    covered family planning services. In some states, Title X service
    providers include members of Planned Parenthood Federation of
    America Inc., a network of clinics that provide contraception and
    preventive health care for women but which is also the largest
    provider of abortion services in the nation." \[Congressional
    Quarterly,
    [2/10/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5040651/11?105&search=b6LCd0LZ)\]

-   **Planned Parenthood Receives About \$60 Million Annually From Title
    X Out Of \$450 Million Annually From The Federal Government.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "For years, abortion opponents
    have been trying to eliminate or restrict federal funding for
    Planned Parenthood. The organization receives roughly \$450 million
    in federal funds each year, with \$390 million coming from Medicaid
    reimbursements and \$60 million coming from Title X."
