# Pregnancy Centers

### Federal Funding

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Prohibit Restrictions On Federal Funding
For Pregnancy Centers.** In January 2024, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the "passage of the bill that would
prohibit limitations on the use of federal Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families funding for pregnancy centers. The bill would prevent the
Health and Human Services secretary from finalizing, implementing or
enforcing policies that discriminate against pregnancy centers seeking
federal funding. It also would define a pregnancy center as any
organization, such as a pregnancy resource center, pregnancy help center
or organization, or pregnancy medical center that supports protecting
the life of the mother and the unborn child, and offers resources and
services to mothers, fathers and families including counseling,
education, pregnancy testing, diapers, baby clothing or material
supports." The vote was on adoption of the rule. The House adopted the
rule by a vote of 214 to 208. \[House Vote 17,

-   **Democrats Opposed Funding Pregnancy Centers Out Of Concern That
    They Mislead Women Seeking Contraception Or Abortion.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The panel also readied for the floor a
    bill (HR 6918), approved by the House Ways and Means Committee, to
    prevent the Health and Human Services Department from establishing
    or enforcing restrictions on federal funding for pregnancy centers,
    which abortion opponents have endorsed as an alternative to abortion
    clinics for providing information on pregnancy care and services.
    Many Democrats argue that these centers can mislead women seeking
    contraception or abortion services." \[Congressional Quarterly,
