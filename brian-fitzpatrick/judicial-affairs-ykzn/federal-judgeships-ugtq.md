# Federal Judgeships

### Authorize New Judgeships

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Authorize 66 New Federal Judgeships.** In
December 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional
Quarterly, "the bill that would authorize the appointment of 66 new
federal judgeships to be phased in from 2025 to 2035. Of the
appointments, 63 would be permanent and three would be temporary. The
measure would authorize a total of \$448 million to implement the
addition of judges and provide staffing through fiscal 2035. The bill
would provide specific amounts for each fiscal year and would enable the
authorizations to increase each year by the rate of annual inflation.
The bill also would specify additional cities for certain federal
district courts in California, Texas and Utah to hold proceedings." The
House passed the bill by a vote of 236 to 173. \[House Vote 501,
