# U.S. Supreme Court

### Police Protection For Justices

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Authorize The Supreme Court Police To
Protect The Family Members Of U.S. Supreme Court Justices Or Any Court
Officer When The Protection Is Deemed Necessary.** In June 2022,
according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Supreme
Court Police Parity Act of 2022, which would "allow the Supreme Court
Police to protect the immediate family members of Supreme Court justices
or any officers of the court if the court\'s marshal deems such
protection necessary." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 396-27, thus the bill was sent to the President and
became law. \[House Vote 261,

-   **The Bill Was In Response To The Protests Happening Outside Of
    Supreme Court Justices' Homes After The Leaked Draft Opinion
    Overturning Roe V. Wade, Including A Man Who Traveled To Justice
    Brett Kavanaugh's House With The Alleged Intent To Kill Him.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The leaked draft opinion
    sparked a wave of protests outside justices' homes, and a California
    man faces charges that he traveled to the Maryland home of Justice
    Brett M. Kavanaugh with an alleged plan to break in and kill him. An
    FBI affidavit said the man was arrested last week with a pistol and
    told a detective he was upset about the recent leaked draft
    decision, as well as an upcoming decision on gun rights."

-   **The Bill Expanded "Round-The-Clock Police Protection" For U.S.
    Supreme Court Justices And Their Immediate Families, Similar To
    Executive And Legislative Officials.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The House voted 396-27 to pass the bill (S 4160) after a
    month of back-and-forth with the Senate over how much to expand
    police protection related to Supreme Court employees. The bill,
    which the Senate passed by unanimous consent last month, would
    provide round-the-clock police protection for Supreme Court justices
    and their families, similar to officials in the executive and
    legislative branches." \[Congressional Quarterly,
