# Third Party Settlements

### Prohibit Third Party Settlement Agreements Involving The U.S Government And A Non-Government Actor

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Ban Third Party Settlement Agreements
Except If The Settlement Is For Restitution To An Affected Party Or Is A
Direct Remedy For Harm.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for
legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"prohibit\[ED\] settlement agreements involving the U.S. government from
requiring the non-governmental party to make a payment or loan to any
party other than the U.S. government. Prohibitions would not \[have\]
appl\[ied\] if the payment or loan under the settlement is for
restitution to affected parties or is a direct remedy for actual harm."
The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 238 to
183. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House

-   **Certain Federal Agencies Have Used Negotiated Settlements To Fund
    Community Service Projects, Such As When JP Morgan Credit Against
    Its Settlement For By Donating To Community Redevelopment
    Organizations.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Beginning in
    the 1980s, various federal enforcement agencies, including the
    Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Nuclear Regulatory Commission
    and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), have wanted to use money
    from negotiated financial settlements to fund community service
    projects. \[...\] Beginning in 2013, the Justice Department entered
    into a number of agreements with large banks to settle issues
    surrounding the banks' mortgage practices. The settlement with JP
    Morgan offered the bank credit against its settlement obligations
    for donations to community redevelopment groups. In 2014,
    settlements with both Citibank and Bank of America required \$150
    million in donations to housing nonprofits. These donations earned
    double credit against the banks' overall obligations. Meanwhile,
    credit for direct forms of consumer relief remained
    dollar-for-dollar." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Opponents Of Third Party Claim That These Settlements Subvert
    Congress' Power Of The Purse.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "Supporters of the bill, primarily Republicans, say
    Congress' power to control spending has been subverted by the
    diversion of monetary settlements from lawsuits to groups favored by
    the executive branch, often in direct contradiction to enacted
    spending bills. They say the Justice Department, in particular, has
    directed settlement dollars to favored groups, and that since those
    payments often counted double toward a settlement (allowing
    defendants to lower their total settlement costs) there was a strong
    incentive for defendants to make them, directly circumventing the
    congressional appropriations process. The Justice Department, they
    say, should focus its existing authority on obtaining redress for
    victims harmed by defendants, and that once those victims have been
    compensated the decision on what to do with any additional funds
    extracted from defendants should be properly decided by Congress."
