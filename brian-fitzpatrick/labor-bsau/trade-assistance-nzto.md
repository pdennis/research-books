# Trade Adjustment Assistance

### Elimination

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating Trade Adjustment
Assistance.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a budget
resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It
would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1
trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at
\$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas
Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and
would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense
account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and
would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into
a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs,
such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was
an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC
budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555,

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating TAA.** According to the Republican
    Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "End Trade Adjustment Assistance
    (TAA) Conservatives believe in free trade. The voluntary trade of
    goods and services between the people of different nations allows
    for a more efficient marketplace that raises the standard of living
    for all. Under the mistaken idea that trade is a bad thing, the
    Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program was created as 'a federal
    entitlement program that assists U.S. workers who have lost or may
    lose reemployment services, income support, and wage insurance to
    eligible workers. According to the Cato Institute, 'one of the most
    important reasons to oppose TAA is that its very existence implies
    that 'damage' is done when trade is liberalized'.370 But, if another
    reason is needed, 'a recent federal evaluation found that TAA hurts
    its beneficiaries' job prospects.'371 Eliminating TAA would save
    about \$861 million each year, while restoring market indicators
    that are more likely to help individuals secure careers in
    successful industries in the long run." \[Republican Study
