# Minimum Wage

**2017: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against Considering Legislation
Raising The Minimum Wage To \$15 Per House In Seven Years.** In June
2017, Fitzpatrick voted for a motion to order the previous question on,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "on the rule (H Res 414) that
would provide for House floor consideration of the bill (HR 3003) that
would prohibit federal, state and local governments from restricting any
federal, state, or local government entity or official from complying
with immigration laws or from assisting federal law enforcement in its
enforcement of such laws." According to the office of Nancy Pelosi, "the
Democratic previous question would amend the rule to allow for
consideration \[sic\] of H.R. 15, the Raise The Wage Act,, \[sic\] which
would give workers the raise they deserve, and increase the federal
minimum wage to \$15 an hour within 7 years." The vote was on the
previous question. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 235 to
190. \[House Vote 331,

-   **Voting Down A Previous Question Allows The Minority Party To
    Decide What Amendments Are To Be Considered.** According to the
    Democratic Leader, "Defeating the previous question gives the
    minority party the opportunity to decide what bill or amendments the
    House will consider. When the motion for the previous question is
    defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the
    opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because
    he or she then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the
    rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment. In essence, defeat of
    the previous question gives the minority party control of the floor
    and of the schedule for the U.S. House of Representatives,
    pertaining to the Rule that is being debated." \[Democratic Leader,

### Increase

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The American Rescue Plan Of 2021,
Which Would Gradually Increase The Federal Minimum Wage To \$15 Per Hour
By 2025, Including For Tipped Workers, Teenage Workers And Workers With
Disabilities.** In February 2021, Fitzpatrick voted against the American
Rescue Plan Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "incrementally increase the federal minimum wage annually to
reach \$15 per hour in 2025, including for tipped workers, teens and
workers with disabilities." The vote was on passage. The House passed
the bill by a vote of 219-212, sent to the Senate and President, and the

-   **Despite Attempts To Increase The Federal Minimum Wage Through The
    American Rescue Plan, The Senate Parliamentarian Said The Provision
    Would Need To Be Stripped.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "A provision that would more than double the federal minimum wage
    must be stripped from the package, based on guidance from the Senate
    parliamentarian." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/26/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6140112?33)\]

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For Raising The Minimum Wage To \$15 Per Hour
By 2025.** In July 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "increase the federal minimum wage
to \$8.40 per hour on the first day of the third month after enactment
and would incrementally increase it annually to reach \$15 per hour six
years after the effective date \[...\] The bill would also increase the
minimum wage for tipped employees, teens, and individuals with
disabilities, with incremental increases over five years until each of
these rates reaches \$15 per hour, at which point the separate minimum
wages would be repealed." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 231-199. \[House Vote 496,

-   **The Minimum Wage Had Not Been Increased Since 2009, The Longest
    Gap Since It Was Established In 1938.** According to the New York
    Times, "The bill would more than double the federal minimum wage,
    which is \$7.25 an hour --- about \$15,000 a year for someone
    working 40 hours a week, or about \$10,000 less than the federal
    poverty level for a family of four. It has not been raised since
    2009, the longest time the country has gone without a minimum-wage
    increase since it was established 1938." \[New York Times,
    [7/18/19](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/us/politics/minimum-wage.html)\]

-   **CBO: A \$15 Minimum Wage Would Cause The Number Of Americans
    Living In Poverty To Decrease, Though It Could Cost Up To 1.3
    Million Jobs.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "A
    Congressional Budget Office report on the bill, released this month,
    said that more than doubling the federal minimum wage to \$15 per
    hour could cost 1.3 million jobs when fully implemented by 2025,
    though millions would see higher wages and the number of Americans
    living in poverty would decrease." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [7/18/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5598697?37)\]

-   **EPI; A \$15 Minimum Wage Would Increase The Annual Wage Of An
    Average Affected Worker By \$2,800.** According to the Economic
    Policy Institute, "such an increase in the federal wage floor would
    lift wages for 33.5 million workers across the country by
    2025---more than one-fifth of the wage-earning workforce. The
    increase would boost total annual wages for these low-wage workers
    by \$92.5 billion, lifting annual earnings for the average affected
    year-round worker by \$2,800." \[Economic Policy Institute,
    [7/17/19](https://www.epi.org/publication/minimum-wage-15-by-2025/)\]

**2019: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted To Exempt Small Businesses With
Less Than 10 Employees Or Under \$1 Million In Profits From Raising The
Minimum Wage To \$15 Per Hour.** In July 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for a
bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "recommit the
bill to the House Education and Labor Committee with instructions to
report it back immediately with an amendment that would exempt from the
bill's requirements businesses that employ fewer than 10 individuals or
that have an annual gross volume of sales and business of less than \$1
million." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the
motion by a vote of 210-218. \[House Vote 495,

-   **Some Democrats Worried That The New Bill Would Disproportionately
    Burden States Or Regions Where The Cost Of Living Is Lower.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Some Democrats felt the
    bill's original five-year time span would be too quick for some
    states or regions where the cost of living is lower. In those areas,
    the spending power of a dollar goes further for consumers, but
    income is lower for regional businesses that would have to pay
    employees the higher wage." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [7/18/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5598697?1)\]

-   **Progressive Democrats Threatened To Vote Against The Bill If
    Moderates Voted For The Motion To Recommit.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "the Democratic-led effort was almost
    derailed by divisions between progressives and moderates.
    Progressives on Wednesday had issued a last-minute warning to
    moderate colleagues not to help Republicans make last-minute changes
    to the bill through the procedural maneuver known as a motion to
    recommit. If moderate Democrats helped the GOP add what the
    progressives considered poison pill language to the measure, members
    of the Congressional Progressive Caucus were prepared to vote
    against it." \[Congressional Quarterly,
