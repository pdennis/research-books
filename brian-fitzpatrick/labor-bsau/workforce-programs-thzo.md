### Reauthorizations

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Reauthorize The Workforce Innovation And
Opportunity Act.** In April 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to
Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would reauthorize
programs in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act through fiscal
2030. In total, it would authorize \$6.3 billion over the next five
years. It would also modify existing WIOA programs, expand certain
program eligibilities, streamline certain administrative requirements,
establish new priorities and performance indicators as well as repurpose
and reallocate funds to support new grant programs and accountability
measures." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote

-   **The Bill Allocated Fifty Percent OF Funding To An Adult And
    Dislocated Worker Program And Allowed States To Establish A
    "Critical Industry Skills Fund".** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "One measure (HR 6655) would reauthorize and update
    programs under a 2014 federal workforce development law. It would
    allocate 50 percent of funding within the adult and dislocated
    worker program for 'individual training accounts,' which would
    provide certain eligible displaced workers with \$5,000 to enroll in
    high-quality reskilling programs, which teach workers a new set of
    skills. It also would emphasize employer-led initiatives by allowing
    states to establish a 'critical industry skills fund' to reimburse
    employers for teaching workers additional skills related to their
    current job, also known as upskilling, among other changes to the
    underlying law." \[Congressional Quarterly,
