# Paycheck Fairness Act

### 2017

**2017: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against Considering The Paycheck
Fairness Act.** In April 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for a motion to order
the previous question on, according to Congressional Quarterly, "the
rule (H Res 240) that would provide for House floor consideration of the
bill that would direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to
increase from \$5 million to \$10 million the annual amount of
securities that privately-held companies can sell for employee
compensation without needing to disclose certain information to
investors." In addition, according to the office of Nancy Pelosi, "the
Democratic previous question would amend the rule to allow for
consideration of H.R. 1869, to address the male to female income
disparity in the united states and make equal pay for women a reality in
the workplace." The vote was the previous question. The House adopted
the motion by a vote of 229 to 187. \[House Vote 213,

-   **Voting Down A Previous Question Allows The Minority Party To
    Decide What Amendments Are To Be Considered.** According to the
    Democratic Leader, "Defeating the previous question gives the
    minority party the opportunity to decide what bill or amendments the
    House will consider. When the motion for the previous question is
    defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the
    opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because
    he or she then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the
    rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment. In essence, defeat of
    the previous question gives the minority party control of the floor
    and of the schedule for the U.S. House of Representatives,
    pertaining to the Rule that is being debated." \[Democratic Leader,

### 2019

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Paycheck Fairness Act, Which Aims To
End Gender-Based Wage Discrimination By Banning Employees From Asking
About Previous Salary, Close Rules Allowing Firms To Fire Workers Who
Discuss Pay, And Require Employers Publish Data With The EEOC.** In
March 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for the Paycheck Fairness Act. According
to Vox, the legislation "works to close loopholes in the landmark Equal
Pay Act of 1963, which required that men and women receive equal pay for
equal work. \[...\] DeLauro's Paycheck Fairness Act tries to push back
on lingering inequity in three key ways. Perhaps most importantly, it
would ban employers from asking candidates how much they made in
previous jobs. It would also get rid of employer rules that keep workers
from talking about their salary information, so that women could ask how
much their coworkers are making and find out if they're underpaid.
Third, the bill would require employers to be much more transparent
about how much they're paying workers. Employers would have to share
salary data with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, so that
body could watch out for potential discriminatory practices." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 242 to 187.

-   **On Average, Women Make Only 80 Cents To The Dollar That Men Earn,
    With Women Of Color Earning Even Less.** According to Majority
    Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD), "Too often, women are paid less than men
    for doing the exact same work. House Democrats passed the Lilly
    Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009 to strengthen worker protections
    against pay discrimination, but additional action is required to
    help close the wage gap. On average, a woman still makes only 80
    cents for every dollar earned by her white male equivalent. The wage
    gap varies based on race and is especially acute for women of color:
    Black women earn 61 cents on average for every dollar earned by her
    white male equivalent; Latina women earn 53 cents; Native Hawaiian
    and Pacific Islander women earn 62 cents; And Asian women earn 85
    cents." \[Press Release From The Office Of Majority Leader Steny
