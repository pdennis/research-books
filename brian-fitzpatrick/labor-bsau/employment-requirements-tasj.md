### Education

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Modernization Of Cybersecurity Experts
Act Which Restricted The Ability Of Agencies To Place Education
Requirements On Cybersecurity Positions.** In September 2023, according
to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the "motion to suspend
the rules and pass the bill that would restrict agencies from
prescribing minimum educational requirements for cybersecurity positions
unless required by the State or locality where the duties are to be
performed. It would also restrict agencies from considering education
when determining whether a candidate meets the minimum qualifications
unless the candidate's education directly reflects the competencies
necessary to satisfy the qualifications of the position. The bill would
require the Office of Personnel Management to annually publish on its
website any changes made to minimum educational qualifications for
cybersecurity positions and data indicating the education level of all
hired cybersecurity workers." The vote was on passage. The House passed
the bill by a vote of 394 to 1, thus the bill was sent to the Senate.
