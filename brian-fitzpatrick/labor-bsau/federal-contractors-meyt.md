### Requiring That Large Contractors Disclose Violations Of Federal Labor Laws

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Disapprove A Rule Requiring That Federal
Contractors That Exceed \$500,000 Disclose If They Were Subject To
Violations Of Federal Labor Laws Or State Laws Within The Previous Three
Years.** In February 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for disapproving a rule via
the Congressional Rule Act that required large federal contractors
disclose violations of federal labor laws via the Congressional Review
Act. According to Congressional Quarterly, "This resolution disapproves
the rule issued by the Defense Department, the General Services
Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on
Aug. 25, 2016, relating to the Federal Acquisition Regulation and
commonly known as the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Rule. The rule
requires that for federal purchases exceeding \$500,000, the offeror
must disclose whether it has been the subject of any violations of 14
specified federal labor laws and equivalent state laws within the
preceding three years, requires federal contractors to provide certain
pay and hours information to all workers on each pay stub and restricts
the automatic use of arbitration clauses. The measure provides that the
rule will have no force or effect." The vote was on the legislation. The
House agreed to the legislation by a vote of 236 to 187. The president
later signed the legislation into law. \[House Vote 76,

-   **The Labor Laws Include The Fair Labor Standards Act, Occupational
    Safety And Health Act, National Labor Relations Act, Davis-Bacon
    Act, Family And Medical Leave Act, Civil Rights Act And Americans
    With Disabilities Act.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Rule requires that for purchases
    exceeding \$500,000, the offeror (the firm bidding to become a
    government contractor) must disclose whether it has been the subject
    of any administrative merits determination, arbitral award or
    decision or civil judgment within the preceding three years for
    violations of 14 specified federal labor laws and equivalent state
    laws. The laws include the Fair Labor Standards Act, Occupational
    Safety and Health Act, National Labor Relations Act, Davis-Bacon
    Act, Family and Medical Leave Act, Civil Rights Act and Americans
    with Disabilities Act, among others. After receiving the award of a
    government contract, prime contractors must provide the labor law
    information to a government database and must update the information
    semi-annually. Prime contractors must make determinations of
    responsibility for prospective subcontractors, as long as the
    subcontracts exceed \$500,000 and are for goods and services other
    than those commercially available off-the-shelf." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [1/27/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5029348/31?5)\]

-   **Rule Also Required That Covered Contractors Provide Certain Pay
    And Hour Information To All Workers And Restricted The Use Of
    Automatic Arbitration Clauses.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The rule includes pay transparency provisions that
    require covered contractors and subcontractors to provide all
    workers with certain information regarding their pay and hours in
    each pay stub. It also restricts the use of arbitration agreements
    for contracts that exceed \$1 million. Arbitration clauses for
    claims arising from civil rights violations, sexual assault or
    harassment can only be invoked with the voluntary consent of the
    employees or independent contractors after the dispute arises under
    the rule." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [1/27/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5029348/31?5)\]

-   **Rule Being Repealed Included Protections For Victims Of Sexual
    Harassment.** According to Politico, "Not long before a deluge of
    sexual harassment claims engulfed Capitol Hill, congressional
    Republicans and President Donald Trump quietly repealed safeguards
    to protect hundreds of thousands of American workers from such
    harassment. Their target was an August 2016 regulation issued by the
    Obama Labor Department that required businesses to disclose certain
    labor violations --- including sexual harassment --- whenever they
    bid on large federal contracts. The vote last year is especially
    relevant now that Congress, under immense public pressure, is
    weighing legislation to outlaw the very same secrecy agreements that
    it voted to keep legal less than a year ago. The regulation in
    question was one of 14 reversed by congressional resolutions that
    Trump signed into law last year as part of his much-touted war
    against 'job-killing regulations.' Besides requiring disclosure, the
    rule forbade the biggest federal contractors from forcing workers to
    take their grievances to arbitration, where employees are likelier
    to lose, than in the courts; in addition, the private proceedings
    are typically kept secret. Mandatory arbitration clauses played a
    key role in keeping secret the sexual harassment settlements that
    piled up over decades at Fox News and elsewhere. Gretchen Carlson,
    who in 2016 settled a sexual harassment complaint against the late
    Fox News chairman Roger Ailes for a reported \$20 million, has made
    the elimination of mandatory arbitration clauses the centerpiece of
    a campaign against sexual harassment." \[Politico,

-   **NOTE TO RESEARCHER.** -- Find companies that would have been
    subject to this rule that the target is a) invested in b) has
    received campaign donations from. \[Congressional Quarterly,
