# Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

### Age Discrimination Study

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Amendment That Would Require The Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission To Conduct A Study To Analyze The
Number Of Filed Claims By People Who May Have Suffered Age
Discrimination During The Job Application Process And Establishing
Recommendations To Address Age Discrimination.** In November 2021,
Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment to the Protect Older Job Applicants
Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to conduct a study, within
one enactment, to determine the number of pending or filed claims,
including claims in closed cases, by individuals who may have been
adversely impacted by age discrimination in the job application process.
It would require the commission to submit to Congress and make publicly
available a report on study results including recommendations for best
practices to address age discrimination in the hiring process." The vote
was on the adoption of an amendment. The House adopted the amendment by
a vote of 225-201. \[House Vote 356,
