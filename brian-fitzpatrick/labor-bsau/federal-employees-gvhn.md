Fitzpatrick voted for giving backpay to federal employees who lost pay
during the government shutdown. According to Congressional Quarterly,
"the bill that would require the federal government to provide
retroactive pay to employees who are furloughed or working without
compensation during the partial government shutdown. The bill would
require federal employees to be compensated at the earliest possible
date once the shutdown has concluded, regardless of regularly scheduled
pay dates." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the
bill. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a
vote of 411 to 7. The Senate had already passed the bill, thereby the
House vote sent the bill to the president, who signed it into law.

    Denied Pay.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The 800,000
    federal workers denied pay during the longest shutdown in modern
    history will eventually get their money. Trump said he would sign a
    bill (S 24) providing retroactive pay to workers who are furloughed
    or forced to work without pay during the shutdown. The House cleared
    the measure Friday by the lopsided margin of 411-7. The Senate
    passed the measure by unanimous consent Thursday night."

### Holman Rule

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Reinstate The 'Holman Rule,' Which Allows
Congress To Reduce The Pay Of Individual Federal Employees.** In January
2017, Fitzpatrick voted for the 2017 House rules which in part
reinstating the 'Holman Rule.' According to the Washington Post, "House
Republicans this week reinstated an arcane procedural rule that enables
lawmakers to reach deep into the budget and slash the pay of an
individual federal worker - down to a \$1 - a move that threatens to
upend the 130-year-old civil service. The Holman rule, named after a
Indiana congressman who devised it in 1876, empowers any member of
Congress to offer an amendment to an appropriations bill that targets a
specific government employee or program. A majority of the House and the
Senate would still have to approve any such amendment but opponents and
supporters agree it puts agencies and the public on notice that their
work is now vulnerable to the whims of elected officials. \[...\] The
Holman provision was approved Tuesday as part of a larger rules package
but received little attention amid the chaos of Republicans' failed
effort to decimate the House ethics office on the first day of the new
Congress." The vote was on the resolution. The House passed the
resolution by a vote of 234 to 193. \[House Vote 6,

### Official Time

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Requiring The Secretary Of Defense To
Submit A Report On The Use Of Official Time.** In June 2024, Fitzpatrick
voted against , according to Congressional Quarterly, "amendment no. 56
that would require the Defense Department to report to Congress on the
use of taxpayer-funded official time." The vote was on the amendment.

Authorization Act. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 188 to
228. \[House Vote 276,

-   **Official Time Allows Union Representatives To Negotiate On Behalf
    Of Federal Employees While On Duty.** According to the American
    Federation Of Government Employees, "Official time is the practice
    in which federal managers and employees work together to make
    government more efficient, productive, and just. The federal
    government is an open shop, meaning employees are not required to
    join the union or pay union dues. But under federal law, unions must
    provide fair representation to all employees at the worksite -- not
    just those who pay dues. In exchange for this legal obligation, the
    Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 allowed federal employee unions to
    bargain with agencies over official time. Under this law, federal
    employees who volunteer as union representatives are permitted to
    use official time to engage in negotiations and perform
    representational duties while on duty status." \[American Federation
    Of Government Employees,

### Prohibiting Federal Workers From Using Official Time For Union Activity

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Prohibiting Federal Employees
From Using Official Time For Union Activity.** In October 2017,
Fitzpatrick voted against a budget resolution that would in part,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new
budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal
2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap
total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and
would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for
fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to
war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of
the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the
Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program.
It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the
U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the
budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget
resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281.

    activity. The OPM estimated that in FY 2012, taxpayers paid more
    than \$157 million in official time for employees to conduct union
    activities." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed

    Quarterly, "As part of the effort to woo support for the measure,

    senior Trump administration officials. The statutory pay freeze for
    Pence, Cabinet officials and other senior White House political
    appointees, which has been in place since 2013, came out of the
    underlying bill once the House adopted the rule (H Res 87) for floor
    debate. Pence, who makes \$230,700 now, and other affected senior
    officials would get the same 2.6 percent raise as other civilian
    workers under Connolly\'s bill, if it becomes law." \[Congressional

    vote adopted clarifying amendments to ensure workers at the Secret
    Service and NASA would get the raise. There were some concerns that
    employees hired under special provisions in the law for hiring at
    those agencies might be excluded." \[Congressional Quarterly,
