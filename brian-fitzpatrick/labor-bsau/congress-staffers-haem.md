# Congressional Staffers

### Federal Employee Paid Leave Act Implementation

**2022: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against Applying Provisions Of The
Family And Medical Leave Act And Fair Labor Standards Act To U.S. House
Staffers, Including 12 Weeks Of Unpaid Parental Leave Or Paid If
Eligible And Including Same-Sex Couples In The Definition Of "Spouse."**
In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick
voted against the "automatic agreement to a resolution (H Res 1516) that
would approve regulatory changes to implement the Federal Employee Paid
Leave Act, applying provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act and
the Fair Labor Standards Act to employees of the House of
Representatives, including to allow employees to take up to 12 weeks of
job-protected unpaid parental leave, or paid leave if eligible, in a
12-month period and to revise the applicable definition of spouse to
include same-sex couples." The vote was on the adoption of the rule and
automatic adoption of the resolution. The House adopted the rule and the
resolution by a vote of 216-206. \[House Vote 521,

-   **The Resolution Provided Aides With The Same Overtime Protections
    Provided To Federal And Private-Sector Workers, Provided The
    Parental Leave Provided To Executive Branch Workers, Included
    Same-Sex Couples In The Definition Of Spouse, And Allowed Staffers
    To Use Federal Leave To Care For Service Members Or Veterans.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The California Democrat's
    resolution implements OCWR regulations that provide aides with the
    same overtime protections as federal and private-sector employees.
    It also implements some updates to FMLA regulations for House
    workers, providing them the same parental leave that Congress gave
    executive branch workers in 2019, revising the definition of a
    spouse to include same-sex couples, and allowing staffers to use
    FMLA leave to care for family members who are active servicemembers
    or veterans in some circumstances." \[Congressional Quarterly,
