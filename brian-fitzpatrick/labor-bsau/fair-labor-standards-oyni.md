# Fair Labor Standards

### Compensatory Time

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Revise Time And A Half Overtime Rules
To Allow Employees To Receive Compensatory Time Instead.** In May 2017,
Fitzpatrick voted against the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2017.
According to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would "allow
private-sector employers to provide non-exempt employees compensatory
time off at a rate of 1.5 hours per hour of overtime work. To be
eligible, employees would be required to have worked at least 1,000
hours in a 12-month period. Employees would be limited to 160 hours of
compensatory time and employers would be required to provide monetary
compensation by Jan. 31, for any unused compensatory time accrued during
the preceding year. The bill's provisions would sunset five years after
enactment." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote
of 229 to 197. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation.

-   **Legislation Would Effectively Allow Employers To Fire Employees
    For Wanting Time And A Half Instead Of Compensatory Time.**
    According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, "The bill
    does not give the employee the right to say they would prefer
    compensatory time for working overtime, it gives this right to the
    employer. In principle the worker is supposed to have the option to
    refuse the offer and say that they would instead prefer their
    overtime pay. However the piece further misleads readers in the
    second paragraph \[...\] There is a big difference between public
    employees and private sector employees. Public sector employees
    cannot be fired at will, while private sector employees can be,
    unless they are covered by a union contract. While this legislation
    in principle protects private sector employees from being coerced
    into accepting time off in lieu of overtime pay, it is difficult to
    see how this could be enforced. An employer can fire anyone for
    almost any reason at any time. While the bill does prohibit an
    employer from firing someone for refusing to take comp time, an
    employer can legally fire someone because their last name begins
    with the letter 'B.' This means that a worker who refuses to accept
    comp time, can be fired over the first letter in their last name.
    This could be contested in court, where the worker would argue that
    the actual reason was their refusal to accept comp time. Perhaps
    they could prove this, but the damages, even when doubled as
    required in the bill, would almost certainly not cover the cost of
    hiring a lawyer." \[Center for Economic and Policy Research,

### Federal Contracts

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Prohibiting Federal Contracts For
Contractors Who Have "Willfully Or Repeatedly" Violated The FLSA.** In
September 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against an amendment that would have,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] funding
appropriated by the bill from being used to enter into contracts with
federal contractors who have willfully or repeatedly violated the Fair
Labor Standards Act." The underlying legislation was a legislative
vehicle for an FY 2018 Omnibus appropriations bill. The House rejected
the amendment by a vote of 191 to 226. \[House Vote 514,
