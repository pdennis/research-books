# Equal Pay

### Bona-Fide Factors

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted To Limit An Employer's Legal Defense In Pay
Discrimination Lawsuits, Which Would Require Employers To Justify A Pay
Difference Based On Bona Fide Job-Related Factors Instead Of Just Based
On A Factor Other Than Sex.** In April 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for the
Paycheck Fairness Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"narrow the legal defense an employer may use in a lawsuit alleging pay
discrimination on the basis of sex. Specifically, it would require
employers to demonstrate that a difference in pay between employees is
based on a business-related 'bona fide factor other than sex, such as
education, training, or experience' as opposed to being based on 'any
factor other than sex.'" The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 217-210. The Senate did not take substantive action on
the bill. \[House Vote 108,

-   **Employers In Wage Discrimination Lawsuits Would Have To Prove
    Their Pay Disparities Were On A "Bona Fide Factor," Not Based On
    Gender.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "It would require,
    in wage discrimination lawsuits, that employers demonstrate that
    differences in pay were not based on gender but on 'a bona fide
    factor,' such as education, training or experience." \[Congressional
    Quarterly,
    [4/13/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/committees-20210413461423?1)\]

-   **The Bill Would Close Federal Equal Pay Law Loopholes.** According
    to Courthouse News Service, "Breathing new life into legislation
    that died in the Senate under the Trump administration, Democrats on
    Tuesday advanced a bill they say would close lingering loopholes in
    federal equal pay laws on the books for nearly 60 years."

    \[Courthouse News Service,

    According to Courthouse News Service, "Republicans claimed a surge
    of new lawsuits would come if the bill were made into law."
    \[Courthouse News Service,
    [4/13/21](https://www.courthousenews.com/democrats-renew-push-for-equal-pay-legislation/)\]

-   **The Bill Would Expand The Standards Employers Must Meet In Order
    To Justify Pay Gaps Were Not Based On Gender Discrimination.**
    According to Courthouse News Service, "The legislation raises the

    aren't based on discrimination." \[Courthouse News Service,
    [4/13/21](https://www.courthousenews.com/democrats-renew-push-for-equal-pay-legislation/)\]

-   **National Right To Life Warned That The Paycheck Fairness Act Could
    Be Construed To Mandate Employers To Cover Elective Abortions With
    Their Health Benefits.** According to the Scorecard Letter on H.R. 7
    from National Right To Life, "While the legislation is meant to
    address potential discrimination regarding the gender pay gap, the
    legislation contains language that could be construed to require
    employers to cover elective abortion in their healthcare benefits."
    \[Scorecard Letter On H.R. 7 -- National Right To Life,
    [6/8/21](https://www.nrlc.org/federal/ahc/nrlc-scorecard-letter-on-h-r-7-paycheck-fairness-act/)\]

-   **Since H.R. 7 Changed The Definition Of "Sex" To Include
    "Pregnancy, Childbirth, Or A Related Medical Condition" Without
    Preventing Funding For Abortion, National Right To Life Claimed That
    H.R. 7 Could Be Used To Sue Employers That Refuse To Provide
    Elective Abortion Coverage.** According to the Scorecard Letter on
    H.R. 7 from National Right To Life, "H.R. 7 makes definitional
    changes to 'sex' to include 'pregnancy, childbirth, or a related
    medical condition.' It is well established that abortion will be
    regarded as a 'related medical condition.' See 29 C.F.R. pt. 1604
    App. (1986) and Doe v. CARS Protection Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 358 (3d
    Cir. 2008). Historically, when Congress has addressed discrimination
    based on sex, rules of construction have been added to prevent
    requiring funding of abortion. Since there is no rule of
    construction that would make this legislation abortion-neutral, it
    is likely that H.R. 7 could be used to sue employers for a lack of
    elective abortion coverage." \[Scorecard Letter On H.R. 7 --
    National Right To Life,
    [6/8/21](https://www.nrlc.org/federal/ahc/nrlc-scorecard-letter-on-h-r-7-paycheck-fairness-act/)\]

-   **National Right To Life Warned That Under The Paycheck Protection
    Act, If An Employer Provides Male-Specific Health Coverage, A Person
    Could Claim Discrimination If The Employer Failed To Provide
    Abortion Coverage.** According to the Scorecard Letter on H.R. 7
    from National Right To Life, "Under H.R. 7, if an employer provides
    health coverage for male-specific items, a person could make a claim
    that an employer's failure to provide health coverage for abortion
    is discriminatory." \[Scorecard Letter On H.R. 7 -- National Right
    To Life,

**2021: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against The Paycheck Fairness
Act.** In April 2021, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick
voted against the "adoption of the rule that would provide for House

-   **Since H.R. 7 Changed The Definition Of "Sex" To Include
    "Pregnancy, Childbirth, Or A Related Medical Condition" Without
    Preventing Funding For Abortion, National Right To Life Claimed That
    H.R. 7 Could Be Used To Sue Employers That Refuse To Provide
    Elective Abortion Coverage.** According to the Scorecard Letter on
    H.R. 7 from National Right To Life, "H.R. 7 makes definitional
    changes to 'sex' to include 'pregnancy, childbirth, or a related
    medical condition.' It is well established that abortion will be
    regarded as a 'related medical condition.' See 29 C.F.R. pt. 1604
    App. (1986) and Doe v. CARS Protection Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 358 (3d
    Cir. 2008). Historically, when Congress has addressed discrimination
    based on sex, rules of construction have been added to prevent
    requiring funding of abortion. Since there is no rule of
    construction that would make this legislation abortion-neutral, it
    is likely that H.R. 7 could be used to sue employers for a lack of
    elective abortion coverage." \[Scorecard Letter On H.R. 7 --

-   **National Right To Life Warned That Under The Paycheck Protection
    Act, If An Employer Provides Male-Specific Health Coverage, A Person
    Could Claim Discrimination If The Employer Failed To Provide
    Abortion Coverage.** According to the Scorecard Letter on H.R. 7
    from National Right To Life, "Under H.R. 7, if an employer provides
    health coverage for male-specific items, a person could make a claim
    that an employer's failure to provide health coverage for abortion
    is discriminatory." \[Scorecard Letter On H.R. 7 -- National Right

### U.S. Athletes In Global Competitions

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require Equal And Non-Discriminatory Pay
For Male And Female Athletes That Represent The U.S. In International
Athletic Competitions.** In December 2022, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Equal Pay for Team USA Act of 2022,
which would "require the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee to ensure
that female and male athletes who represent the United States in
international amateur athletic events receive, from funds directly
provided by the committee to the athlete, equivalent and
nondiscriminatory compensation, wages, benefits, medical care, travel
arrangements and expense payments. It would specify that the committee
may consider merit, performance, seniority or quantity of play in
determining contracts or other terms of participation, and may provide
more beneficial terms to athletes to address disparities in outside
income. It would require the committee to take 'all reasonable steps' to
advocate to international sports federations to equalize athlete
compensation and regularly report to Congress on the equal treatment of
athletes, including information on the stipends and bonuses provided to
athletes disaggregated by gender, race and status of participation on a
professional sports team." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 350 -- 59, thus the bill was sent to President Biden
and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 532,

    Sports, Which Was A Long-Time Battle For The U.S. Women's Soccer
    Team.** According to the Associated Press, "The House has passed a
    bill that ensures equal compensation for U.S. women competing in
    international events, a piece of legislation that came out of the
    U.S. women's soccer team's long battle to be paid as much as the
    men." \[Associated Press,

-   **The Bill Required All Athletes Representing The U.S. In
    International Competitions To Receive Equal Compensation And
    Benefits, Regardless Of Gender, And Instructed The U.S. Olympic And
    Paralympic Committee To Oversee Fair Pay.** According to the
    Associated Press, "The Equal Pay for Team USA Act, passed late
    Wednesday, will require all athletes representing the United States
    in global competition to receive equal pay and benefits in their
    sport, regardless of gender. It covers America's 50-plus national
    sports and requires the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee to
    handle oversight." \[Associated Press,

### Workers' Rights

**2021: Fitzpatrick Was Absent During A Vote On An Amendment That Would
Mandate Employers To Disclose Workers' Rights Through Both Physical And
Online Publications.** In April 2021, Fitzpatrick missed a vote on en
bloc amendments no.1 to the Paycheck Fairness Act which would, according
to Congressional Quarterly, "require employers to inform employees of
their rights under the bill\'s provisions through physical and
electronic postings." The vote was on adoption of amendments. The House
adopted the amendments by a vote of 216-207. \[House Vote 106,
