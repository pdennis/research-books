# National Labor Relations Board

### Elimination

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating The NLRB.** In
October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a budget resolution that would
in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9
trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the
budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10
years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for
fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations
funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate
funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would
assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert
Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block
grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social
Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be
included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House
GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of
139 to 281. \[House Vote 555,

-   **Budget Resolution Called For Eliminating The NLRB.** According to
    the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Eliminate the
    National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) The Department of Justice
    (DOJ) already oversees a wide variety of civil, criminal, and
    administrative issues, including anti-trust and voting rights. DOJ
    is certainly capable of handling claims of unfair labor practices
    and could do so without the pro-union bias and partisanship endemic
    to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Eliminating the NLRB
    beginning in FY 2018 would save \$294 million per year, while in no
    way diminishing the effective implementation of federal labor laws."

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted To Expand Enforcement From The National Labor

    And Imposed Several Civil Monetary Penalties, Including Fees Up To
    \$50K Against Employers Who Punish Organized Labor.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "authorize the NLRB to enforce any orders
    it issues and to impose a number of civil monetary penalties,
    including penalties of up to \$50,000 against employers who prevent
    or punish organizing activities by employees." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [3/9/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/70?16)\]

    Union Election Interference Of Employers And Worker's Rights
    Violations, And Facilitating Initial Collective Bargaining
    Agreements.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure
    would make numerous changes to the National Labor Relations Act
    aimed at bolstering union strength, including adding penalties for
    employees that violate worker rights under the law, prohibiting
    employer interference in union elections, and increasing
    facilitation of initial collective bargaining agreements."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/8/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/committees-20210308458959?18)\]

-   **Advocates Argued That Requiring Fees From Employers That Violate
    Labor Laws During An Organizing Campaign Would Be Critical To
    Facilitating The Formation Of A Union.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "Among the bill's provisions is one that supporters
    consider crucial to making it easier to form a union: the ability to
    require financial payments from employers that break labor laws
    during an organizing campaign. Another provision related to
    organizing campaigns would ban company practices to discourage
    employees from joining a union." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/18/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6225826?19)\]

-   **The Bill Would Impose Monetary Penalties For Employers And
    Executives, Including Corporate Directors And Company Officers, That
    Violate Employees' Rights.** According to NPR, "It would establish
    monetary penalties for companies and executives that violate
    workers' rights. Corporate directors and other officers of the
    company could also be held liable." \[NPR,
    [3/9/21](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/09/975259434/house-democrats-pass-bill-that-would-protect-worker-organizing-efforts)\]

-   **The Bill Would Have Required The NLRB To Seek Temporary Injections
    Against Employers Charged For Enacting Unfair Labor Practices And
    Permitted Workers To Sue If The Board Failed To Seek The
    Injunctions.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "require the
    NLRB to seek temporary injunctions against employers charged with
    engaging in unfair labor practices and allow employees to bring
    civil action if the board fails to seek an injunction."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/9/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/70?16)\]

-   **The Bill Would Have Modified The Definitions Of "Employee" And
    "Supervisor" To Narrow The Categorization Of Independent Contractors
    And Supervisors.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "modify
    definitions of 'employee' and 'supervisor,' particularly to narrow
    the classification of independent contractors and supervisors, two
    categories of employees not eligible for collective bargaining."

### Funding

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Cutting NLRB Funding By \$99
Million.** In September 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against an amendment
that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "decrease\[d\]
the salaries and expenses of the National Labor Relations Board by \$99
million and would transfer the savings to the spending reduction
account." The underlying legislation was a legislative vehicle for an FY
2018 Omnibus appropriations bill. The House rejected the amendment by a

Employer Status Rule.** In January 2024, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for "passage over President Joe Biden\'s
veto of the joint resolution (H J Res 98) disapproving a National Labor

-   **The Rule Expanded The Definition Of Joint Employers For Union
    Bargaining Purposes.** According to Congressional Quarterly, the
    resolution would disapprove of "the October 2023 National Labor
    Relations Board rule that defines a joint employer to include any
    entity that possesses the authority to determine the essential
    employment terms and conditions of another employer\'s employees,
    regardless of whether it actually exercises such authority. The rule
    requires a joint employer to bargain with its employees\' union
    representative with respect to any employment term or condition it
    possesses the authority to control. Under the provisions of the
    joint resolution, the October 2023 NLRB rule would have no force or
    effect." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [1/12/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/10?21)\]

    Membership, While Republicans Believed It Gave Unions Too Much

    argued that the bill would help increase union membership,
    Republicans, who oppose the measure, say it gives too much power to
    unions." \[Congressional Quarterly,
