**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Providing Paid Family and Medical
Leave For Up To Four Weeks Per Year, Starting In 2024.** In November
2021, Fitzpatrick voted against the Build Back Better act which would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "establish a paid family and

The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 220-213.
