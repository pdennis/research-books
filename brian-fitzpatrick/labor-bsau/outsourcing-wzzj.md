### Disclosure Of Employees Location

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Making It More Difficult For Publicly
Traded Companies To Hide Offshoring Jobs.** In October 2019, Fitzpatrick
voted against a bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"require publicly traded companies to disclose the total number and
percentage of their employees who are based in each state, U.S.
territory, and foreign country. It would require such information
disclosed to be disaggregated by state, territory, or country and to
include percentage changes from the company\'s last annual report. It
would exempt small and new 'emerging growth' companies from the bill\'s
disclosure requirements. It would authorize SEC rulemaking authority to
implement the bill\'s provisions." The vote was passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 226-184. The bill was never taken up in the
Senate. \[House Vote 567,
