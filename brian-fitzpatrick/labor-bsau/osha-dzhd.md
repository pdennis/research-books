### Beryllium Exposure

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Amendment To The FY 2020 Minibus That
Would Prohibit OSHA From Changing The Permissible Exposure Standards For
Beryllium.** In June 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration from using any funds authorized in the bill to
finalize or implement a proposed rule that would change the permissible
exposure standards for construction and maritime workers occupationally
exposed to beryllium." The vote was on adoption of the amendment. The
House adopted the amendment by a vote of 241-181. \[House Vote 258,

### Workplace Violence

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For Requiring OSHA To Develop A Comprehensive
Workplace Violence Prevention Plan For Workers In The Health Care And
Social Service Industries.** In November 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for a
bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration to issue a final workplace
violence prevention standard that would require employers in the health
care and social service industries to develop and implement
comprehensive plans to prevent and protect employees from violent
incidents at work \[...\] The bill's provisions would apply to employers
of any individuals who work in certain health care facilities --
including hospitals, nursing homes, or drug abuse treatment centers --
or individuals who provide certain services -- including home-based
health care or social work and emergency services." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 251-158. \[House Vote

-   **Republicans Opposed The Bill Citing Government Overreach.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Some Republicans argued that
    the bill would result in a regulatory overreach. 'Republicans
    expressed concerns that it would force OSHA to use a shortened
    regulated process that would not be appropriate,' said \[Rep. Tom\]
    Cole. \[Rep. Bradley\] Byrne said he was also concerned about the
    bill 'going too far and providing rigid guidelines' \[...\] the
    administration has indicated that President Donald Trump would veto
    the bill, in its current form." \[Congressional Quarterly,
