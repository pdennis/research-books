### Merger Filing Fees

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted For The FY 2023 Omnibus Spending Package,
Which Included The Filing Fee Modernization Act And Increased Filing
Fees For Larger Merger Transactions.** In December 2022, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted to concur with the Senate
amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, which would
"modify filing fees for business merger transactions to generally
increase fees for larger mergers." The vote was on a motion to concur.
The House concurred with the Senate amendment by a vote of 225-201, thus
bill was sent to President Biden and ultimately became law. \[House Vote

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Increase Filing Fees For Merger
Transactions Up To \$2.25 Million Based On The Value Of The Transaction
And Provide For Annual Increases To The Filing Fees Based On
Inflation.** In September 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022,
which would "modify filing fees for merger transactions to generally
increase fees for larger mergers. Specifically, it would increase the
number of filing fee tiers from three to six, with fees ranging from
\$30,000 to \$2.25 million based on the transaction value. It would
provide for annual increases to the fee amounts based on inflation
rates, while adjustments to threshold ranges would continue to be based
on the percentage change in the U.S. gross domestic product. It would
require the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department to jointly
report to Congress on fees received; require the FTC to report on any
actions taken by a 3-2 vote, along with the overall percentage of
actions decided on a 3-2 vote; and require entities to disclose in their
premerger notification filings a detailed accounting of any economic
support they received from a foreign state. The bill would also prohibit
the transfer and consolidation in federal court of antitrust cases that
are brought by states." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 242-184. The Senate did not take substantive action on
the bill. \[House Vote 460,
