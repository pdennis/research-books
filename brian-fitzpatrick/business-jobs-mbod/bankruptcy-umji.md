### Small Business Bankruptcy Relief Extensions

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted For Extending Bankruptcy Protections Through
March 27, 2022 That Remove Consideration Of Pandemic Relief Payments
From Monthly Income And Increasing The Maximum Debt To \$7.5 Million For
A Business To Qualify For Subchapter V Bankruptcy Proceedings.** In
March 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for the COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief
Extension Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"extend through March 27, 2022, certain bankruptcy relief provisions for
small businesses established by the fiscal 2021 omnibus appropriations
and coronavirus relief package (HR 133 / PL 116-260), including to
extend protections that exclude pandemic relief payments from monthly
income with respect to bankruptcy proceedings and extend a provision
raising to \$7.5 million the maximum debt a business may have to be
eligible for Subchapter V bankruptcy proceedings allowing a small
business to restructure to pay down its debt." The vote was on passage.
The House passed the bill by a vote of 399-14, sent to the Senate and
the President, and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 88,
