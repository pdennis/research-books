### Requiring Government Agencies To Use Items Made In America

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Congressional Progressive
Caucus's Budget Resolution, Which Among Other Things, Increased Taxes On
The Rich And Corporations And Called For Closing Loopholes To Require
Government Agencies To Use Items Made In America.** In October 2017,
Fitzpatrick voted against an FY 2018 CPC budget resolution. According to
Congressional Quarterly, the resolution would "provide for \$3.8
trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018, not including
off-budget accounts. It would raise overall spending by \$3.5 trillion
over 10 years and would increase revenues by \$8.2 trillion over the
same period through policies that would increase taxes for corporations
and high-income individuals. It would repeal the Budget Control Act
sequester and caps on discretionary spending, would modify the tax code
by adding five higher marginal tax rates, would create a public
insurance option to be sold within the current health insurance
exchanges and would call for implementation of comprehensive immigration
overhaul." In addition, according to the Congressional Progressive
Caucus, "Closes loopholes so our government agencies use materials made
in America." The amendment was a substitute amendment for the GOP's FY
2018 budget resolution in part designed to start the process for tax
reform. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 108 to 314.
