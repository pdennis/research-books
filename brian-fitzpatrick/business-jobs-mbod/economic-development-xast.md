### Appalachian Regional Commission

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating The Appalachian
Regional Commission.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a
budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal
2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by
\$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending
at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas
Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and
would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense
account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and
would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into
a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs,
such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was
an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC
budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555,

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating Regional Commissions, Including The
    Appalachian Regional Commission.** According to the Republican Study
    Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Eliminate Regional Commissions The RSC
    budget recommends cutting regional commissions including the Denali
    Commission, Appalachian Regional Commission, the Northern Border
    Regional Commission, the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, and
    the Delta Regional Authority. These economic development programs
    are duplicative of other programs and spend federal funding for
    local projects. Not only is the federal government out of money, but
    also it is ill-equipped to adequately prioritize local
    infrastructure and development projects. These activities are also
    more appropriately carried out by state and local governments.
    Beginning in FY 2018 the commissions should be eliminated, saving
    the taxpayers \$198 million per year. The president's Budget
    Blueprint proposes to eliminate these duplicative agencies."
