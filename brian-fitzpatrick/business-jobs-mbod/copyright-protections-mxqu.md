# Copyright Protections

### Privately Developed Standards

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Establish That Private Organizations That
Develop Standards That Are Incorporated Into Law Maintain Copyright
Protection If The Standard Is Publically Accessible And Free.** In July
2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the
bill, as amended, that would establish that private standards
development organizations retain their copyright protection when the
standard is 'incorporated by reference' into a federal, state or local
law or regulation as long as the organization makes the standard
publicly accessible online free of charge. It would specify that a party
challenging a standards development organization's failure to comply
with the bill's public access requirements would bear the burden of
proof. It would allow the website of standards development organizations
to require that users create an account or agree to terms of service to
access certain material, so long as there is no monetary cost to the
user. It would also require several reports to Congress on various
aspects of implementing the bill." The vote was on passage. The House
rejected the bill by a vote of 248 to 127. \[House Vote 357,
