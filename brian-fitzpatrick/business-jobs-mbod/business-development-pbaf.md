### Supporting Minorities

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Providing \$6.6 Billion To Support
Underrepresented Individuals And Minorities With Business Initiation.**
In November 2021, Fitzpatrick voted against the Build Back Better act
which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide \$6.6

Development Agency to help underrepresented individuals with business
development." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
