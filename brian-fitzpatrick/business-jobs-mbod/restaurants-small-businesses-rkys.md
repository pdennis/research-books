# Restaurants And Small Businesses

### COVID-19 Aid

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Provide \$55 Billion In Financial
Assistance To Restaurants And Small Businesses Impacted By The
Coronavirus Pandemic, Including A \$42 Billon Increase To The Restaurant
Revalidation Fund And \$13 Billion For A New Program To Provide
Assistance To Small Businesses.** In April 2022, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Restaurant
Revitalization Fund Replenishment Act of 202, which would "provide \$55
billion for Small Business Administration financial assistance to
restaurants and small businesses that lost revenue due to the COVID-19
pandemic. Specifically, it would increase from \$28.6 billion to \$70.6
billion funding provided for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund
established by previous coronavirus relief law (PL 117-2). It would
provide \$13 billion for a new Hard Hit Industries Award Program to
provide financial assistance payments to small businesses that
experienced at least a 40 percent revenue loss due to the pandemic. It
would specify that funds for the new program would be awarded in amounts
equal to such losses, up to \$1 million, and may be used for business
expenses including payroll costs, certain payments to contractors, rent,
mortgages, maintenance costs, pandemic-related health measures and paid
sick leave. Among other provisions, it would require the SBA to
prioritize applicants that have experienced revenue losses of at least
80 percent, followed by those with revenue losses of at least 60
percent. As an offset, the bill would provide for the recapture of
unobligated funds provided by previous coronavirus relief laws and
administered by the SBA, including funds rescinded or otherwise returned
from the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan
program. It would also extend, through at least March 11, 2023, the time
period within which expenses may be covered under the SBA grant program
for operators of live-performance venues closed due to the pandemic."
The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 223-203,
thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 123,

-   **The Bill Would Provide \$42 Billion For Struggling Food And
    Beverage Establishments After The Revitalization Fund Ran Out Of
    Money In 2021, And The Bill Would Add \$13 Billion To Help Small
    Businesses, Regardless Of Industry, That Suffered At Least 40% Of
    Losses During The Pandemic, With Grant Caps Of \$1 Million Each.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House legislation would
    provide \$42 billion to replenish a fund for struggling restaurants,
    food trucks, bars, caterers, brewpubs, bakeries and more after the
    money ran dry quickly last year. The measure would tack on another
    \$13 billion for small businesses that suffered revenue losses of at
    least 40 percent during the pandemic, without regard to what
    industries they operate in, with grants capped at \$1 million each."

-   **The American Rescue Plan Act Of 2021 Provided \$28.6 Billion In
    Pandemic Relief For Restaurants, But Only One-Third Of Applicants
    Were Able To Receive Funding Before The Fund Ran Out.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Congress provided \$28.6 billion for
    restaurants in pandemic relief legislation last year (PL 117-2), but
    only one-third of those that applied were able to receive a grant
    before funding ran out. Velázquez, D-N.Y., said 177,000 applicants
    were left out as a result." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [4/7/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6507270?11)\]

-   **The House Bill Included A Prohibition On The Financial Assistance
    On Businesses With Wage Violations.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "Unlike in the House, the Senate bill doesn't include a
    prohibition on aid to businesses with violations of wage laws on
    their books, which was a demand of progressives like Rep. Rashida
    Tlaib, D-Mich." \[Congressional Quarterly,
