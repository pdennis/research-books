### Elimination

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating And Replacing The
IRS.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a budget resolution
that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for
\$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance
the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over
10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion
for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency
Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would
incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense
account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and
would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into
a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs,
such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was
an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC
budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555,

-   **Legislation Called For Eliminating The IRS And Replacing It With
    Something Else.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY
    2018 Budget, "This budget takes the bold step of calling for the
    complete elimination of the IRS. Tax collection and enforcement
    activities would be moved to new, smaller, and more accountable
    departments at the Treasury focused on service for the taxpayers,
    including a family and individual unit, a business unit, and an
    independent dispute resolution unit. Applicants to the new
    department would need to undergo a rigorous evaluation of their work
    performance before being hired to positions of trust, and would be
    subject to discipline and termination if they failed to honor that
    trust. This fresh start is necessary to reassure Americans that the
    agency with access to every paycheck is trustworthy and honest."

### Funding

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Cutting The IRS's Operations Budget By
\$165,300.** In September 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against an amendment
that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "decrease\[d\]
funding for Internal Revenue Service operations support by \$165,300,
and would transfer the savings to the spending reduction account." The
underlying legislation was an FY 2018 omnibus. The House rejected the
amendment by a vote of 186 to 223. \[House Vote 519,
