### Disaster Victims

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Exempt Relief Payments To Recent Wildfire
Victims And Victims Of The East Palestine Train Derailment From Taxes.**
In May 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional
Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would provide tax relief for
individuals impacted by recent disasters, including for personal
casualty losses as well as for compensation payments for certain
wildfire losses and for losses associated with the February 2023
derailment of a freight train in East Palestine, Ohio. Specifically, it
would exempt wildfire relief payments, for expenses not compensated for
by insurance, received between 2020 and 2025 and East Palestine train
derailment payments received on or after Feb. 3, 2023, from taxable
gross income." The House passed the bill by a vote of 382 to 7. \[House
