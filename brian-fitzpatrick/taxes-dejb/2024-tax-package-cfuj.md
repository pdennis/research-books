# 2024 Tax Package

### Passage

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted For The 2024 Tax Package That Provided
Business And Family Tax Relief.** In January 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for
, according to Congressional Quarterly, the "bill, as amended, that
would extend and expand certain business tax incentives and the Child
Tax Credit (both through 2025) while boosting credits for building
affordable housing, providing tax relief to victims of natural
disasters, and extending tax treaty-like benefits to Taiwan.
Specifically, it would increase the maximum \$2,000 child tax credit for
inflation for the tax years of 2024 and 2025. Beginning in 2023, the
bill also would increase the amount that is refundable each year while
allowing families to base the tax credit on the prior year\'s income. It
also would raise the maximum refundable amount per child to \$1,800 for
tax year 2023, \$1,900 for tax year 2024, and \$2,000 for tax year 2025.
The bill also would provide additional tax relief for people impacted by
natural disasters by allowing special rules for claiming an itemized
deduction for a personal casualty loss\--rules that went into effect in
early 2021\--to be applied to subsequent natural disasters. It would
increase the 9 percent ceiling for low-income housing tax credit
allocations by 12.5 percent and reduce the bond-financing requirements
from 50 percent to 30 percent for projects financed by bonds issued
before 2026. It would extend through 2025, the 'bonus depreciation'
provision in the 2017 tax law that allowed 100 percent of the cost of an
asset (except structures) to be deducted in the year the asset is placed
in service. The bill also would reinstate through 2025 the ability of
businesses to expense 100 percent of research and experimentation costs
in the year they occur. It would retroactively apply this authority to
2022, the year the 2017 tax law required businesses to start taking
deductions for those costs over five years. It would permanently
increase both the maximum amount a business can deduct for first-year
depreciation of assets, and the threshold at which businesses must
report what they pay contractors and subcontractors. It would exempt
wildfire relief payments received between 2020 and 2025 and East
Palestine train derailment payments received on or after Feb. 3, 2023
from taxable gross income. It also would offset the estimated \$79
billion cost of tax changes by terminating the COVID-19 era Employee
Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) program for any claims filed after Jan. 31,
2024 and increase penalties on under-reporting of the credit. It also
would create a new section of the tax code to provide Taiwan citizens,
residents, corporations, partnership, trusts and estates with benefits
similar to a typical tax treaty. The provisions would apply only if
Taiwan extends the same benefits to U.S. residents and businesses
operating in Taiwan." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill
by a vote of 357 to 70, thus, it was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote

-   **Some Republicans Opposed The Bill For Its Retention Of The
    \$10,000 Cap And State And Local Tax Deductions As Well As The
    Possibility For Undocumented Immigrants To Receive The Child Tax
    Credit.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Blue-state
    Republicans have criticized the Smith-Wyden package for leaving in
    place the \$10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, while the
    potential for undocumented immigrants to access the child credit has
    been a sticking point for House Freedom Caucus members."
