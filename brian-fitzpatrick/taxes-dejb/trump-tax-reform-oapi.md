# Trump Tax Reform

### 2018 Permanent Extension

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For Permanently Extending The Expiring
Provisions Of The 2017 Trump Tax Cuts.** In September 2018, Fitzpatrick
voted for a bill that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"ma\[d\]e permanent a number of tax provisions that would otherwise
expire in 2025. The provisions from the 2017 tax overhaul (PL 115-97)
that would \[have\] become permanent include: reduced tax rates and
modified tax bracket breakpoints for the seven tax brackets, the
standard deduction amount, the elimination of personal exemptions for
each taxpayer and dependent, and the increased child tax credit." The
House passed the bill by a vote of 220 to 191. The Senate took no
substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 414,
[9/28/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll414.xml); Congressional
Quarterly, [9/28/18](http://cq.com/vote/2018/H/414?4); Congressional
Actions, [H.R.
6760](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6760/all-actions)\]

-   **CBO: Bill Would Increase The Deficit By \$631 Billion Over The
    Next Ten Years.** According to the Congressional Budget Office,
    \"The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that
    enacting the bill would reduce revenues by about \$597 billion over
    the 2019-2028 period, and increase outlays by \$34 billion over the
    same period, leading to an increase in the deficit of \$631 billion
    over the next 10 years. A portion of the changes in revenues would
    be from Social Security payroll taxes, which are off-budget.
    Excluding the estimated \$687 million increase in off-budget
    revenues over the next 10 years, JCT estimates that H.R. 6760 would
    increase on-budget deficits by about \$632 billion over the period
    from 2019 to 2028. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply because enacting
    the legislation would affect direct spending and revenues.\"

-   **TPC: Bill Would Reduce Federal Revenues By \$3.2 Trillion From
    2029 To 2038.** According to the Tax Policy Center, \"The bill would
    reduce federal revenues by \$631 billion within the budget window
    (fiscal years 2019--28) and by almost \$3.2 trillion over the
    subsequent decade (fiscal years 2029--38).\"

-   **CBPP: The Top 1 Percent Would Get An Average Tax Cut Of More Than
    \$40,000, While The Bottom 60 Percent Would Get An Average Tax Cut
    Of Just \$480.** According to the Center on Budget and Policy
    Priorities, \"The 2.0 tax plan would exacerbate that trend by
    delivering about twice the after-tax income gain for the top 1
    percent than it would for households in the bottom 60 percent. (See
    Chart 2.) It would give an average tax cut of \$40,180 to households
    in the top 1 percent (those with incomes above \$836,200 in 2026),
    raising their after-tax incomes by 2.0 percent, compared to an
    average tax cut of just \$480 and a 1.1 percent boost in after-tax
    income for households in the bottom 60 percent (those with incomes
    below \$95,000).\"

### Budget Resolution

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The GOP FY 2018 Budget Resolution,
Which Started The Process Towards Tax Reform Which Could Reduce The
Deficit By \$.5 Trillion Over Ten Years.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick
voted against a budget resolution that would have, according to The
Hill, "The spending blueprint is key to Republicans' efforts to pass tax
reform because it includes instructions that will allow the plan to
avoid a Democratic filibuster. \[...\] The budget, meant to outline
spending for the fiscal year, was widely viewed as a mere vehicle for
passing tax reform. \[...\] The budget would allow the Senate GOP's tax
plan to add up to \$1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade, a
proposal that has raised concerns with fiscal hawks in the GOP. Its
instructions call for the Senate Finance Committee to report a tax bill
by Nov. 13. Still, the document outlines the Senate GOP's political
vision. It maintains spending at 2017 levels for the year, but would
then cut nondefense spending in subsequent years, leading to a \$106
billion cut in 2027. It would also allow defense levels to continue
rising at their current rates, reaching \$684 billion at the end of a
decade. The resolution also proposes \$473 billion in cuts to Medicare's
baseline spending over a decade and about \$1 trillion from Medicaid,
though those provisions are not enforceable without additional
legislation." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate
amendment. The House agreed to the motion, thereby agreeing to the
budget by a vote of 216 to 212. \[House Vote 589,

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The House GOP FY 2018 Budget
Resolution, Which Started The Process Towards Tax Reform And Called For
Ending Medicare As We Know It.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted
against the House GOP FY 2018 budget resolution. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "Adoption of the concurrent resolution that
would provide for \$3.2 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018,
not including off-budget accounts. It would assume \$1.22 trillion in
discretionary spending in fiscal 2018. It would assume the repeal of the
2010 health care overhaul law. It also would propose reducing spending
on mandatory programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and changing
programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (also
known as food stamps). It would call for restructuring Medicare into a
'premium support' system beginning in 2024. I would also require the
House Ways and Means Committee to report out legislation under the
budget reconciliation process that would provide for a revenue-neutral,
comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. tax code and would include
instructions to 11 House committees to trigger the budget reconciliation
process to cut mandatory spending. The concurrent resolution would
assume that, over 10 years, base (non-Overseas Contingency Operations)
discretionary defense spending would be increased by a total of \$929
billion over the Budget Control Act caps and non-defense spending be
reduced by \$1.3 trillion." The vote was on passage. The House passed
the budget resolution by a vote of 219 to 206. A modified version was
later agreed to by both the House and the Senate. \[House Vote 557,

### Conference Passage

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Go To Conference With The Senate On Tax
Reform.** In December 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for a motion that stated
that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "the House disagree\[s\]
with the Senate amendment and request\[s\] a conference with the Senate
on the bill that would revise the federal income tax system by lowering
individual and corporate tax rates, repealing various deductions through
2025." The vote was on a motion to go to conference with the Senate. The
House agreed to the motion by a vote of 222 to 192. The eventual
conference report was later signed into law. \[House Vote 653,
[12/4/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll653.xml); Congressional
Quarterly, [12/4/17](http://cq.com/vote/2017/H/653?0); Congressional

### Final Passage

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Final Version Of Trump's Tax Reform
Plan, Which Substantially Cut Taxes For Rich Americans And
Corporations.** In December 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for the Tax Cut and
Jobs Act, also known as Trump's tax reform bill. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "This Conference Summary deals with the
conference report on HR 1, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the House will
consider Tuesday. The agreement significantly cuts corporate and
individual taxes and seeks to simply the tax code, although most
individual tax provisions would expire after 2025. It reduces the
corporate tax from 35% to 21% and reduces taxation of so-called
'pass-through' businesses where profits are taxed at the individual
rate. For corporate taxes it also establishes a 'territorial' tax system
that exempts most overseas income from U.S. taxation. Most individual
tax rate rates would be reduced, including by dropping the top rate from
39.6% to 37%, and it eliminates personal exemptions but nearly doubles
the standard deduction so fewer taxpayers will itemize deductions." The
vote was on a motion to concur with the Senate amendment, effectively on
passage. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill by a
vote of 224 to 201. President Trump signed the bill into law. \[House
Vote 699, [12/20/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll699.xml);

[H.R.
1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions)\]

-   **The House Had To Vote Again Because Three Provisions Violated
    Reconciliation Rules.** According to The Hill, "In a 224-201 vote,
    the House passed the bill for the second time in two days on
    Wednesday, after three provisions had to be stripped out because
    they ran afoul of Senate budget rules. The Senate approved the bill
    early Wednesday morning." \[The Hill,
    [12/20/17](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/365809-house-sends-sweeping-tax-measure-to-trump)\]

-   **The Bill's Name And Two Education Related Provisions From The
    House Passed Version Violated The Byrd Rule.** According to The
    Hill, "The Senate parliamentarian on Tuesday ruled that the GOP tax
    bill\'s short name, 'The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,' violates budget
    rules, according to the office of Senate Budget Committee ranking
    member Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The title was found to violate the
    'Byrd rule' that applies to bills moving under the 'budget
    reconciliation' process that allows legislation to avoid a
    Democratic filibuster in the Senate. Under the rule, reconciliation
    bills can't include provisions that don't have an impact on the
    budget. \[...\] The parliamentarian also ruled that two other
    provisions in the bill violate the Byrd rule. One would allows 529
    college savings plans to be expanded to be used for home-schooling
    expenses. The other offending provision was part of the criteria
    used to determine what colleges qualify for a new excise tax.
    Because of the parliamentarian\'s ruling, the House will have to
    revote on the tax bill on Wednesday. The Senate is expected to vote
    on the bill Tuesday evening with the offending provisions stricken."

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Final Version Of Trump's Tax Reform

39.6% to 37%, and it eliminates personal exemptions but nearly doubles
the standard deduction so fewer taxpayers will itemize deductions." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 227 to 203.
The Senate later passed a slightly modified version of the bill, which
the House later agreed to. President Trump later signed an amended
version of the bill into law. \[House Vote 692,
[12/19/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll692.xml); Congressional

-   **Tax Rates Would Start At 10 Percent; Top Rate Would Be Reduced To
    37 Percent.** According to Bloomberg, "Current law: Seven rates,
    starting at 10 percent and reaching 39.6 percent for incomes above
    \$418,401 for singles and \$470,701 for married, joint filers.
    Proposed: Seven rates, starting at 10 percent and reaching 37
    percent for incomes above \$500,000 for singles and \$600,000 for
    married, joint filers. For joint filers: 10 percent: \$0 to \$19,050
    12 percent: \$19,050 to \$77,400 22 percent: \$77,400 to \$165,000
    24 percent: \$165,000 to \$315,000 32 percent: \$315,000 to
    \$400,000 35 percent: \$400,000 to \$600,000 37 percent: \$600,000
    and above For single filers: 10 percent: \$0 to \$9,525 12 percent:
    \$9,525 to \$38,700 22 percent: \$38,700 to \$82,500 24 percent:
    \$82,500 to \$157,500 32 percent: \$157,500 to \$200,000 35 percent:
    \$200,000 to \$500,000 37 percent: \$500,000 and above."

-   **Bill Would Nearly Double The Standard Deduction, But Eliminate The
    Personal Exemptions.** According to Bloomberg, "Current law: \$6,350
    standard deduction for single taxpayers and \$12,700 for married
    couples, filing jointly. Personal exemptions of \$4,050 allowed for
    each family member. Proposed: \$12,000 standard deduction for single
    taxpayers and \$24,000 for married couples, filing jointly. Personal
    exemptions repealed." \[Bloomberg,
    [12/15/17](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gop-tax-overhaul-bill)\]

-   **Bill Capped The State And Local Tax Deduction At \$10,000, For
    Individuals Or Married Couple.** "You can deduct just \$10,000 in
    state, local and property taxes: One of the most controversial parts
    of the GOP tax plan is the push to greatly scale back how much state
    and local taxes Americans can deduct on their federal income taxes.
    Under current law, the state and local deduction (SALT) is
    unlimited. In the final GOP plan, people can deduct up to \$10,000
    (married couples are also limited to just \$10,000). \[...\] The
    move is widely viewed as a hit to blue states such as New York,
    Connecticut and California, and there are concerns it could cause
    property values to fall in high-tax cities and leave less money for
    public schools and road repairs." \[Washington Post,
    [12/15/17](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/15/the-final-gop-tax-bill-is-complete-heres-what-is-in-it/?utm_term=.6baabd4ead20)\]

-   **The State And Local Tax Deduction Is Effectively A Subsidy For
    Local Services.** According to the Center on Budget and Policy
    Priorities, "Second, the SALT deduction helps state and local
    governments fund public services that provide widely shared
    benefits. That's because, with this deduction, higher-income filers
    are more willing to support state and local taxes. Repealing the
    deduction would almost certainly make it harder for states and
    localities --- many of which already face serious budget strains ---
    to raise sufficient revenues in the coming years to invest in
    high-quality education, infrastructure, and other priorities crucial
    to the nation's long-term economic prospects. State borrowing costs
    could also rise as bond rating agencies react to the reduced
    capacity of states to raise adequate revenue, making needed
    infrastructure projects more expensive. States and localities could
    also respond by raising taxes or fees that fall less heavily on the
    higher-income residents most affected by the deduction's loss. That
    would push more costs to middle- and low-income people, and make
    state and local tax systems even more regressive overall than they
    already are." \[Center on Budget Policy Priorities,
    [10/24/17](https://www.cbpp.org/blog/repeal-of-state-and-local-deduction-is-a-poor-trade-for-tax-cuts-for-wealthy)\]

-   **Bill Caps The Mortgage Interest Deduction For New Loans At Up To
    \$750,000.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Limits the
    amount of mortgage interest that can be deducted to just that
    associated with the first \$750,000 of a home loan (down from \$1
    million), and eliminates through 2025 the deduction for interest on
    second homes and home equity loans (the House bill would have set
    the mortgage interest limit at \$500,000)" \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [12/18/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5236225?0)\]

-   **Legislation Increased The Child Tax Credit.** According to the
    Washington Post, "The current child tax credit is \$1,000 per child.
    The House and Senate bills expanded the child tax credit, with the
    Senate going up to a maximum of \$2,000 per child. The final bill
    keeps the \$2,000-per-child credit (families making up to about
    \$400,000 get to take the credit), but it also makes more of the tax
    credit refundable, meaning families that work but don\'t earn enough
    to actually owe any federal income taxes will get a large check back
    from the government. Benefits for those families were initially
    limited to about \$1,100, but through changes Rubio and Lee pushed
    for, it's now up to \$1,400." \[Washington Post,
    [12/15/17](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/15/the-final-gop-tax-bill-is-complete-heres-what-is-in-it/?utm_term=.6baabd4ead20)\]

-   **Legislation Increased The Exemption For The Individual AMT.**
    According to Bloomberg, "Current law: Individual AMT can apply after
    exemption level of \$54,300 for singles and \$84,500 for married,
    joint filers, and the exemptions phase out at higher incomes.
    Proposed: Increase the exemption to \$70,300 for singles and
    \$109,400 for joint filers. Increase the phase-out threshold to
    \$500,000 for singles and \$1 million for joint filers. The higher
    limits would expire on Jan. 1, 2026." \[Bloomberg,
    [12/15/17](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gop-tax-overhaul-bill)\]

-   **Bill Changed The Inflation Rate For The Tax Brackets To The
    So-Called Chained CPI, Which Grows At A Slower Rate; This Would Lead
    To Many Americans Into Joining A Higher Bracket.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Like both the House and Senate bills, the
    agreement changes the manner in which tax brackets are increased
    each year to account for inflation and thereby prevent people from
    being pushed into higher tax rates as their income grows without an
    actual increase in purchasing power. Specifically, the measure
    switches to so-called 'chained CPI,' which many economists say
    represents a more accurate estimate of inflation because it factors
    in consumer substitution of cheaper products. Chained CPI is usually
    lower than the current inflationary index used (the CPI-U; the
    Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers), which means that tax
    brackets would not rise as rapidly and more taxpayers may end up in
    higher tax rates. Under the measure, new tax brackets each year
    would be set by using chained CPI and then rounding down to the next
    lowest multiple of \$100. And unlike most other individual and
    family tax provision, the use of chained CPI would be permanent."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [12/18/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5236225?0)\]

-   **Legislation Doubles The Estate Tax Exemption.** According to the
    Washington Post, "You can pass your heirs up to \$22 million
    tax-free: In the end, the estate tax (often called the 'death tax'
    by opponents) would remain part of the U.S. tax code, but far fewer
    families will pay it. Under current law, Americans can pass on up to
    \$5.5 million tax-free (that threshold is \$11 million for married
    couples). The House wanted to do away with the estate tax entirely,
    but some senators felt that was too much of a giveaway to the
    mega-rich. The final compromise was to double the threshold, so now
    the first \$11 million that people pass on to their heirs in
    property, stocks and other assets won\'t be taxed (and yes, that
    means \$22 million for married couples)." \[Washington Post,
    [12/15/17](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/15/the-final-gop-tax-bill-is-complete-heres-what-is-in-it/?utm_term=.6baabd4ead20)\]

-   **Only 2 Out Of 1,000 Estates Will Face A Tax Under Current Law.**
    According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, "Only the
    heirs of the wealthiest 2 out of every 1,000 estates will face any
    estate tax. \[...\] Repeal would provide the top 0.2 percent of
    estates with tax-cut windfalls averaging more than \$3 million
    apiece. About 330 estates worth more than \$50 million would get tax
    cuts averaging more than \$20 million apiece." \[Center on Budget
    Policy Priorities, [Accessed

-   **2001 New York Times Article Noted That Not A Single Example Of A
    Farm Was Lost Due To The Estate Tax.** According to the Center on
    Budget and Policy Priorities, "As the New York Times reported in
    2001, when the estate tax applied to far more estates than it does
    today: 'Even one of the leading advocates for repeal of estate
    taxes, the American Farm Bureau Federation, said it could not cite a
    single example of a farm lost because of estate taxes.'" \[Center on

-   **Legislation Reduces The Threshold For The Medical Expense
    Deduction Through 2018.** According to Bloomberg, "Current law:
    Qualified medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of the taxpayer's
    adjusted gross income are deductible. Proposed: Reduce the threshold
    to 7.5 percent of AGI for 2017 and 2018." \[Bloomberg,
    [12/15/17](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gop-tax-overhaul-bill)\]

-   **Tax Policy Center: From 2018 -- 2025, Average Taxes Fall For Most
    Americans, But By 2027, 53 Percent Of Americans Would Pay More.**
    According to the Tax Policy Center, "The Tax Policy Center has
    released distributional estimates of the conference agreement for
    the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as filed on December 15, 2017. We find the
    bill would reduce taxes on average for all income groups in both
    2018 and 2025. In general, higher income households receive larger
    average tax cuts as a percentage of after-tax income, with the
    largest cuts as a share of income going to taxpayers in the 95th to
    99th percentiles of the income distribution. On average, in 2027
    taxes would change little for lower- and middle-income groups and
    decrease for higher-income groups. Compared to current law, 5
    percent of taxpayers would pay more tax in 2018, 9 percent in 2025,
    and 53 percent in 2027." \[Tax Policy Center,

-   **In 2027, 83 Percent Of The Total Tax Benefit Would Go To The Top
    One Percent.** According to Tax Policy Center, "In 2027, the overall
    average tax cut would be \$160, or 0.2 percent of after-tax income
    (table 3), largely because almost all individual income tax
    provisions would sunset after 2025. On average, taxes would be
    little changed for taxpayers in the bottom 95 percent of the income
    distribution. Taxpayers in the bottom two quintiles of the income
    distribution would face an average tax increase of 0.1 percent of
    after-tax income; taxpayers in the middle income quintile would see
    no material change on average; and taxpayers in the 95th to 99th
    income percentiles would receive an average tax cut of 0.2 percent
    of after-tax income. Taxpayers in the top 1 percent of the income
    distribution would receive an average tax cut of 0.9 percent of

-   **Last Minute Added Provision Gave A Tax Break To Real-Estate
    Moguls.** According to the International Business Times, "President
    Donald Trump has made tens of millions of dollars of a specific kind
    of income that could be subjected to a last-minute tax break
    inserted into the Republicans' tax legislation released Friday,
    according to federal records reviewed by International Business
    Times. The same is true for Tennessee GOP Sen. Bob Corker --- a
    commercial real estate mogul who suddenly switched his vote to 'yes'
    on the tax bill after the provision was added to the legislation.
    Previously, Corker was the only Republican to vote against the
    Senate version of the bill. \[...\] The reconciled tax bill includes
    a new 20 percent deduction for so-called 'pass-through' entities,
    business structures such as LLCs, LPs and S-Corporations that don't
    pay corporate taxes, but instead 'pass through' income to partners
    who pay individual tax rates on that money. The Senate version of
    the bill included safeguards that would only allow businesses to
    take advantage of the new break if they paid out significant wages
    to employees. But the new provision, which wasn't included in either
    version of the bill passed by the House and Senate, and was only
    added during the reconciliation process, gives owners of
    income-producing real estate holdings a way around that safeguard,

### House Version

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The House GOP's 2017 Tax Reform Plan Which
Significantly Cut Taxes For The Rich And Corporations.** In November
2017, Fitzpatrick voted for reconciliation legislation which
significantly altered the federal tax code. According to Congressional
Quarterly, "The bill substantially restructures the U.S. tax code to
simplify the code and reduce taxes on individuals, corporations and
small businesses. For individuals, it consolidates the current seven tax
brackets down to four and eliminates or restricts many tax credits and
deductions, including by eliminating the deduction for state and local
income taxes and limiting the deduction for property taxes to \$10,000
and the interest deduction for a home mortgage to the first \$500,000
worth of a loan. \[...\] On the business side, it reduces the corporate
tax from 35% to 20% and establishes a 'territorial' tax system that
would exempt most income derived overseas from U.S. corporate taxation.
It allows businesses to immediately expense 100% of the cost of assets
acquired and placed into service, and for small businesses it raises the
Section 179 expensing limit to \$5 million for five years. It also
establishes a 25% rate for a portion of pass-through business income
that would otherwise have to be paid at the ordinary individual tax
level, and for small businesses where an individual would receive less
than \$150,000 in pass-through income it taxes the first \$75,000 of
that income at a 9% rate." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 227 to 205. President Trump later signed an amended
version of the bill into law. \[House Vote 637,

    restructures federal income tax rates by consolidating the seven
    current rates into four rates --- 12%, 25%, 35% and 39.6% --- which
    would reduce rates for most taxpayers. Under the measure, the 12%
    bracket would apply to taxable income up to \$45,000 for individuals
    and \$90,000 for married couples; the 25% bracket to additional
    income up to \$200,000 for individuals and \$260,000 for couples;
    the 35% bracket to additional income up to \$500,000 for individuals
    and \$1 million for couples; and the top 39.6% bracket to additional

    that can be deducted to just that associated with the first
    \$500,000 of a home loan (down from \$1 million), and eliminates the
    deduction for interest on second homes and home equity loans
    (interest associated with existing mortgages as of Nov. 1, 2017,

    taxes and caps the deduction for state or local property taxes at
    \$10,000." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Legislation Eliminates The Personal Exemptions, But Doubles The
    Standard Deduction.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    bill significantly increases the standard deduction, nearly doubling
    it to \$12,200 for individual filers and \$24,400 for joint filers
    (the 2018 standard deduction is to be \$6,500 for individuals and
    \$13,000 for joint filers). However, it eliminates the personal
    exemptions that taxpayers may claim for themselves, their spouses
    and for any dependents (which for 2018 is to be \$4,150 per person).
    The personal exemption, along with either the standard deduction or
    itemized deductions, reduces a taxpayer\'s adjusted gross income in
    determining taxable income. To temporarily replace the personal
    exemption, the measure creates a new family credit (see below)."

-   **The Measure Changes The Metric In Which Inflation Is Adjusted For
    Tax Brackets To "Chained CPI", Which While More Accurate, Grows More
    Slowly Than The Current Metric.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The measure changes the manner in which tax brackets are
    increased each year to account for inflation and thereby prevent
    people from being pushed into higher tax rates as their income grows
    without an actual increase in purchasing power. Specifically, the
    bill switches to so-called 'chained CPI,' which many economists say
    represents a more accurate estimate of inflation because it factors
    in consumer substitution of cheaper products. Chained CPI is usually
    lower than the current inflationary index used (the CPI-U; the
    Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers), which means that tax
    brackets would not rise as rapidly and more taxpayers may end up in
    higher tax rates. Under the measure, new tax brackets each year
    would be set by using chained CPI and then rounding down to the next
    lowest multiple of \$100." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Legislation Repealed The Deduction For Alimony Paid.** According
    to CNBC, "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, unveiled on Thursday, includes
    a provision to kill the deduction that taxpayers get for making such
    payments to an ex-spouse. Although it\'s just one of the many tax
    breaks eliminated under the legislation, experts say it will end up
    most hurting the person receiving the money. \[...\] The new tax
    legislation essentially would shift much of the taxation from the
    recipient to the alimony payer. 'Due to the disparity in tax rates
    that exist in these cases, this would have a negative effect on the
    payee. That's the bottom line,' said Malcolm Taub, co-chair of
    Davidoff Hutcher & Citron's Divorce & Family Law Group in New York.
    Because the ex-spouse receiving the alimony typically is in a lower
    tax bracket, the amount of tax paid by the recipients --- the
    majority of which are women --- on the spousal support is less. And
    it's something that courts, attorneys and divorce planners take into
    consideration when divvying up assets." \[CNBC,

-   **Legislation Counts Tuition Waivers As Income, Thereby
    Significantly Increasing The Tax Burden For Certain Graduate
    Students.** According to CNBC, "The House Republican tax plan
    includes a \$1.5 trillion corporate tax cut and a giant tax hike on
    graduate students. Tamar Oostrom, who is currently earning her Ph.D.
    in economics at MIT, has been crunching the numbers to determine how
    the current House Republican bill would affect the taxes paid by
    graduate students. \[...\] Grad students like Oostrom often afford
    advanced degrees by earning a tuition waiver. In these instances,
    graduate students will work for the university by teaching classes
    and/or conducting research in exchange for free tuition. According
    to the American Council on Education, roughly 145,000 graduate
    students receive this kind of tuition reduction. Some programs
    provide graduate students with a modest stipend for food and
    housing. For instance, Ryan Hill, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at
    MIT, receives a \$30,000 living stipend and a tuition waiver
    allowing him to forego paying \$50,000 in tuition. He currently pays
    taxes on his \$30,000 stipend, but under the proposed House tax

-   **Legislation Modifies Numerous Education Tax Credits By Folding
    Them All Into A Reformed American Opportunity Tax Credit.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "It consolidates certain
    education tax credits, folding the Hope Scholarship Credit and the
    Lifetime Learning Credit into the American Opportunity Tax Credit
    (AOTC), which would be modified to be available for a fifth year of
    post-secondary education at half the rate as the first four years,
    with up to \$500 of the credit being refundable. The AOTC would
    continue to provide a 100% tax credit for the first \$2,000 of
    certain higher education expenses, such as tuition, fees, and course
    materials, and a 25% tax credit for the next \$2,000 of such

    income, which is generally not subject to tax at the business level
    but is taxed at the individual level when it is distributed to
    owners in the form of profits, wages, or capital gains. It
    establishes a new top 25% rate on such pass-through business income,
    but generally allows just 30% of a business\'s net income to be
    taxed at that rate, with the remainder being taxed at the
    individual\'s ordinary income rate. Services firms such as lawyers,
    accountants and physicians generally could not take advantage of

    federal government does not subsidize the borrowing costs of private
    businesses to the detriment of other business that cannot avail
    themselves of PABs." \[Congressional Quarterly,

    in the future by state and local governments to finance the

    According to USA Today, "A provision in the tax bill to allow
    churches to be more directly engaged in politics could cost the U.S.
    government hundreds of millions of dollars, congressional experts
    say, because some political donors would shift their money to
    tax-exempt charities. The House Ways and Means Committee approved a
    sweeping overhaul of the tax code Thursday, including a provision to

    million new jobs, increase annual after-tax income for middle-income
    households by an average of \$4,000 and grow the U.S. economy by
    more than 3.5% each year. Workers will finally be able to get the
    raise they deserve, more families will have help to buy a home,

    statement from Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a
    Responsible Federal Budget: The House approved debt-financed tax
    cuts based on predictions of magical economic growth that defy
    history and all credible analyses. Tax reform should grow the
    economy and not add to the debt. Unfortunately, lawmakers are
    assuming faster economic growth will pay for that debt increase when

    clear: Big businesses get a large, permanent tax cut, while American
    families receive only temporary tax relief that expires as soon as
    2023 in the House bill and 2026 in the Senate bill. In the House
    bill, the tax increase would mostly hit moderate and middle-income
    families because a credit designed to help them expires after five
    years. But in the Senate plan, released late Tuesday, virtually all
    Americans would face higher tax rates because the individual income
    rate cuts go away entirely in 2026. The tax cuts for corporations do
    not expire." \[Washington Post,
