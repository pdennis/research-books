# Higher Education Tax Credits

### American Opportunity Tax Credit

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The House GOP's 2017 Tax Reform Plan Which
Significantly Cut Taxes For The Rich And Corporations And Consolidated
Various Education Tax Credits.** In November 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for
reconciliation legislation which significantly altered the federal tax
code. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill substantially
restructures the U.S. tax code to simplify the code and reduce taxes on
individuals, corporations and small businesses. For individuals, it
consolidates the current seven tax brackets down to four and eliminates
or restricts many tax credits and deductions, including by eliminating
the deduction for state and local income taxes and limiting the
deduction for property taxes to \$10,000 and the interest deduction for
a home mortgage to the first \$500,000 worth of a loan. \[...\] On the
business side, it reduces the corporate tax from 35% to 20% and
establishes a 'territorial' tax system that would exempt most income
derived overseas from U.S. corporate taxation. It allows businesses to
immediately expense 100% of the cost of assets acquired and placed into
service, and for small businesses it raises the Section 179 expensing
limit to \$5 million for five years. It also establishes a 25% rate for
a portion of pass-through business income that would otherwise have to
be paid at the ordinary individual tax level, and for small businesses
where an individual would receive less than \$150,000 in pass-through
income it taxes the first \$75,000 of that income at a 9% rate." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 227 to 205.
President Trump later signed an amended version of the bill into law.

-   **Legislation Modified Numerous Education Tax Credits By Folding
    Them All Into A Reformed American Opportunity Tax Credit.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "It consolidates certain
    education tax credits, folding the Hope Scholarship Credit and the
    Lifetime Learning Credit into the American Opportunity Tax Credit
    (AOTC), which would be modified to be available for a fifth year of
    post-secondary education at half the rate as the first four years,
    with up to \$500 of the credit being refundable. The AOTC would
    continue to provide a 100% tax credit for the first \$2,000 of
    certain higher education expenses, such as tuition, fees, and course
    materials, and a 25% tax credit for the next \$2,000 of such
    expenses." \[Congressional Quarterly,
