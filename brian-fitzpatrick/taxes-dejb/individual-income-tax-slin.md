# Individual Income Tax

### Alimony Tax Deduction

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The House GOP's 2017 Tax Reform Plan Which
Significantly Cut Taxes For The Rich And Corporations And Repealed The
Tax Deduction For Alimony.** In November 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for
reconciliation legislation which significantly altered the federal tax
code. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill substantially
restructures the U.S. tax code to simplify the code and reduce taxes on
individuals, corporations and small businesses. For individuals, it
consolidates the current seven tax brackets down to four and eliminates
or restricts many tax credits and deductions, including by eliminating
the deduction for state and local income taxes and limiting the
deduction for property taxes to \$10,000 and the interest deduction for
a home mortgage to the first \$500,000 worth of a loan. \[...\] On the
business side, it reduces the corporate tax from 35% to 20% and
establishes a 'territorial' tax system that would exempt most income
derived overseas from U.S. corporate taxation. It allows businesses to
immediately expense 100% of the cost of assets acquired and placed into
service, and for small businesses it raises the Section 179 expensing
limit to \$5 million for five years. It also establishes a 25% rate for
a portion of pass-through business income that would otherwise have to
be paid at the ordinary individual tax level, and for small businesses
where an individual would receive less than \$150,000 in pass-through
income it taxes the first \$75,000 of that income at a 9% rate." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 227 to 205.
President Trump later signed an amended version of the bill into law.

-   **Legislation Repealed The Deduction For Alimony Paid.** According
    to CNBC, "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, unveiled on Thursday, includes
    a provision to kill the deduction that taxpayers get for making such
    payments to an ex-spouse. Although it\'s just one of the many tax
    breaks eliminated under the legislation, experts say it will end up
    most hurting the person receiving the money. \[...\] The new tax
    legislation essentially would shift much of the taxation from the
    recipient to the alimony payer. 'Due to the disparity in tax rates
    that exist in these cases, this would have a negative effect on the
    payee. That's the bottom line,' said Malcolm Taub, co-chair of
    Davidoff Hutcher & Citron's Divorce & Family Law Group in New York.
    Because the ex-spouse receiving the alimony typically is in a lower
    tax bracket, the amount of tax paid by the recipients --- the
    majority of which are women --- on the spousal support is less. And
    it's something that courts, attorneys and divorce planners take into
    consideration when divvying up assets." \[CNBC,

### Carried Interest

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The House GOP's 2017 Tax Reform Plan Which
Significantly Cut Taxes For The Rich And Corporations And Modified The
Carried Interest Deduction.** In November 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for
reconciliation legislation which significantly altered the federal tax
code. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill substantially
restructures the U.S. tax code to simplify the code and reduce taxes on
individuals, corporations and small businesses. For individuals, it
consolidates the current seven tax brackets down to four and eliminates
or restricts many tax credits and deductions, including by eliminating

-   **Legislation Modified, But Does Not Eliminate, The Carried Interest
    Loophole By Required Assets Be Held For Three Years Instead Of Just
    One.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Carried Interest ---
    The bill modifies the so-called 'carried interest rule,' which
    allows private equity and hedge fund managers to be taxed on certain
    income at the lower capital gains rate rather than at the individual
    tax rate for ordinary income. Specifically, it requires that for
    preferential capital gains treatment the asset must be held for at
    least three years, instead of only one." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [11/15/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5217156?4)\]

-   **During The 2016 Presidential Campaign, Trump Was In Favor Of
    Closing This Loophole.** According to the New York Times, "During
    the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump called for closing the
    loophole. He called hedge fund managers 'paper pushers' who were
    'getting away with murder' partly because of measures including the
    carried-interest provision that he said allowed them to shield their
    wealth and to minimize their tax burdens." \[New York Times,
    [11/3/17](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/business/trump-carried-interest-tax-loophole.html)\]

### Chained CPI

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Final Version Of Trump's Tax Reform
Plan, Which Substantially Cut Taxes For Rich Americans And Corporations,
And Changed The Rate Of Inflation For The Individual Tax Rate To The
Chained-CPI.** In December 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for the Tax Cut and
Jobs Act, also known as Trump's tax reform bill. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "This Conference Summary deals with the
conference report on HR 1, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the House will
consider Tuesday. The agreement significantly cuts corporate and
individual taxes and seeks to simply the tax code, although most
individual tax provisions would expire after 2025. It reduces the
corporate tax from 35% to 21% and reduces taxation of so-called
'pass-through' businesses where profits are taxed at the individual
rate. For corporate taxes it also establishes a 'territorial' tax system
that exempts most overseas income from U.S. taxation. Most individual
tax rate rates would be reduced, including by dropping the top rate from
39.6% to 37%, and it eliminates personal exemptions but nearly doubles
the standard deduction so fewer taxpayers will itemize deductions." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 227 to 203.
The Senate later passed a slightly modified version of the bill, which
the House later agreed to. President Trump later signed an amended
version of the bill into law. \[House Vote 692,
[12/19/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll692.xml); Congressional
Quarterly, [12/18/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5236225?0);
Congressional Actions, [H.R.
1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions)\]

-   **Bill Changed The Inflation Rate For The Tax Brackets To The
    So-Called Chained CPI, Which Grows At A Slower Rate; This Would Lead
    To Many Americans Into Joining A Higher Bracket.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Like both the House and Senate bills, the
    agreement changes the manner in which tax brackets are increased
    each year to account for inflation and thereby prevent people from
    being pushed into higher tax rates as their income grows without an
    actual increase in purchasing power. Specifically, the measure
    switches to so-called 'chained CPI,' which many economists say
    represents a more accurate estimate of inflation because it factors
    in consumer substitution of cheaper products. Chained CPI is usually
    lower than the current inflationary index used (the CPI-U; the
    Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers), which means that tax
    brackets would not rise as rapidly and more taxpayers may end up in
    higher tax rates. Under the measure, new tax brackets each year
    would be set by using chained CPI and then rounding down to the next
    lowest multiple of \$100. And unlike most other individual and
    family tax provision, the use of chained CPI would be permanent."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [12/18/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5236225?0)\]

-   **In 2027, 83 Percent Of The Total Tax Benefit Would Go To The Top
    One Percent.** According to Tax Policy Center, "In 2027, the overall
    average tax cut would be \$160, or 0.2 percent of after-tax income
    (table 3), largely because almost all individual income tax
    provisions would sunset after 2025. On average, taxes would be
    little changed for taxpayers in the bottom 95 percent of the income
    distribution. Taxpayers in the bottom two quintiles of the income
    distribution would face an average tax increase of 0.1 percent of
    after-tax income; taxpayers in the middle income quintile would see
    no material change on average; and taxpayers in the 95th to 99th
    income percentiles would receive an average tax cut of 0.2 percent
    of after-tax income. Taxpayers in the top 1 percent of the income
    distribution would receive an average tax cut of 0.9 percent of
    after-tax income, accounting for 83 percent of the total benefit for
    that year." \[Tax Policy Center,
    [12/18/17](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/publication/150816/2001641_distributional_analysis_of_the_conference_agreement_for_the_tax_cuts_and_jobs_act.pdf)\]

-   **In 2027, 86 Million Americans Would See A Tax Increase.**
    According to ABC News, "The bill, which carries an estimated \$1.5
    trillion price tag over 10 years, is not expected to win any
    Democratic support. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi points to a
    new analysis from the non-partisan Tax Policy Center that predicts
    86 million people would see a tax increase compared to current law
    by 2027, while 83 percent of the anticipated benefits would be
    reaped by the wealthiest one percent of taxpayers." \[ABC News,
    [12/19/17](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-expected-pass-tax-reform-measure/story?id=51870650)\]

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The House GOP's 2017 Tax Reform Plan Which

Code Inflation Measurement To The Chained CPI.** In November 2017,
Fitzpatrick voted for reconciliation legislation which significantly
altered the federal tax code. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The

25% rate for a portion of pass-through business income that would
otherwise have to be paid at the ordinary individual tax level, and for
small businesses where an individual would receive less than \$150,000
in pass-through income it taxes the first \$75,000 of that income at a
9% rate." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote
of 227 to 205. President Trump later signed an amended version of the

-   **The Measure Changes The Metric In Which Inflation Is Adjusted For
    Tax Brackets To The "Chained CPI", Which While More Accurate, Grows
    More Slowly Than The Current Metric.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The measure changes the manner in which tax brackets are
    increased each year to account for inflation and thereby prevent
    people from being pushed into higher tax rates as their income grows
    without an actual increase in purchasing power. Specifically, the

### Increase For Wealthy Individuals

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Establishing An Additional 5% Tax On
Individuals Earning Over \$10 Million And An Extra 3% Tax On Incomes
Over \$25 Million.** In November 2021, Fitzpatrick voted against the
Build Back Better act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"establish or modify various taxes on corporations and high-income
individuals, including to establish a 15 percent alternative minimum tax
for corporations with an annual income exceeding \$1 billion; a one
percent tax on stock buybacks by public companies; and an additional
five percent tax on individual income over \$10 million and further
three percent tax on income over \$25 million." The vote was on passage.
The House passed the bill by a vote of 220-213. \[House Vote 385,

### Moving Tax Deduction

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The House GOP's 2017 Tax Reform Plan Which
Significantly Cut Taxes For The Rich And Corporations And Repealed The
Tax Deduction For Most American's Moving Expenses.** In November 2017,
Fitzpatrick voted for reconciliation legislation which significantly

-   **Legislation Alters The Moving Expense Tax Break To Only Allow It

    "For moving expenses, it allows a deduction only for members of the
    active-duty military." \[Congressional Quarterly,

### Tax Cuts

-   **Tax Rates Would Start At 10 Percent; Top Rate Would Be Reduced To
    37 Percent.** According to Bloomberg, "Current law: Seven rates,
    starting at 10 percent and reaching 39.6 percent for incomes above
    \$418,401 for singles and \$470,701 for married, joint filers.
    Proposed: Seven rates, starting at 10 percent and reaching 37
    percent for incomes above \$500,000 for singles and \$600,000 for
    married, joint filers. For joint filers: 10 percent: \$0 to \$19,050
    12 percent: \$19,050 to \$77,400 22 percent: \$77,400 to \$165,000
    24 percent: \$165,000 to \$315,000 32 percent: \$315,000 to

-   **Bill Would Nearly Double The Standard Deduction, But Eliminate The
    Personal Exemptions.** According to Bloomberg, "Current law: \$6,350
    standard deduction for single taxpayers and \$12,700 for married
    couples, filing jointly. Personal exemptions of \$4,050 allowed for
    each family member. Proposed: \$12,000 standard deduction for single
    taxpayers and \$24,000 for married couples, filing jointly. Personal
    exemptions repealed." \[Bloomberg,

-   **Legislation Increased The Child Tax Credit.** According to the
    Washington Post, "The current child tax credit is \$1,000 per child.
    The House and Senate bills expanded the child tax credit, with the
    Senate going up to a maximum of \$2,000 per child. The final bill
    keeps the \$2,000-per-child credit (families making up to about
    \$400,000 get to take the credit), but it also makes more of the tax
    credit refundable, meaning families that work but don\'t earn enough
    to actually owe any federal income taxes will get a large check back
    from the government. Benefits for those families were initially
    limited to about \$1,100, but through changes Rubio and Lee pushed
    for, it's now up to \$1,400." \[Washington Post,

-   **Legislation Increased The Exemption For The Individual AMT.**
    According to Bloomberg, "Current law: Individual AMT can apply after
    exemption level of \$54,300 for singles and \$84,500 for married,
    joint filers, and the exemptions phase out at higher incomes.
    Proposed: Increase the exemption to \$70,300 for singles and
    \$109,400 for joint filers. Increase the phase-out threshold to
    \$500,000 for singles and \$1 million for joint filers. The higher
    limits would expire on Jan. 1, 2026." \[Bloomberg,

-   **Tax Policy Center: From 2018 -- 2025, Average Taxes Fall For Most
    Americans, But By 2027, 53 Percent Of Americans Would Pay More.**
    According to the Tax Policy Center, "The Tax Policy Center has
    released distributional estimates of the conference agreement for
    the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as filed on December 15, 2017. We find the
    bill would reduce taxes on average for all income groups in both
    2018 and 2025. In general, higher income households receive larger
    average tax cuts as a percentage of after-tax income, with the
    largest cuts as a share of income going to taxpayers in the 95th to
    99th percentiles of the income distribution. On average, in 2027
    taxes would change little for lower- and middle-income groups and
    decrease for higher-income groups. Compared to current law, 5
    percent of taxpayers would pay more tax in 2018, 9 percent in 2025,
    and 53 percent in 2027." \[Tax Policy Center,

-   **Most Of The Bill's Tax Cuts For Individuals Are Temporary, But The
    Corporate Ones Are Permanent.** According to the Washington Post,
    "The core of the plan is a massive and permanent cut to the
    corporate tax rate, dropping it from 35 percent to 21 percent. The
    bill also would cut individual tax rates for all income tax levels.
    Families earning less than \$25,000 a year would receive an average
    tax cut of \$60, while those earning more than \$733,000 would see
    an average cut of \$51,000, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy
    Center. Many of the breaks for individuals are set to expire in the

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The House GOP's 2017 Tax Reform Plan Which
Significantly Cut Taxes For The Rich And Corporations; Legislation Moved
The Tax Rates From Seven To Four.** In November 2017, Fitzpatrick voted
for reconciliation legislation which significantly altered the federal
tax code. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill substantially
restructures the U.S. tax code to simplify the code and reduce taxes on
individuals, corporations and small businesses. For individuals, it
consolidates the current seven tax brackets down to four and eliminates
or restricts many tax credits and deductions, including by eliminating
the deduction for state and local income taxes and limiting the
deduction for property taxes to \$10,000 and the interest deduction for
a home mortgage to the first \$500,000 worth of a loan. \[...\] On the
business side, it reduces the corporate tax from 35% to 20% and
establishes a 'territorial' tax system that would exempt most income
derived overseas from U.S. corporate taxation. It allows businesses to
immediately expense 100% of the cost of assets acquired and placed into
service, and for small businesses it raises the Section 179 expensing
limit to \$5 million for five years. It also establishes a 25% rate for
a portion of pass-through business income that would otherwise have to
be paid at the ordinary individual tax level, and for small businesses
where an individual would receive less than \$150,000 in pass-through
income it taxes the first \$75,000 of that income at a 9% rate." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 227 to 205.
President Trump later signed an amended version of the bill into law.

-   **Legislation Alters The Federal Individual Income Tax Structure
    From Seven To Four Tax Rates, Including Increasing The Top Rate From
    \$500,000 To \$1,000,000 For An Individual.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Tax Rate Restructuring --- Reduces and
    restructures federal income tax rates by consolidating the seven
    current rates into four rates --- 12%, 25%, 35% and 39.6% --- which
    would reduce rates for most taxpayers. Under the measure, the 12%
    bracket would apply to taxable income up to \$45,000 for individuals
    and \$90,000 for married couples; the 25% bracket to additional
    income up to \$200,000 for individuals and \$260,000 for couples;
    the 35% bracket to additional income up to \$500,000 for individuals
    and \$1 million for couples; and the top 39.6% bracket to additional
    income above those levels." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [11/15/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5217156?4)\]

-   **Bill Raised The Bottom Rate From The Current 10 Percent To 12
    Percent.** According to the New York Times, "It would keep the
    bottom tax bracket for individuals at 10 percent, which the House
    had raised to 12 percent, and would reduce the top rate for high
    earners to 38.5 percent, down from the current rate of 39.6 percent,
    which the House had maintained. Like the House bill, the Senate's
    version plans to roughly double the standard deduction and expand
    the child tax credit." \[New York Times,

-   **Bill Includes Permanent Tax Cuts For Corporations, But Not For
    Individuals.** According to the Washington Post, The essential
    gamble of Republican plans to overhaul the tax code is now becoming
    clear: Big businesses get a large, permanent tax cut, while American
    families receive only temporary tax relief that expires as soon as
    2023 in the House bill and 2026 in the Senate bill. In the House
    bill, the tax increase would mostly hit moderate and middle-income
    families because a credit designed to help them expires after five
    years. But in the Senate plan, released late Tuesday, virtually all
    Americans would face higher tax rates because the individual income
    rate cuts go away entirely in 2026. The tax cuts for corporations do
    not expire." \[Washington Post,

-   **Legislation Would Raise Taxes On 36 Million Middle Class
    Americans.** By 2027 According to the Tax Policy Center via the
    Center for American Progress, "In fact, the Tax Policy Center found
    that 36 million middle-class and working families nationally would
    experience a tax increase under the House tax plan by 2027."

-   **By 2027, The Top 1 Percent Would Get 50 Percent Of The Total
    Benefit.** According to the Tax Policy Center, "In 2027, the overall
    average tax cut would be smaller than in 2018, reducing taxes by
    about \$860 on average, or 0.9 percent of after-tax income (table
    2). Taxpayers in the bottom two quintiles of the income distribution
    (those with income less than about \$55,000) would see little change
    in their taxes, with average tax decreases of \$50 or less.
    Taxpayers in the middle of the income distribution would see a net
    tax cut on average and see their after-tax incomes increase 0.5
    percent. Taxpayers in the top 1 percent would receive nearly 50
    percent of the total benefit; their after-tax income would increase
    2.6 percent on average." \[Tax Policy Center,

-   **Legislation Eliminates The Personal Exemptions, But Doubles The
    Standard Deduction.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    bill significantly increases the standard deduction, nearly doubling
    it to \$12,200 for individual filers and \$24,400 for joint filers
    (the 2018 standard deduction is to be \$6,500 for individuals and
    \$13,000 for joint filers). However, it eliminates the personal
    exemptions that taxpayers may claim for themselves, their spouses
    and for any dependents (which for 2018 is to be \$4,150 per person).
    The personal exemption, along with either the standard deduction or
    itemized deductions, reduces a taxpayer\'s adjusted gross income in
    determining taxable income. To temporarily replace the personal
    exemption, the measure creates a new family credit (see below)."

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee

On Capital Gains, Dividends, And Interest Income.** In October 2017,
Fitzpatrick voted against a budget resolution that would in part,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new
budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal
2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap
total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and
would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for
fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to
war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of
the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the
Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program.
It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the
U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the
budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget
resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281.

    Budget, "Likewise, tax reform should reduce other impediments to
    savings and investment, which are the lifeblood of the economy. The
    current system double taxes savings and investment because these
    investments are initially made using after-tax income. The gains
    from the investment are then subject to another round of taxation.

significantly repealed portions of the Affordable Care Act by cutting
Medicaid, cutting taxes on the rich, removing safeguard for pre-existing

would have in part, also according to Congressional Quarterly, "ma\[d\]e

### Top Tax Rates

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Congressional Progressive
Caucus's Budget Resolution, Which Among Other Things, Increased Taxes On
The Rich And Corporations And Called For Creating A Public Option In The
ACA's Marketplace.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against an FY
2018 CPC budget resolution. According to Congressional Quarterly, the
resolution would "provide for \$3.8 trillion in new budget authority in
fiscal 2018, not including off-budget accounts. It would raise overall
spending by \$3.5 trillion over 10 years and would increase revenues by
\$8.2 trillion over the same period through policies that would increase
taxes for corporations and high-income individuals. It would repeal the
Budget Control Act sequester and caps on discretionary spending, would
modify the tax code by adding five higher marginal tax rates, would
create a public insurance option to be sold within the current health
insurance exchanges and would call for implementation of comprehensive
immigration overhaul." The amendment was a substitute amendment for the
GOP's FY 2018 budget resolution in part designed to start the process
for tax reform. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 108 to
