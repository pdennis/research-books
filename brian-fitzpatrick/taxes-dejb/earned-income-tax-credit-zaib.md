# Earned Income Tax Credit

### Expansion

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Congressional Progressive
Caucus's Budget Resolution, Which Among Other Things, Increased Taxes On
The Rich And Corporations And Called Expanding The Child Tax Credit And
The EITC.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against an FY 2018 CPC
budget resolution. According to Congressional Quarterly, the resolution
would "provide for \$3.8 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal
2018, not including off-budget accounts. It would raise overall spending
by \$3.5 trillion over 10 years and would increase revenues by \$8.2
trillion over the same period through policies that would increase taxes
for corporations and high-income individuals. It would repeal the Budget
Control Act sequester and caps on discretionary spending, would modify
the tax code by adding five higher marginal tax rates, would create a
public insurance option to be sold within the current health insurance
exchanges and would call for implementation of comprehensive immigration
overhaul." In addition, according to the Congressional Progressive
Caucus, "Expands the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Care
Credit." The amendment was a substitute amendment for the GOP's FY 2018
budget resolution in part designed to start the process for tax reform.
The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 108 to 314. \[House Vote

### Extension

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The American Rescue Plan Act Of 2021,
Which Expanded The Maximum Earned Income Tax Credit For Adults Without
Kids.** In March 2021, Fitzpatrick voted against concurring in the
Senate amendment to the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 which would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "expand eligibility and increase
the maximum earned income tax credit for childless adults and increase
the child tax credit to \$3,000 per child." The vote was on concurring
in the Senate amendment to the bill. The House concurred with the Senate
by a vote of 220-211 and sent to the President and ultimately the bill
became law. \[House Vote 72,
