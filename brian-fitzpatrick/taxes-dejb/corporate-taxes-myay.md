# Corporate Taxes

### Alternative Minimum Tax

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Establishing A 15% Alternative Minimum
Tax For Corporations With A Minimum Income Of \$1 Billion Over A 3-Year
Period.** In August 2022, according to the Congressional Research
Service, Fitzpatrick voted against concurring in the Senate amendment to
the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which "imposes an alternative
minimum tax of 15% of the average annual adjusted financial statement
income of domestic corporations (excluding Subchapter S corporations,
regulated investment companies, and real estate investment trusts) that
exceeds \$1 billion over a specified 3-year period. The tax is effective
in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022." The vote was on a
motion to concur. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote 220-207,
thus the bill was sent to President Biden for final signage. President
Biden signed the bill and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 420,

-   **To Offset Costs Of The Spending Included In The Inflation
    Reduction Act, The Bill Established A New Corporate Tax On Certain
    Large Corporations That Currently Do Not Pay Federal Taxes.**
    According to The Washington Post, "To pay for the spending,
    Democrats included a new tax on a set of large companies that
    currently pay nothing to the U.S. government, and added about \$80
    billion for the IRS to pursue those who dodge what they owe." \[The
    Washington Post,
    [8/7/22](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/08/07/senate-inflation-reduction-act-climate/)\]

-   **To Retain Senator Kyrsten Sinema's (D) Support, The Amended Bill
    Exempted Private Equity And The Companies In Their Portfolios From
    The Alternative Minimum Tax.** According to The Washington Post, "On
    Sunday, the senator intervened again, this time in a way that
    benefited private equity and the companies in their portfolios. That
    forced Democrats to rethink their minimum tax --- and essentially
    carve out the industry --- to retain her support." \[The Washington
    Post,
    [8/7/22](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/08/07/senate-inflation-reduction-act-climate/)\]

-   **To Retain Senator Kyrsten Sinema's (D) Support, Democrats Had To
    Remove A Provision That Would Have "Narrowed The Carried Interest
    Tax Loophole" And Generated \$14 Billion In Additional Revenue.**
    According to NPR, "A portion that got cut, though, is one that
    narrowed the carried interest tax loophole. Arizona Kyrsten Sinema
    agreed to sign onto the bill if this measure, which would have
    changed the way private equity income is taxed, was cut. Democrats
    said it would have brought in \$14 billion in revenue." \[NPR,

-   **The Minimum Tax Was Proposed To Prevent Large Corporations Earning
    At Least \$1 Billion From Paying Low Taxes But The Bill Offered
    Several Exemptions.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    minimum tax is aimed at preventing the largest corporations, those
    earning at least \$1 billion, from paying very low effective tax
    rates." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [8/7/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7546698?2)\]

-   **The Bill Excluded Subchapter S Corporations, Regulated Investment
    Companies And Real Estate Investment Trusts From The Alternative
    Minimum Tax.** According to the Congressional Research Service,
    "This bill imposes an alternative minimum tax of 15% of the average
    annual adjusted financial statement income of domestic corporations
    (excluding Subchapter S corporations, regulated investment
    companies, and real estate investment trusts) that exceeds \$1
    billion over a specified 3-year period. The tax is effective in
    taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022." \[Congressional
    Research Service,
    [8/7/22](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376)\]

-   **The Bill Provided Tax Exemptions, Including For Purchases Of
    Equipment, "Amortization Of Wireless Spectrum Assets," Contributions
    To Pension Plans, And Net Operating Losses.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The minimum tax is aimed at preventing the
    largest corporations, those earning at least \$1 billion, from
    paying very low effective tax rates. But the final version still
    offers a range of exemptions for purchases of machinery and other
    equipment; amortization of wireless spectrum assets; pension plan
    contributions; net operating losses;" \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [8/7/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7546698?2)\]

### Business Expensing

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Final Version Of Trump's Tax Reform
Plan, Which Substantially Cut Taxes For Rich Americans And Corporations,
And Allowed Immediate Business Expensing.** In December 2017,
Fitzpatrick voted for the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, also known as Trump's
tax reform bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "This Conference
Summary deals with the conference report on HR 1, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,
which the House will consider Tuesday. The agreement significantly cuts
corporate and individual taxes and seeks to simply the tax code,
although most individual tax provisions would expire after 2025. It
reduces the corporate tax from 35% to 21% and reduces taxation of
so-called 'pass-through' businesses where profits are taxed at the
individual rate. For corporate taxes it also establishes a 'territorial'
tax system that exempts most overseas income from U.S. taxation. Most
individual tax rate rates would be reduced, including by dropping the
top rate from 39.6% to 37%, and it eliminates personal exemptions but
nearly doubles the standard deduction so fewer taxpayers will itemize
deductions." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 227 to 203. The Senate later passed a slightly modified version
of the bill, which the House later agreed to. President Trump later
signed an amended version of the bill into law. \[House Vote 692,

-   **Bill Allowed For Immediate Business Expensing From 2017 Though
    2022.** According to Bloomberg, "Current law: Businesses must take
    depreciation, spreading the recognition of their equipment costs for
    tax purposes over several years. Proposed: Businesses could fully
    and immediately deduct the cost of certain equipment purchased after
    Sept. 27, 2017 and before Jan. 1, 2023. After that, the percentage
    of cost that could be immediately deducted would gradually phase
    down." \[Bloomberg,
    [12/15/17](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gop-tax-overhaul-bill)\]

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The House GOP's 2017 Tax Reform Plan Which
Significantly Cut Taxes For The Rich And Corporations And Altered
Business Expensing To Allow Full Immediate Expensing.** In November
2017, Fitzpatrick voted for reconciliation legislation which
significantly altered the federal tax code. According to Congressional
Quarterly, "The bill substantially restructures the U.S. tax code to
simplify the code and reduce taxes on individuals, corporations and
small businesses. For individuals, it consolidates the current seven tax
brackets down to four and eliminates or restricts many tax credits and
deductions, including by eliminating the deduction for state and local
income taxes and limiting the deduction for property taxes to \$10,000
and the interest deduction for a home mortgage to the first \$500,000
worth of a loan. \[...\] On the business side, it reduces the corporate
tax from 35% to 20% and establishes a 'territorial' tax system that
would exempt most income derived overseas from U.S. corporate taxation.
It allows businesses to immediately expense 100% of the cost of assets
acquired and placed into service, and for small businesses it raises the
Section 179 expensing limit to \$5 million for five years. It also
establishes a 25% rate for a portion of pass-through business income
that would otherwise have to be paid at the ordinary individual tax
level, and for small businesses where an individual would receive less
than \$150,000 in pass-through income it taxes the first \$75,000 of
that income at a 9% rate." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 227 to 205. President Trump later signed an amended
version of the bill into law. \[House Vote 637,

-   **Legislation Would Allow For Immediate Business Expensing For Five
    Years.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "It allows businesses
    (excluding public utilities and real estate-related businesses) for
    five years to immediately expense 100% of the cost of assets that
    are acquired and placed into service by the business, and also
    repeals the ability of a business to use stockpiled alternative
    minimum tax (AMT) credits in the place of depreciation."

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The House GOP's 2017 Tax Reform Plan Which

-   **Legislation Repealed The Corporate AMT.** According to

    alternative minimum tax (AMT), as well as the ability of a business
    to use stockpiled AMT credits in the place of depreciation."

Congressional Actions, [H.R.
1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions)\]

-   **Bill Repealed The Corporate AMT.** According to Bloomberg,
    "Current law: Applies a 20 percent rate as part of a parallel tax
    system that limits tax benefits to prevent large-scale tax
    avoidance. Companies must calculate their ordinary tax and AMT tax,
    and pay whichever is higher. Proposed: Repealed" \[Bloomberg,
    [12/15/17](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gop-tax-overhaul-bill)\]

-   **Bill Lowers The Corporate Tax Rate From 35 Percent To 21
    Percent.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "It cuts the
    corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, allows businesses (excluding
    public utilities and real estate-related businesses) to immediately
    expense 100% of the cost of assets that are acquired and placed into
    service by the business (up from 50% under current law), and repeals
    the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for corporations." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [12/18/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5236225?0)\]

-   **In 2027, 83 Percent Of The Total Tax Benefit Would Go To The Top
    One Percent.** According to Tax Policy Center, "In 2027, the overall
    average tax cut would be \$160, or 0.2 percent of after-tax income
    (table 3), largely because almost all individual income tax
    provisions would sunset after 2025. On average, taxes would be
    little changed for taxpayers in the bottom 95 percent of the income
    distribution. Taxpayers in the bottom two quintiles of the income
    distribution would face an average tax increase of 0.1 percent of
    after-tax income; taxpayers in the middle income quintile would see
    no material change on average; and taxpayers in the 95th to 99th
    income percentiles would receive an average tax cut of 0.2 percent
    of after-tax income. Taxpayers in the top 1 percent of the income
    distribution would receive an average tax cut of 0.9 percent of
    after-tax income, accounting for 83 percent of the total benefit for
    that year." \[Tax Policy Center,

-   **In 2027, 86 Million Americans Would See A Tax Increase.**
    According to ABC News, "The bill, which carries an estimated \$1.5
    trillion price tag over 10 years, is not expected to win any
    Democratic support. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi points to a
    new analysis from the non-partisan Tax Policy Center that predicts
    86 million people would see a tax increase compared to current law
    by 2027, while 83 percent of the anticipated benefits would be
    reaped by the wealthiest one percent of taxpayers." \[ABC News,
    [12/19/17](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-expected-pass-tax-reform-measure/story?id=51870650)\]

-   **Most Of The Bill's Tax Cuts For Individuals Are Temporary, But The
    Corporate Ones Are Permanent.** According to the Washington Post,
    "The core of the plan is a massive and permanent cut to the
    corporate tax rate, dropping it from 35 percent to 21 percent. The
    bill also would cut individual tax rates for all income tax levels.
    Families earning less than \$25,000 a year would receive an average
    tax cut of \$60, while those earning more than \$733,000 would see
    an average cut of \$51,000, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy
    Center. Many of the breaks for individuals are set to expire in the
    coming years. Republicans set those expiration dates to comply with
    Senate limits on how much their legislation could add to the
    nation's deficit, and they say a future Congress will extend the
    cuts or make them permanent." \[Washington Post,

-   **American Companies Used Earnings From Tax Cuts To Bolster Their
    Share Prices.** According to the New York Times, "American companies
    spent more than \$800 billion on their own shares last year, taking
    a windfall from deep corporate tax cuts to try to bolster their
    share prices and improve the look of their quarterly earnings
    reports." \[New York Times,

-   **Bill Includes Permanent Tax Cuts For Corporations, But Not For
    Individuals.** According to the Washington Post, The essential
    gamble of Republican plans to overhaul the tax code is now becoming
    clear: Big businesses get a large, permanent tax cut, while American
    families receive only temporary tax relief that expires as soon as
    2023 in the House bill and 2026 in the Senate bill. In the House
    bill, the tax increase would mostly hit moderate and middle-income
    families because a credit designed to help them expires after five
    years. But in the Senate plan, released late Tuesday, virtually all
    Americans would face higher tax rates because the individual income
    rate cuts go away entirely in 2026. The tax cuts for corporations do
    not expire." \[Washington Post,

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Lowering The Corporate Tax
Rate To 20 Percent At The Most.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted
against a budget resolution that would in part, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget
authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by
reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total
discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would
assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal
2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or
terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010
health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's
Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would
require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S.
Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the
budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget
resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281.

    corporate side, the tax rate should be reduced to no more than 20
    percent." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Congressional Progressive
Caucus's Budget Resolution, Which Among Other Things, Increased Taxes On
The Rich And Corporations And Called For Creating A Public Option In The
ACA's Marketplace.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against an FY
2018 CPC budget resolution. According to Congressional Quarterly, the
resolution would "provide for \$3.8 trillion in new budget authority in
fiscal 2018, not including off-budget accounts. It would raise overall
spending by \$3.5 trillion over 10 years and would increase revenues by
\$8.2 trillion over the same period through policies that would increase
taxes for corporations and high-income individuals. It would repeal the
Budget Control Act sequester and caps on discretionary spending, would
modify the tax code by adding five higher marginal tax rates, would
create a public insurance option to be sold within the current health
insurance exchanges and would call for implementation of comprehensive
immigration overhaul." The amendment was a substitute amendment for the
GOP's FY 2018 budget resolution in part designed to start the process
for tax reform. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 108 to

### Fees On Criminal Corporations

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Creating A 2.75 Percent Fee On
Criminal Fees, Penalties, Or Settlements With Banks And Corporation That
Commit Corporate Malfeasance To Pay For A 6-1 Matching Public Financing
System For Congressional And Presidential Campaign As Part Of A Larger
Anti-Corruption And Democracy Reform Bill.** In March 2019, Fitzpatrick
voted against The 'For The People Act.' According to Vox, "HR 1 covers
three main planks: campaign finance reform, strengthening the
government's ethics laws, and expanding voting rights. Here's the
important part of each section, briefly explained. Campaign finance.
Establishing public financing of campaigns, powered by small donations.
Under the vision of the bill's main sponsor, Rep. John Sarbanes (D-MD),
the federal government would provide a voluntary 6-1 match for
candidates for president and Congress, which means for every dollar a
candidate raises from small donations, the federal government would
match it six times over. The maximum small donation that could be
matched would be capped at \$200. The most substantial change to HR 1 is
this program now won't be funded by taxpayer dollars as originally
planned; instead, it will come from adding a 2.75 percent fee on
criminal and civil fines, fees, penalties, or settlements with banks and
corporations that commit corporate malfeasance (think Wells Fargo).
Democrats are using this idea to push back on Republican attacks that
taxpayers shouldn't be subsidizing campaigns." The vote was on passage.
The House passed the bill by a vote of 234 to 193. \[House Vote 118,

### Health Insurance Executives

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The American Health Care Act That
Which Would Result In 23 Million Fewer Americans With Health Insurance
By 2026 While Also Cutting Taxes For Insurance Company Executives.** In
May 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against the American Health Care Act which
would have significantly repealed portions of the Affordable Care Act by
cutting Medicaid, cutting taxes on the rich, removing safeguard for
pre-existing conditions and defunding Planned Parenthood. According to
Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "repeal\[ed\] the
special rule for the limitation of the deduction for remuneration for
health insurance executives, which involves the deduction of
compensation for personal services as an ordinary business expense for
certain health insurance providers, to the extent that such remuneration
exceeds \$500,000 (an estimated \$400 million cost)." The overall
legislation would have in part, also according to Congressional
Quarterly, "ma\[d\]e extensive changes to the 2010 health care overhaul
law, by effectively repealing the individual and employer mandates as
well as most of the taxes that finance the current system. It would

would provide\[d\] fixed federal payments to states and end\[ed\]
additional federal funding for the 2010 law's joint federal-state
Medicaid expansion. \[...\] It would \[have\] allow\[ed\] states to
receive waivers to exempt insurers from having to provide certain
minimum benefits." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by
a vote of 217 to 213. The bill, in modified forms, died in the Senate.

-   **Legislation Repeals A Limitation On How Much Insurance Companies
    Can Deduct Executive Pay As A Business Expense.** According to CNBC,
    "The proposed tax break, buried in cryptic language in the
    Republican plan, would allow health insurers to more fully deduct
    the value of their executives' compensation on their taxes. That
    compensation can be as high as tens of millions of dollars, in the
    case of CEOs of insurers. Those deductions currently are sharply
    limited by the Affordable Care Act, which caps at a maximum of
    \$500,000 the amount of an individual executive's compensation that
    an insurer could deduct as a business expense. The cap applies to
    any executive, not just to CEOs." \[CNBC,

    limit imposed on other corporations, which is \$1 million per
    executive. The ACA closed a loophole for insurance companies enjoyed
    by other corporations, which could deduct the cost of stock options
    and other 'performance-based' pay; for insurance companies, the
    deduction cap is \$500,000 per executive, period. The idea was to

December 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, also
known as Trump's tax reform bill. According to Congressional Quarterly,
"This Conference Summary deals with the conference report on HR 1, Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act, which the House will consider Tuesday. The agreement
significantly cuts corporate and individual taxes and seeks to simply
the tax code, although most individual tax provisions would expire after
2025. It reduces the corporate tax from 35% to 21% and reduces taxation
of so-called 'pass-through' businesses where profits are taxed at the
individual rate. For corporate taxes it also establishes a 'territorial'
tax system that exempts most overseas income from U.S. taxation. Most
individual tax rate rates would be reduced, including by dropping the
top rate from 39.6% to 37%, and it eliminates personal exemptions but
nearly doubles the standard deduction so fewer taxpayers will itemize
deductions." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 227 to 203. The Senate later passed a slightly modified version
of the bill, which the House later agreed to. President Trump later
signed an amended version of the bill into law. \[House Vote 692,

    Trump Organization, which get a new deduction reducing their tax
    burden. The House-Senate compromise bill allows people with
    pass-through income to deduct a portion of that income from their
    taxes; the deduction is for 20 percent of pass-through income, less
    than the 23 percent under the Senate-passed bill." \[Vox,

-   **"Pass-Through" Businesses Are Sole Proprietorships, Partnerships,
    LLCs, and S-Corporations Whose Owners Pay Individual Income Taxes On
    The Profits.** According to CBS News, "The GOP House proposal for
    the biggest overhaul in the US tax code in some 30 years has been
    out for barely a day, but already it's being dissected to find the
    winners and losers. One of the winners most analyses have pointed to
    are people who earn their money via so-called pass-through
    businesses, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited
    liability companies (LLC) and S-corporations. Most business in the
    US are organized as one of these entities. According to the
    Brookings Institution, about 95 percent of businesses fall into that
    category. The Republicans\' pro-business tax legislation includes a
    potentially valuable break for these business\' and their owners.
    Here\'s what you need to know. Income earned by a business organized
    as a pass-through entity must be distributed as taxable income to
    its owner, members or partners. The pass-through entity itself
    doesn\'t pay income taxes, but it also can\'t defer tax on profits
    to be used later to reinvest in the business. Instead, all of its
    income is distributed each year to the individuals who own the
    pass-through entity, and they must pay tax on the profits." \[CBS

    Two-Thirds Of Pass-Through Business Income Goes To The Highest 1
    Percent Of Tax Filers.** According to the Center on Budget and
    Policy Priorities, "The Trump pass-through proposal would be an
    expensive tax cut that would flow primarily to the wealthiest
    Americans. That's because more than two-thirds of pass-through
    business income flows to the highest-income 1 percent of tax
    filers." \[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,

-   **Trump Could Save Millions Due To This Change.** According to the
    New York Times, "Mr. Trump could save as much as \$6.2 million on
    business income and \$9.8 million on income from real estate and
    other kinds of partnerships under this plan, compared with his tax
    burden under current law. (In 2005, much of this taxable income was
    offset by a \$103.2 million write-down in business losses.)" \[New

-   **Last Minute Added Provision Gave A Tax Break To Real-Estate
    Moguls.** According to the International Business Times, "President
    Donald Trump has made tens of millions of dollars of a specific kind
    of income that could be subjected to a last-minute tax break
    inserted into the Republicans' tax legislation released Friday,
    according to federal records reviewed by International Business
    Times. The same is true for Tennessee GOP Sen. Bob Corker --- a
    commercial real estate mogul who suddenly switched his vote to 'yes'
    on the tax bill after the provision was added to the legislation.
    Previously, Corker was the only Republican to vote against the
    Senate version of the bill. \[...\] The reconciled tax bill includes
    a new 20 percent deduction for so-called 'pass-through' entities,
    business structures such as LLCs, LPs and S-Corporations that don't
    pay corporate taxes, but instead 'pass through' income to partners
    who pay individual tax rates on that money. The Senate version of
    the bill included safeguards that would only allow businesses to
    take advantage of the new break if they paid out significant wages
    to employees. But the new provision, which wasn't included in either
    version of the bill passed by the House and Senate, and was only
    added during the reconciliation process, gives owners of
    income-producing real estate holdings a way around that safeguard,
    effectively creating a new tax break for large landlords and real
    estate moguls." \[International Business Times,

significantly altered the federal tax code. According to Congressional
Quarterly, "The bill substantially restructures the U.S. tax code to
simplify the code and reduce taxes on individuals, corporations and
small businesses. For individuals, it consolidates the current seven tax
brackets down to four and eliminates or restricts many tax credits and
deductions, including by eliminating the deduction for state and local
income taxes and limiting the deduction for property taxes to \$10,000
and the interest deduction for a home mortgage to the first \$500,000
worth of a loan. \[...\] On the business side, it reduces the corporate
tax from 35% to 20% and establishes a 'territorial' tax system that
would exempt most income derived overseas from U.S. corporate taxation.
It allows businesses to immediately expense 100% of the cost of assets
acquired and placed into service, and for small businesses it raises the
Section 179 expensing limit to \$5 million for five years. It also
establishes a 25% rate for a portion of pass-through business income
that would otherwise have to be paid at the ordinary individual tax
level, and for small businesses where an individual would receive less
than \$150,000 in pass-through income it taxes the first \$75,000 of
that income at a 9% rate." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 227 to 205. President Trump later signed an amended
version of the bill into law. \[House Vote 637,

-   **The Bill Significantly Altered Taxation For So-Called

    Certain Professional Firms Would Not Be Subject To The New Lower
    Rate.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "'Pass-through'
    Businesses --- Modifies the treatment of pass-through business
    income, which is generally not subject to tax at the business level
    but is taxed at the individual level when it is distributed to
    owners in the form of profits, wages, or capital gains. It
    establishes a new top 25% rate on such pass-through business income,
    but generally allows just 30% of a business\'s net income to be
    taxed at that rate, with the remainder being taxed at the
    individual\'s ordinary income rate. Services firms such as lawyers,
    accountants and physicians generally could not take advantage of
    this rate, except to the extent they have capital investments."

    regardless of where the income is earned. They\'re allowed to defer
    paying U.S. tax on their foreign profits until they bring the money
    home. Many argue that this 'worldwide' tax system puts American
    businesses at a disadvantage. That's because most foreign
    competitors come from countries with territorial tax systems,
    meaning they don't owe tax to their own governments on income they
    make offshore. The Senate bill proposes changes to move the U.S. to
    a territorial system. It also includes a number of anti-abuse
    provisions to prevent corporations with foreign profits from gaming
    the system. And it would require companies to pay a one-time low tax
    rate on their existing overseas profits \-- 14.5% on cash assets and
    7.5% on non-cash assets (e.g., equipment abroad in which profits

    into the United States by offering a much lower, one-time, 15.5% tax
    on those foreign earnings held as cash or other liquid form (versus
    14% in the House bill) and an 8% tax for any earnings that were
    reinvested in illiquid assets). Under the measure, this repatriation
    tax could be payable in escalating installments over eight years.
    The measure includes special rules for S Corporations, REITs, and

    dividend-exemption system --- which would exempt from U.S. taxation
    100% of the foreign-source portion of dividends paid by a foreign
    company to a U.S. corporation, if the U.S. company owns 10% or more
    of the foreign entity. Under the measure, U.S. corporations could
    not claim any foreign tax credit or deduction for its foreign tax
    liability with respect to exempted dividends, and no deductions for

according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new
budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal
2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap
total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and
would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for
fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to
war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of
the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the
Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program.
It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the
U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the

-   **Budget Claimed That Moving To A Territorial Tax System Is An
    Important Piece Of Tax Reform.** According to the Republican Study
    Committee FY 2018 Budget, "The damage inflicted by our uncompetitive
    tax code is readily evident in the increasing trend of so called tax
    inversions, in which U.S. companies are acquired by foreign
    companies and lower their tax burden by choosing a new national home
    located outside of the United States. The need to reform the
    international tax system has been further underscored by the OECD's
    Base Erosion and Profits Shifting (BEPS) project, which could have
    adverse impacts on U.S.-based multinational corporations. Moving to
    a territorial system where income is only taxed in the country where
    it is earned is an important piece of business tax reform. However,
    this change should take place in the context of comprehensive tax
    reform, not as part of dangerous proposals that would use
    international tax reform to 'pay' for higher spending. To be clear,
    increasing revenue through a deemed repatriation in order to finance
    more government spending is destructive of the ability of the
    economy to grow and of individuals to prosper." \[Republican Study
