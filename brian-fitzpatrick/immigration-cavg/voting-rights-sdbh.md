### Undocumented Immigrant Voting

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For A Resolution Stating That "Allowing
Illegal Immigrants The Right To Vote Devalues The Franchise And
Diminishes The Voting Power Of United States Citizens."** In September
2018, Fitzpatrick voted for a resolution that, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "state\[d\] that the House of Representatives
'recognizes that allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues
the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States
citizens.'" The House adopted the resolution by a vote of 279 to 72,
with 69 Democrats voting present. \[House Vote 406,

-   **San Francisco, For Example, Allows Undocumented Immigrants To Vote
    In School Board Elections.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in elections for
    federal office. However, some local jurisdictions do permit
    noncitizens to vote in local elections. For example, San Francisco
    permits noncitizens, including undocumented immigrants, to vote in
    school board elections, and Takoma Park, Md., permits all residents
    to vote in its city elections, regardless of their legal status."
