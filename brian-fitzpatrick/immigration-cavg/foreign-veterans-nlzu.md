# Foreign-Born Veterans

### Naturalization Benefits

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Establish A Process For Expedited
Naturalization Of Deported Veterans And Foreign-Born Military Members.**
In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick
voted for the Veteran Service Recognition Act of 2022, which would
"establish or codify procedures to provide for expedited naturalization
of noncitizen U.S. veterans. The bill would require U.S. Citizen and
Immigration Services, in coordination with the Defense Department, to
implement a program to allow all noncitizen servicemembers to apply for
naturalization at any point on or after their first day of active duty
service during a presidentially designated period of conflict with a
hostile foreign force. It would require DOD to ensure all military
recruiters are trained on the naturalization process and ensure that a
USCIS or DOD employee trained in immigration law is stationed at each
Military Entrance Processing Station to inform noncitizen recruits on
the process. It would also allow veterans honorably discharged after
active duty service during a designated contingency operation to be
naturalized under the same process. The bill would require the
Department of Homeland Security, within 180 days of enactment, to create
a protocol for identifying noncitizen veterans, create a system to
maintain information about such veterans and consider such information
before initiating any removal proceedings; establish a Military Family
Immigration Advisory Committee to review and provide recommendations
regarding any case involving removal proceedings for current
servicemembers, veterans or their immediate family members; and
establish an application and approval procedures to provide legal
permanent resident status for noncitizen veterans who have been deported
or ordered deported. The bill would also allow immediate relatives of
U.S. citizens who served at least two years in the military to apply for
legal permanent resident status." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 220-208. The Senate did not take further
action on the bill. \[House Vote 503,
