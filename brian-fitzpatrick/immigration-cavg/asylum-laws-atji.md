### Disqualifications

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted To Expand Reasons To Disqualify Individuals
From Claiming Asylum, Including Convictions For Domestic And Child
Abuse, Certain Drug Possession Or Trafficking Or DUIs, Traveling Through
Other Countries But Not Seeking Asylum In Such Countries.** In May 2023,
according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Secure
The Border Act, which would "expand reasons disqualifying individuals
from asylum eligibility, including convictions for certain offenses such
as using a false ID, domestic violence, child abuse, certain drug
possession or trafficking, and repeated or serious driving while
intoxicated; traveling through but not seeking asylum in at least one
other country party to certain refugee protection treaties; and ability
to avoid persecution by relocating to another part of their home
country." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote
of 219 to 213, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 209,

-   **The Bill Would Resume The Border Wall Construction, Raise Funding
    For Border Agents And Upgrade Border Equipment, Re-Implement The
    "Remain In Mexico Policy," Create New Restrictions On
    Asylum-Seeking, And Enhance E-Verify.** According to CNN, "The bill
    would restart construction of a border wall, increase funding for
    border agents and upgraded border technology, reinstate the 'remain
    in Mexico' policy, place new restrictions on asylum seekers, and
    enhance requirements for E-verify, a database employers use to
    verify immigration status." \[CNN,

### Grants Assisting Asylum Seekers

**2020: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted For Cutting A New Program That
Provided Grants To Organizations Assisting Asylum Seekers In The \$1.31
Trillion Six-Bill FY 2021 Appropriations Package.** In July 2020,
Fitzpatrick voted for the motion to recommit the FY 2021 six-bill
appropriations package with instructions to, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "report it back immediately with an amendment that would
decrease by \$15 million, the full amount provided, funding for a
Justice Department grant program for nonprofits to provide legal
representation to immigrants arriving at the southwest U.S. border
seeking asylum or other legal protection. It would increase by the same
amount funding for DOJ state and local law enforcement assistance
grants." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the
motion by a vote of 197-219. \[House Vote 177,

-   **Republicans Tried To Cut A \$15 Million Pilot Program Providing
    Grants To Nonprofit Organizations Helping Asylum Seekers At The
    Mexico Border.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Before final
    passage, the House rejected a motion to recommit from Republicans, a
    procedural maneuver that would have amended the bill, that would
    have eliminated \$15 million for a pilot program to provide grants
    to nonprofit organizations providing legal representation for asylum
    seekers at the Mexico border. Republicans wanted to move that
    money to the Byrne grants program, which provides funding for local,
    state and tribal police departments \[...\] the grant program would
    help reduce the backlog of claims that has led to crowded conditions
    at immigration detention facilities." \[Congressional Quarterly,

### Limiting Eligibility

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted To Limit Eligibility For Asylum Within The
U.S., Including By Specifying Asylum-Seekers Must Have Arrived At An
Official Port Of Entry And Tightening Standards For Persecution
Claims.** In May 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick
voted for the Secure The Border Act, which, "Among provisions limiting
eligibility for asylum within the United States, the bill would specify
that noncitizens are eligible for asylum only if they arrived at an
official U.S. port of entry. It would tighten standards for determining
whether an individual has a 'credible fear of persecution' and is
persecuted as part of a 'social group' or based on a 'political
opinion.'" The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote
of 219 to 213, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 209,

-   **The Bill Would Establish Strict Limits On Asylum Seekers, Require
    Asylum Seekers To Apply For U.S. Protection Outside Of The Country,
    And Continue Construction Of The Border Wall And Expand Federal Law
    Enforcement Efforts.** According to Reuters, "The package, which
    Democrats have warned will be blocked in the Senate, would set tight
    limits on asylum seekers and require them to apply for U.S.
    protection outside the country. It also would resume construction of
    a wall along the border and expand federal law enforcement efforts."

### Restricting Asylum Laws

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For The So-Called Compromise GOP Immigration
Will That Funded The Wall, Provided A Pathway To Citizenship For DACA
Recipients, And Increased Asylum Requirements For Those Seeking It.** In
June 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for the "compromise" immigration proposal
between Republican conservatives and moderates. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "Passage of the bill that would appropriate
\$23.4 billion for various border security activities. Included would be
\$16.6 billion for a 'border wall system,' which would be available from
fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2027, and \$6.8 billion for border security
investments, which would be available from fiscal 2019 through fiscal
2023. It would provide those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
status a six-year renewable contingent non-immigrant legal status and
would allow them to apply for a green card after five years, providing a
path to citizenship. It would modify legal immigration by ending the
diversity visa program and reallocating those visas to other
classifications. The bill would require that undocumented immigrants who
are charged with a misdemeanor offense for improper entry into the
United States be detained with their minor children." The vote was on
passage. The House rejected the bill by a vote of 121 to 301. \[House
Vote 297, [6/27/18](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll297.xml);

-   **Legislation Required Asylum Officers To Find A "Significant
    Possibility" That Credible Fear Exists For Those Seeking Asylum,
    That A Person Cannot Return Home Without Losing Asylum Protection,
    And Increased Penalties For Those Lying About Asylum.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Under current procedures, immigrants
    subject to expedited removal proceedings can claim a credible fear
    of persecution back in their homeland, and if found to have a
    credible fear has the right to go before a U.S. immigration judge.
    The bill requires U.S. asylum officers, in order to establish that
    credible fear exists, to find that a 'significant possibility'
    exists that a person may be found eligible for asylum or not
    deported based on that fear. It also requires that such interviews
    be recorded. The measure allows DHS to remove asylum seekers to safe
    third countries where they would have access to a full and fair
    procedure for applying for asylum, without the current necessity for
    bilateral agreements with those countries. This provision is
    intended to allow the return of apprehended Central Americans to
    Mexico, where they could apply for asylum. It also provides that
    U.S. asylum status would be terminated when an individual returns to
    their home country from which they sought asylum, absent changed
    circumstances or a change in country conditions. Finally, the bill
    provides that immigrants found to have filed a frivolous asylum
    application would be barred from receiving any future immigration
    benefits, and those making false statements in asylum applications
    could be fined and/or imprisoned for 10 years. The measure also
    increases from 5 to 10 years the statute of limitations with regard
    to charging fraud and misuse of visas, permits and other documents."
