# Immigration Restriction

### Individuals Affiliated With Communist Parties

**2022: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against An Amendment That Would
Have Prohibited Individuals Affiliated With Communists Or Totalitarian
Parties From Immigrating To The U.S. Under An H-1B Visa, Unless The
Affiliation Was Coerced.** In December 2022, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted against the "automatic adoption of the
Nadler, D-N.Y., manager\'s amendment to HR 3648 that would prohibit
individuals who are or have been affiliated with the Communist or any
totalitarian party from being admitted to the U.S. under an H-1B visa,
unless the affiliation was involuntary, occurred solely when the
individual was under 16 years of age, was necessary for them to obtain a
means of living or has been terminated for a certain number of years."
The vote was on the adoption of the rule and automatic adoption of a
manager's amendment. The House adopted the rule and adopted the
amendment by a vote of 215-201. The House did not take further action on
the bill. \[House Vote 501,
