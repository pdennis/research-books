### DACA

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For The So-Called Compromise GOP Immigration
Will That Funded The Wall, Provided A Pathway To Citizenship For DACA
Recipients, And Increased Asylum Requirements For Those Seeking It.** In
June 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for the "compromise" immigration proposal
between Republican conservatives and moderates. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "Passage of the bill that would appropriate
\$23.4 billion for various border security activities. Included would be
\$16.6 billion for a 'border wall system,' which would be available from
fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2027, and \$6.8 billion for border security
investments, which would be available from fiscal 2019 through fiscal
2023. It would provide those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
status a six-year renewable contingent non-immigrant legal status and
would allow them to apply for a green card after five years, providing a
path to citizenship. It would modify legal immigration by ending the
diversity visa program and reallocating those visas to other
classifications. The bill would require that undocumented immigrants who
are charged with a misdemeanor offense for improper entry into the
United States be detained with their minor children." The vote was on
passage. The House rejected the bill by a vote of 121 to 301. \[House

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted Against A Republican Immigration Reform
Measure Which Provided \$9.3 Billion In Wall Funding, A Three-Year
Renewable Temporary Status For DACA Recipients, And Reduced Overall
Legal Immigration By Ending The Diversity Visa Program And Restricting
Family-Based Immigration.** In June 2018, Fitzpatrick voted against a
conservative immigration reform bill. Acceding to Congressional
Quarterly, "Passage of the bill that would authorize \$24.8 billion for
fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022 for various border security activities,
including \$9.3 billion for a border wall and other physical barriers
and would provide individuals registered under the Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals program with a three-year, renewable contingent
non-immigrant legal status but with no special path to citizenship. It
would modify legal immigration by ending the diversity visa program and
restricting most family-based immigration to allow only spouses and
minor children of legal permanent residents to receive green cards. It
would increase enforcement of immigration laws within the United States,
including by requiring all employers to verify the immigration status
and eligibility of individuals seeking jobs in the United States." The
vote was on passage. The House rejected the bill by a vote of 193 to
231. \[House Vote 282,

**2018: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against Condemning Rep. Paul
Gosar's (R-AZ) Comments Asking Law Enforcement To Check Citizenship At
The State Of The Union In Response To Democrats Bringing Undocumented
Immigrants To The Event.** In February 2018, Fitzpatrick voted to kill a
resolution that would, according to the text of the resolution,
"Resolved, That the House of Representatives strongly condemns
Representative Paul Gosar for his inappropriate actions that intimidated
State of the Union guests and discredited the House of Representatives."
The vote was on a motion to table the resolution. The House agreed to
the motion, essentially killing the legislation by a vote of 231 to 187.

-   **Rep. Gosar Contacted The Capital Police And The Attorney General
    To Consider Checking ID Of Everyone Attending The State Of The
    Union.** According to the Washington Post, "Democratic lawmakers and
    activists frustrated with the pace at which Congress is moving on
    protections for 'dreamers,' undocumented immigrants brought to the
    United States as children, often point to fears of deportation.
    Stories of undocumented immigrants being arrested at courthouses
    while seeking protections from crimes or meeting with officers to
    apply for legal residency have only stoked those fears. Rep. Paul A.
    Gosar (R-Ariz.) tweeted that he contacted the U.S. Capitol Police
    and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ask law enforcement to
    consider checking the identification of all attending the State of
    the Union address. The hard-line conservative even called for
    arresting 'any illegal aliens in attendance.'" \[Washington Post,
