# Immigration Reform

### DACA Recipients

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted To Create A Fast-Track Residency Application
Process For Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals Program Recipients.**
In March 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for the American Dream and Promise Act
of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require DHS
to establish a streamlined residency application process for individuals
enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 228-197. The
Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 91,

-   **The Obama Administration's Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals
    Program Provided Work Authorizations To More Than 825,000 DREAMers
    And The Trump Administration And Several Republican States Have
    Attempted To Rescind Such Program.** According to Vox, "More than
    825,000 DREAMers have already been allowed to live and work in the
    US under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)
    program, which Trump unsuccessfully sought to undo. But a coalition
    of red states, led by Texas, is still challenging the legality of
    the program in federal court; the judge in that case is expected to
    rule any day now, leaving recipients in a precarious position."

### Parole For Undocumented Immigrants

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Providing Parole Status To Individuals
Who Entered The U.S. Before January 1, 2011, Which Would Allow Them To
Remain In The U.S. For A Five Year Period.** In November 2021,
Fitzpatrick voted against the Build Back Better act which would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "allow individuals who entered the
United States prior to Jan. 1, 2011, to receive a grant of parole
allowing them to remain temporarily in the country for a period of five
years, but no later than Sept. 30, 2021." The vote was on passage. The
House passed the bill by a vote of 220-213. \[House Vote 385,
[11/19/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll385.xml); Congressional
Quarterly, [11/19/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/385?16);
Congressional Actions, [H.R.
5376](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/actions)\]

-   **The Build Back Better Act Would Grant Work Authorization For Up To
    10 Years To Undocumented Immigrants Living In The U.S., Which Would
    Be An Attempt To Comply With Senate Rules On Reconciliation.**
    According to The Hill, "The latest version of the House's \$1.75
    trillion social spending package includes immigration provisions
    that would give up to 10 years of work authorization for
    undocumented people living in the U.S. --- an effort to comply with
    Senate rules that have killed two previous plans." \[The Hill,
    [11/3/21](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/579969-house-outlines-immigration-provisions-in-latest-build-back-better-package)\]

-   **The Build Back Better Act Would Grant Parole To Undocumented
    Immigrants Living In The U.S. Prior To 2011, Which Would Allow Them
    To Reside In The Country For A Five Year Period Until Late 2031, In
    Lieu Of Providing A Pathway To Citizenship.** According to The Hill,
    "The Build Back Better package released by the House on Wednesday
    does not provide a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11
    million undocumented people already living in the U.S. It instead
    relies on a process known as parole to waive immigration
    requirements for five years for those who have been living in the
    U.S. prior to 2011. Once approved, beneficiaries could apply for a
    five-year extension, allowing them to stay in the country until the
    end of 2031." \[The Hill,
    [11/3/21](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/579969-house-outlines-immigration-provisions-in-latest-build-back-better-package)\]

-   **The Senate Parliamentarian Previously Ruled Twice That Expansive
    Immigration Provisions, Including Pathway To Citizenship, Violated
    Budgetary Rules That Would Permit Passage Without A Republican
    Filibuster.** According to The Hill, "It's a bid to appeal to the
    Senate parliamentarian, who twice has batted down more expansive
    immigration proposals, arguing they did not meet the budgetary rules
    that allow the measure to get around a GOP filibuster." \[The Hill,
    [11/3/21](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/579969-house-outlines-immigration-provisions-in-latest-build-back-better-package)\]

-   **The Build Back Better Act Would Include Visas Recapturing, Which
    Would Preserve Approximately 222,000 Of Unused Family-Based Visas
    And About 157,000 Employment-Based Visas Susceptible To Lapse
    Otherwise.** According to The Hill, "The bill does include visa
    recapture, preserving some 222,000 unused family-based visas and
    roughly 157,000 employment-based visas that would otherwise lapse."
    \[The Hill,
    [11/3/21](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/579969-house-outlines-immigration-provisions-in-latest-build-back-better-package)\]

### Pathway To Citizenship

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted To Provide Legal Status To Undocumented
Immigrants Who Entered The U.S. As Children Or From Countries With
Temporary Protected Status Classification And To Protect Them From
Deportation.** In March 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for the American Dream
and Promise Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "provide legal residency status for certain undocumented
immigrants who entered the United States as children or from nations
with Temporary Protected Status designation and would prohibit the
Homeland Security and Justice Departments from initiating or continuing
the removal of such individuals." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 228-197. The Senate did not take
substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 91,
[3/18/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll091.xml); Congressional
Quarterly, [3/18/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/91?10);
Congressional Actions, [H.R.
6](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/6/actions)\]

-   **H.R. 6 Would Provide A Pathway To Citizenship For 2.5 Million
    Undocumented Immigrants, Including Those Who Arrived As Children.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure (HR 6) would open
    a gateway to citizenship for 2.5 million undocumented immigrants,
    including those often referred to as Dreamers, according to the
    bill's sponsors." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/18/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6167338?3)\]

-   **Republicans Opposed The Measure Citing Concerns Over A Potential
    Increase In Border Crossings.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "In the days leading up to its passage, House GOP leaders
    encouraged members to vote against the measure. Many congressional
    Republicans took to the floor to argue about the bill's impact on
    the increasing numbers of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. They
    said passing legislation that opens a path to citizenship for
    undocumented workers would encourage more migration."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/18/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6167338?3)\]

-   **Some Republicans Claimed The Bill Would Incentivize Illegal
    Immigration And Encourage An Infinite Influx Of Foreigners Into The
    U.S.** According to Vox, "Some Republicans have already warned the
    bill would 'return to the radical left-wing policies that will
    incentivize illegal immigration and promote an unending flood of
    foreign nationals into the United States.'" \[Vox,
    [3/18/21](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/12/22321668/house-immigration-reform-dream-promise-farm-worker)\]

-   **The Bill Would Provide Applications For Ten-Year Conditional
    Permanent Residency Status To Undocumented Immigrants That Entered
    The Country As Children Before January 2021, Who Resided
    Continuously In The U.S., And Graduated Or Are Enrolled In School,
    And Exclude Those With A Criminal Record Or Gang History.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Title I of the bill would
    require DHS and DOJ to grant applications for ten-year conditional
    permanent residency status to undocumented immigrants who entered
    the U.S. at age 18 or younger prior to Jan. 1, 2021, have lived
    continuously in the U.S. since that time, and have earned or are
    enrolled in a program to earn a technical, high school, or
    postsecondary degree. It would disqualify certain individuals from
    receiving such a status based on factors including criminal record,
    gang participation, or other threats to public safety."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/18/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/91?10)\]

-   **The Bill Would Grant Permanent Residency To Conditional Residents
    If They Maintain Eligibility For Conditional Residency Status And
    Meet Education, Military Service Or Employment Qualifications.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "It would require DHS to grant
    permanent resident status to conditional residents if they maintain
    eligibility for conditional residency and meet certain
    qualifications related to postsecondary education, military service,
    or employment." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/18/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/91?10)\]

-   **Undocumented Immigrants Brought Into The Country As Children Would
    Undergo A Longer Process To Acquire Citizenship Compared To
    Individuals Under Humanitarian Protections.** According to Vox,
    "DREAMers --- undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children
    --- would face a longer path to eventual citizenship." \[Vox,
    [3/18/21](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/12/22321668/house-immigration-reform-dream-promise-farm-worker)\]

-   **The Conditional Permanent Residency, Which Would Grant Work
    Authorization, Would Last For A Decade Before The Individual May
    Apply For Citizenship.** According to Vox, "This 'conditional
    status' designation would last for 10 years before they could apply
    for citizenship, but they would be allowed to work in the meantime."
    \[Vox,
    [3/18/21](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/12/22321668/house-immigration-reform-dream-promise-farm-worker)\]

-   **DREAMers May Qualify For Permanent Residency If They Serve In The
    Military For Two Years, Work For Three Years, Or Graduate From A
    Higher Education Institution.** According to Vox, "There would be
    other ways for DREAMers to be able to apply for a green card at any
    time, including serving in the military for two years, working for
    three years, or getting a degree from a higher education institution
    (or be at least two years through a bachelor's or technical
    program)." \[Vox,
    [3/18/21](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/12/22321668/house-immigration-reform-dream-promise-farm-worker)\]

-   **The Bill Would Establish A Grant Program For Non-Profits To Help
    Those Eligible With Their Applications.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "require DHS to establish a grant program for nonprofit
    organizations to assist eligible individuals in the application
    process." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/18/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/91?10)\]

-   **The Bill Would Provide For Administrative And Judicial Review For
    Individuals Whose Application May Be Denied Or Status Revoked.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for judicial and
    administrative review for individuals whose residency status is
    denied or revoked." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/18/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/91?10)\]

-   **The Bill Barred The Department Of Homeland Security From Deporting
    Individuals Who May Qualify For Residency Status Under The Bill.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit DHS from removing
    individuals who appear eligible for residency status under the
    bill\'s provisions before providing them an opportunity to apply for
    residency." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/18/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/91?10)\]

-   **The Bill Provided Applications For Permanent Residency To
    Immigrants Who Entered The U.S. From Nations Classified Under
    Temporary Protected Status As Of January 1, 2017 Or Deferred
    Enforced Departure As Of January 20, 2021.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "require DHS and DOJ to grant applications
    for permanent residency status to foreign nationals from countries
    designated for Temporary Protected Status as of Jan. 1, 2017, or
    Deferred Enforced Departure as of Jan. 20, 2021, who have lived
    continuously in the U.S. for at least three years and are not
    ineligible for admission under current immigration law."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/18/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/91?10)\]

-   **The Measure Expanded On The DREAM Act By Including Immigrants
    Under Temporary Protected Status And Deferred Enforced Departure,
    Which Grant Humanitarian Protections To Individuals From Countries
    Suffering War, Natural Disasters And Other Extraordinary
    Conditions.** According to Vox, "The Dream and Promise Act is a more
    expansive version of the mainstay Democratic immigration bill, the
    DREAM Act. While that bill covered mostly DREAMers, it did not
    address immigrants covered by Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or
    Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) --- types of humanitarian
    protection that allow citizens of countries suffering from natural
    disaster, armed conflict, or other extraordinary circumstances to
    live and work in the US free of fear of deportation." \[Vox,
    [3/18/21](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/12/22321668/house-immigration-reform-dream-promise-farm-worker)\]

-   **Individuals Covered Under The Temporary Protected Status And
    Deferred Enforced Departure Would Face A Shorter Route To Gain Legal
    Status Versus DREAMers.** According to Vox, "Humanitarian protectees
    would face a shorter route." \[Vox,
    [3/18/21](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/12/22321668/house-immigration-reform-dream-promise-farm-worker)\]

-   **Humanitarian Protectees Would Be Able To Apply For Permanent
    Residency If They Have Resided In The U.S. For More Than Three Years
    And Were Eligible For Temporary Protected Status On September 17,
    2017 Or Deferred Enforced Departure Status As Of January 20, 2021,
    And Would Be Able To Apply For Citizenship After Five Years Of Being
    Permanent Residents.** According to Vox, "These protectees would be
    allowed to apply for green cards immediately if they have resided in
    the US for at least three years and were eligible for TPS on
    September 17, 2017, or had deferred enforced departure status as of
    January 20, 2021. After five years of holding a green card, they
    would be able to apply for citizenship." \[Vox,

**2021: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against Immigration Reform To
Provide Legal Status To Undocumented Immigrants.** In March 2021,
according to Congressional Quarterly, voted for the "Jordan, R-Ohio,
motion to recommit the bill to the House Judiciary Committee." The vote
was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of
203-216. \[House Vote 90,

for House floor consideration of a joint resolution removing the
deadline for the ratification of the equal rights amendment (H J Res
17), the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act (HR 1620), the
American Dream and Promise Act (HR 6) \[...\] The rule would provide for
up to one hour of debate on each of the five measures." The vote was on
the adoption of the rule. The House adopted the rule by a vote of
216-204. \[House Vote 79,

Fitzpatrick voted against the "motion to order the previous question
(thus ending debate and possibility of amendment) on the rule (H Res
233) that would provide for House floor consideration of a joint
