# English As The National Language

### Domestic Violence

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require The Labor Secretary Have Materials
Or Resources For Domestic Violence Be Available In Non-English If
"Commonly Encountered."** In April 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for an
amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "
require the secretary of Labor to ensure any information or materials on
resources for domestic violence survivors distributed by various federal
agencies be distributed in other 'commonly encountered' languages." The
underlying legislation reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act. The
House adopted the amendment by a vote of 363 to 67. The House later
passed the underlying bill. \[House Vote 147,
