# Sanctuary Cities

### Federal Funding

**Fitzpatrick Voted To Prohibit Federal Funding To Sanctuary Cities To
Aid Undocumented Citizens.** In September 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for ,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would
prohibit 'sanctuary' cities and other jurisdictions from receiving
federal funds that they intend to use for the benefit of undocumented
immigrants who are in the United States and do not hold a lawful
immigration status. Under the bill, sanctuary jurisdictions could not
use federal funds specifically for food, shelter, health care services,
legal services and transportation for undocumented immigrants. It would
define a sanctuary jurisdiction as any state or political subdivision
(such as a county, town, village or school district), that has a
statute, ordinance, policy or practice that prohibits or restricts any
government entity or official from sending, receiving, maintaining or
exchanging with any federal, state or local government information
regarding an individual's citizenship or immigration status." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 219 to 186.

### Prohibiting Sanctuary Cities From Receiving Funding

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Codifying President Trump's
Executive Order Defunding So-Called Sanctuary Cities.** In October 2017,
Fitzpatrick voted against a budget resolution that would in part,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new
budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal
2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap
total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and
would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for
fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to
war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of
the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the
Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program.
It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the
U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the
budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget
resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281.

-   **Budget Called For Codifying President Trump's Executive Order
    Defunding So-Called Sanctuary Cities** According to the Republican
    Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Prohibit Subsidies for Sanctuary
    Cities There are over 300 so-called sanctuary cities across the
    country, which fail to fulfill their obligation to cooperate with
    federal immigration enforcement officials and report criminal
    aliens.349 If these cities and counties refuse to follow federal
    law, they should not receive the benefits of federal funding. The
    president has issued an executive order to withhold federal grants
    from jurisdictions that fail to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373, with
    exceptions deemed necessary for law enforcement.350 While this is an
    important first step in upholding the law, Congress should codify
    the prohibition on taxpayer funding for sanctuary cities."

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The House GOP's FY 2018 Omnibus That
Included Blocking Funding For So-Called Sanctuary Cities.** In September
2017, Fitzpatrick voted for an FY 2018 Omnibus appropriations bill that.
According to The Hill, "The House on Thursday completed its work on the
annual appropriations bills for 2018, ahead of expected negotiations at
the end of this year to keep the government funded. By a vote of
211-198, the House passed a \$1.2 trillion package of spending bills to
fund wide swaths of the federal government, ranging from the Department
of Homeland Security to the Environmental Protection Agency. \[...\] The
package included eight new bills, plus four previously passed
appropriations bills that advanced through the House in July. Regular
order for appropriations typically involved passing each of the bills
individually, not in groups of 4 or 8. \[...\] Together, the bills
appropriate \$621.5 billion for defense spending and \$511 billion for
nondefense discretionary spending. It also devotes another \$87 billion
in Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) funding, which does not count
toward budget cuts. Of that, \$75 billion went to defense, \$12 billion
to nondefense." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 211 to 198. The Senate took no substantive action on the overall
legislation. \[House Vote 528,

-   **Legislation Blocked Certain Funding For So-Called Sanctuary
    Cities.** According to The Hill, "The House also adopted an
    amendment sponsored by Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) to punish so-called
    sanctuary cities by blocking funds from a program that helps pay to
    incarcerate immigrants in the U.S. illegally who have committed
    felonies or multiple misdemeanors. Sanctuary cities argue that laws
    forcing them to turn over anyone they suspect of being in the
    country illegally worsen crime, because immigrants are hesitant to
    call the police. The amendment would force the cities to choose
    between that policy and receiving funds to incarcerate people in the
    country illegally who have committed felonies." \[The Hill,
    [9/14/17](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/350670-house-passes-12t-government-funding-package-for-2018)\]

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Prohibit HUD Funds From Going To Sanctuary
Cities.** In September 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment that
would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] state
and local government entities from receiving Housing and Urban
Development Department funding if the state or local entity prohibits or
restricts any government entity from reporting to Immigration and
Naturalization Service with information regarding the citizenship or
immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual." The
underlying legislation was a legislative vehicle for an FY 2018 Omnibus
appropriations bill. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 255 to
195. The House later passed the underlying bill. The Senate took no
substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 455,

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For Legislation That Restricted Federal
Funding To Local Law Enforcement In Sanctuary Cities.** In June 2017,
Fitzpatrick voted for legislation that would have, according to
Congressional Quarterly "prohibit\[ed\] federal, state and local
governments from restricting any federal, state, or local government
entity or official from complying with immigration laws or from
assisting federal law enforcement entities or officials in their
enforcement of such laws. The bill would \[have\] allow\[ed\] the
Homeland Security Department to issue detainers for arrests of
individuals in violation of 'any criminal or motor vehicle law' in cases
where there is probable cause to believe such individual is an
'inadmissible or deportable alien,' and would revoke eligibility for
certain federal law enforcement grants for states and cities found not
to be in compliance with the bill's provisions." The House passed the
bill by a vote of 228 to 195. The Senate took no substantive action on
the legislation. \[House Vote 342,

-   **The "No Sanctuary For Criminals Act" Would Cut Federal Funding For
    Local Law Enforcement In "Sanctuary Cities" Across The Nation:**
    According to Think Progress, "The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, or
    H.R. 3003, which targets so-called 'sanctuary cities' and would
    demand cities and localities across the country comply with requests
    from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), overruling the
    advice of local law enforcement, many of whom argue the measures are
    a public safety threat. But if cities fail to comply, the bill
    threatens to withhold federal funding for a number of crucial
    endeavors" \[Think Progress,

-   **The "No Sanctuary For Criminals Act" Would Cut Funding For Opioid
    Treatment:** According to Think Progress, "But if cities fail to
    comply, the bill threatens to withhold federal funding for a number
    of crucial endeavors --- including efforts to \[...\] combat opioid
    addiction." \[Think Progress,
