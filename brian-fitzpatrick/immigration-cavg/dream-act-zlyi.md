-   **The American Dream And Promise Acts Created A Pathway To
    Citizenship For Several Groups Of Legal Residents.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The legislation would provide legal status
    and a path to citizenship for undocumented adults who were brought
    to the United States as children by their undocumented parents, and
    who are colloquially known as Dreamers. It also grants legal status
    to people living in the United States under the Temporary Protected
    Status and Deferred Enforced Departure programs. Under the measure,
    if Dreamers, TPS and DED holders meet certain education, employment
    or military service requirements they could become permanent legal
    residents after which they could proceed through the naturalization
    process to become U.S. citizens." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Center For American Progress: Over 2.5 Million Immigrants Would Be
    Eligible For Citizenship.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "The Center for American Progress, in partnership with the
    University of Southern California\'s Center for the Study of
    Immigrant Integration issued a report that estimated 2.1 million
    immigrants would be eligible under the measure for Dreamers and
    460,000 immigrants would be eligible under the measures for TPS and
    DED recipients. More than 300,000 people with TPS protections live
    in the United States from 10 countries including Nepal, Nicaragua,
    Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Syria. The DED program protects
    about 4,000 Liberian immigrants in the United States."

-   **The Trump Administration Rebuked The Bill, Stating It Would
    "Incentivize And Reward Illegal Immigration."** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans assailed the bill, stating it
    would encourage more migrants to come to the U.S.-Mexico border,
    which is experiencing a huge influx of people from Central America
    \[...\] The Trump administration issued a statement earlier Tuesday
    threatening to veto the bill if it advances out of the Senate. 'H.R.
    6 would incentivize and reward illegal immigration while ignoring
    and undermining key administration immigration objectives and policy
    priorities, such as protecting our communities and defending our
    borders,' the Office of Budget and Management said in a statement."
