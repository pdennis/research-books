# Undocumented Farm Workers

### Certified Agricultural Worker Status

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted To Provide Eligible Undocumented Workers A
Pathway To Apply For Certified Agricultural Worker Status And Eventually
Permanent Residency Status.** In March 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for the
Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2021 which would, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "allow certain undocumented agricultural
workers in the United States to apply for certified agricultural worker
status and subsequently permanent residency status \[...\] The bill
would allow undocumented agricultural workers who have worked for at
least 180 work days in the previous two years and lived continuously in
the U.S. since that time to apply for certified agricultural worker
status, which would allow them to continue working in the U.S. for five
and a half years. It would also allow such individuals to eventually
apply for legal permanent resident status (a green card), if they have
worked in agriculture for at least 10 years prior to enactment and at
least 4 years as a certified agricultural worker, or for at least 8
years as a certified agricultural worker." The vote was on passage. The
House passed the bill by a vote of 247-174. The Senate did not take
substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 93,

-   **With Approximately 1 Million Undocumented Farm Workers Residing In
    The U.S., The Legislation Would Offer Them, Their Spouses And
    Children A Pathway To Legal Status.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The legislation would expand the H-2A visa program that
    provides agricultural employers with temporary foreign workers while
    offering undocumented farm laborers, spouses and minor children
    already in the U.S. a path to legal status. About half of all farm
    workers, an estimated 1 million people, are in the country
    illegally." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/18/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6167166?1)\]

-   **The Bill Would Create A System For Farm Workers To Acquire
    Temporary Status And Followed By The Option To Seek Permanent
    Residency.** According to NPR, "The House also approved the Farm
    Workforce Modernization Act, which would establish a system for
    agricultural workers to earn temporary status with an eventual
    option to become a permanent resident." \[NPR,

-   **Agriculture Workers Who Have Worked In The Industry For At Least
    180 Days Over The Last Two Years Would Be Able To Apply For
    Certified Agricultural Worker Status And Seek Renewals.** According
    to Vox, "The bill would give farmworkers who have worked in
    agriculture for at least 180 days over the past two years the
    ability to apply for 'Certified Agricultural Worker' status, which
    can be renewed in six-month or five-year increments if they continue
    to work in agriculture for at least 100 days a year." \[Vox,
    [3/18/21](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/12/22321668/house-immigration-reform-dream-promise-farm-worker)\]

-   **Long-Term Farm Workers Would Be Offered A Pathway To Permanent
    Residency, Which Would Require At Least Four More Years Of Work
    Experience In The Agriculture Industry And A \$1,000 Fee.**
    According to Vox, "It also offers long-term farmworkers a path to a
    green card, which requires at least four more years of experience in
    the industry and a \$1,000 fee." \[Vox,
    [3/18/21](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/12/22321668/house-immigration-reform-dream-promise-farm-worker)\]

-   **Congress Has Been Struggling On How To Address Agricultural Labor
    Shortages And Decrease Dependence On Undocumented Workers.**
    According to Vox, "Congress has been wrestling with how to respond
    to labor shortages in agriculture and reduce the industry's reliance
    on undocumented workers ever since." \[Vox,
    [3/18/21](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/12/22321668/house-immigration-reform-dream-promise-farm-worker)\]

-   **The Bill Would Prevent DHS From Deporting Eligible Undocumented
    Farm Workers Before They Are Able To Apply For The Bill's Program,
    Require DHS To Create A Grant Program For Non-Profits To Help
    Eligible Workers With Their Applications, And Provide Hardship
    Waivers For Certain Workers.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Among other provisions, it would prohibit DHS from removing
    individuals who appear eligible for a status under the bill's
    provisions before providing them an opportunity to apply; require
    DHS to establish a grant program for nonprofit organizations to
    assist eligible individuals in the application process; and provide
    for hardship waivers for workers unable to fully satisfy lawful
    permanent residence work requirements due to age or disability."

**2021: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against The Farm Workforce
Modernization Act Of 2021.** In March 2021, according to Congressional

according to Congressional Quarterly, "direct the Homeland Security
secretary to establish a hardship waiver for agricultural workers unable

### Legal Resident Status

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Farm Workforce Modernization Act
(FWMA), Which Granted Legal Status To Thousands Of Undocumented
Farmworkers.** In December 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that
would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "allow certain undocumented
agricultural workers in the United States to apply for permanent
residency status." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by
a vote of 260-165. \[House Vote 674,
[12/11/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll674.xml); Congressional
Quarterly, [12/11/19](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2019/H/674?60);

-   **The FWMA Allowed Undocumented Farmworkers To Apply For Legal
    Permanent Resident Status And Expand The H-2A Visa Program.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure would allow
    individuals to gain legal 'certified agriculture worker' status and
    eventually apply for legal permanent resident status by
    demonstrating experience working in the U.S. agricultural industry.
    It also would remove certain requirements on employers who apply and
    participate in the H-2A visa program, which allows U.S. employers to
    bring low-skilled workers from overseas for temporary or seasonal
    agricultural work, set wage requirements for the program and place
    caps on year-to-year increases and decreases for wages for H-2A
    workers. It also would mandate use of the E-Verify program, which
    allows employers to confirm a person's eligibility to work in the
    U.S., in the agricultural industry." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [11/20/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/committees-20191120430132?65)\]

-   **The FWMA Also Allowed Farmworkers To Request Five-Year Visas For
    Their Immediate Family.** According to The Hill, "The bill would
    allow foreign workers who\'ve worked in the U.S. agricultural sector
    for at least 180 days over the past two years to request five-year
    visas for themselves, their spouses and their minor children. Those
    visas would be renewable for workers who prove they\'ve worked in
    agriculture for more than 100 hours per year. And some beneficiaries
    would be amenable to legal permanent residence, the prelude to
    citizenship, by paying a \$1,000 fine." \[The Hill,
    [12/11/19](https://thehill.com/latino/474210-house-passes-bill-that-would-give-legal-status-to-thousands-of-undocumented)\]

-   **The FWMA Placed Limitations On Access To Social Services And A Cap
    On Wage Growth.** According to The Hill, "The bill also provides
    limitations on access to social services for its beneficiaries, a
    cap on wage growth and universal implementation in participating
    sectors of the E-Verify program, a federal database designed to
    ensure workers applying for jobs are legally eligible for employment
    in the United States. \[The Hill,
    [12/11/19](https://thehill.com/latino/474210-house-passes-bill-that-would-give-legal-status-to-thousands-of-undocumented)\]

-   **Proponents Believed The FWMA Would Ameliorate Labor Shortages In
    The U.S. Agriculture Industry.** According to The Hill, "The bill\'s
    proponents hope the measure could ameliorate a labor shortage in
    U.S. agriculture, an issue that\'s been aggravated by a complicated
    visa process and and enhanced immigration enforcement." \[The Hill,
    [12/11/19](https://thehill.com/latino/474210-house-passes-bill-that-would-give-legal-status-to-thousands-of-undocumented)\]

-   **New American Economy: FWMA Would Help Fill Gaps In The Agriculture
    Labor Force, Bolster The U.S.'s Ability To Grow Labor-Intensive
    Fruit, And Expand Agriculture Adjacent Industries Such As
    Trucking.** According to New American Economy, "Research from New
    American Economy finds that supporting immigrant farmworkers would
    help: Fill crucial gaps in the agricultural labor force not met by
    U.S.-born workers \[...\] Bolster our country's ability to produce
    labor-intensive fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts \[...\] \[and\]
    Expand related non-farm industries like trucking, marketing, and
    equipment manufacturing. \$3.1 billion in additional farm production
    would lead to almost \$2.8 billion in added spending on related
    services, and it would create more than 41,000 additional non-farm
    jobs each year." \[New American Economy,
    [11/8/19](https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/press-release/new-american-economy-endorses-the-farm-workforce-modernization-act-of-2019/)\]

-   **CATO Institute: The FWMA Would "Expand The Liberty Of
    Americans."** According to the CATO Institute, "The Farm Workforce
    Modernization Act of 2019 would expand the liberty of Americans to
    employ, contract, and associate with foreign farm workers and their
    families. H.R. 5038 reduces costly and destabilizing government
    intervention into the farm labor market by easing the legal
    employment of foreign workers --- both for those in the country
    already and those who wish to enter in the future. These changes
    will grow the U.S. economy, make America's farmers more competitive
    internationally, and reduce unnecessary taxpayer‐​funded
    enforcement." \[CATO Institute,
    [11/20/19](https://www.cato.org/publications/public-comments/statement-hr-5038-farm-workforce-modernization-act-2019)\]

-   **Some Republicans Opposed The Bill, Calling It An "Amnesty Bill For
    People Who Violated U.S. Immigrant Laws."** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "opponents said the bill unnecessarily
    allows people who entered the U.S. illegally to become certified
    agricultural workers if they meet certain standards and gives them
    the potential to become U.S. citizens. Rep. Tom McClintock,
    R-Calif., called it an amnesty bill for people who violated U.S.
    immigration laws. McClintock said time would be better spent on
    legislation to 'secure our borders, enforce our immigration laws'
    \[...\] \[Rep. Ken\] Buck said the bill didn\'t include strong
    enough vetting procedures to ensure that criminals are
    prevented from attaining legal status and didn\'t ensure that once
    someone qualified for a certified agricultural worker status and a
    five-year visa that they would remain in agriculture."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [12/11/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5791009?71)\]

-   **Other Republicans Opposed The Bill Because It Would Benefit
    Certain Agricultural Sectors More Than Others.** According to The
    Hill, "Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the top Republican on the
    Judiciary Committee, said the bill would benefit large dairies but
    would not have a meaningful impact on Georgia\'s agriculture. 'I\'m
    not questioning the motives, I just don\'t think it was put together
    real well,' said Collins. Collins added he\'s hopeful to sit down
    with Lofgren and Senate leaders to work out a bill to improve on the
    existing proposal. And Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) the ranking
    Republican on the Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee, complained
    that Republican amendments were left out in the bill\'s markup."
