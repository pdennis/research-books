### Waivers During National Emergencies And Supply Chain Disruptions

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Allow The Agriculture Department To Provide
Waivers Of Administrative Requirements For State Agencies Administering
The Program For Women, Infants And Children (WIC) During A National
Emergency Or Supply Chain Shortage.** In May 2022, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Access to Baby
Formula Act of 2022, which would "allow the Agriculture Department to
waive administrative requirements for state agencies administering the
supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children (WIC) if
the requirements cannot be met during and for up to 60 days after the
end of a national emergency or disaster period or a supply chain
disruption." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 414-9, thus the bill was sent to the Senate and President and
ultimately became law. \[House Vote 218,

    Baby Formula Act, a bill that would give emergency authority to the
    WIC federal nutrition program to relax some non-safety-related
    regulations." \[Wall Street Journal,
