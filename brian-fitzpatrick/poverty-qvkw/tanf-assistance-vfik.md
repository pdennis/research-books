# Temporary Assistance For Needy Families (TANF)

### Reauthorization

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Continuing Appropriations Bill For All
But Homeland Security That Would End That Partial Government Shutdown As
Well As Extend TANF Through The End Of FY 2020.** In January 2019,
Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"provide\[d\] \$271.8 billion for full-year fiscal 2019 funding for six
of the seven spending bills that reached a conference agreement, but
that lack enacted appropriations (all except Homeland Security) and
would \[have\] extend\[ed\] authorization for several expiring programs
including the National Flood Insurance Program and the Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families." The vote was on a passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 234 to 180. \[House Vote 49,
[1/23/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll049.xml); Congressional
Quarterly, [1/23/19](http://cq.com/vote/2019/H/49?1); Congressional
Actions, [H.R.
648](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/648/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Extended TANF Through The End FY 2020.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "It extends certain TANF programs through
    FY 2020, and also extends Medicaid\'s Money Follows the Person
    Rebalancing Demonstration and certain spousal impoverishment rules.
    The measure reduces the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP)
    for Medicaid to states without asset verification programs, and
    rescinds \$25 million from the Medicaid Improvement Fund."
