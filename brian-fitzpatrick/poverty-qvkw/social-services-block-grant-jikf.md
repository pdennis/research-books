# Social Services Block Grant

### Elimination

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating The Social
Services Block Grants.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a
budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal
2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by
\$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending
at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas
Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and
would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense
account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and
would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into
a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs,
such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was
an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC
budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555,

-   **Budget Called For The Elimination Of The Social Services Block
    Grants.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018
    Budget, "Eliminate the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) The Social
    Services Block Grant (SSBG) program provides funding to states that
    can be used for a wide range of social programs. However, this
    funding is duplicative of many other federal programs. The single
    largest use of these funds is to cover states' administrative costs
    of providing information and referrals to government programs. The
    SSBG should be eliminated, saving more than \$17 billion over the
    next decade." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed
