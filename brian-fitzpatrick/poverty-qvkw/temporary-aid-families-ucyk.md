# Temporary Aid For Needy Families

### Funding

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For Extending Funding For Temporary Aid For
Needy Families (TANF) Through September 30, 2019.** In June 2019,
Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that would, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "extend authorization and funding through September 30, 2019
for the Temporary Aid for Needy Families program and related Health and
Human Service Department programs, including family assistance and child
care grants, to states and territories." The vote was a motion to
suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House passed the bill by a vote
of 357 to 55. The bill was then passed by the Senate and signed by the
President to become law. \[House Vote 233,
