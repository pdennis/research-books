### Repealing A Rule That Requires That Only Effectively Performing Teacher's Preparatory Schools Receive TEACH Grants

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Disapprove A Rule Requiring States To Rank
Teacher's Preparatory Schools And Publically Release Information Such As
Recent Graduation Retention; Only Schools That Have Been Effective For
Two Out Of The Previous Three Years Can Receive TEACH Grants.** In
February 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for disapproving a rule via the
Congressional Rule Act that required states to annually evaluate teacher
preparation programs via the Congressional Review Act. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "This resolution disapproves the rule issued by
the Education Department on Oct. 31, 2016, relating to teacher
preparation programs (commonly known as the Teacher Preparation Issues
Rule) that requires states to annually evaluate the effectiveness of
teacher preparation programs at institutes of higher education and to
publicly report this information. The measure provides that the rule
will have no force or effect." The vote was on the resolution. The House
adopted the resolution by a vote of 240 to 181. The president later
signed the legislation into law. \[House Vote 85,

-   **The Rule Required That States Annually Evaluate Teacher's
    Preparation Schools And Publically Report Information Such As
    Placement And Retention Rates; Programs Must Be Ranked On Three
    Levels Of Performance.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    Education Department in October 2016 issued its final rule on
    Teacher Preparation Issues. The rule requires states to annually
    evaluate the effectiveness of teacher preparation programs at
    institutions of higher education and to publicly report on: the
    placement and retention rates of graduates in their first three
    years of teaching, including placement and retention in high-need
    schools; feedback from graduates and their employers on the
    effectiveness of the program; student learning outcomes; and other
    program characteristics, including assurances of program
    accreditation and that graduates can meet rigorous exit
    requirements. States may require additional measures of efficacy,
    and programs must be ranked on at least three levels of performance,
    with states required to provide technical assistance to
    low-performing programs to help them improve." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [2/3/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5034970/10?2)\]

-   **TEACH Grants Could Only Be Provided To Schools That Have Been
    Effective For Two Of The Past Three Years Under The Rankings.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Under the rule, federal TEACH
    grants could be provided only to students in teacher preparation
    programs that are rated by the state to have been effective for at
    least two of the previous three years. (Students who receive TEACH
    grants must agree to serve as full-time teachers at low-income
    schools teaching in a high-need field for at least four academic
    years within eight years of graduating.)" \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/3/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5034970/10?2)\]

-   **2011: Obama White House Noted That In The Previous Decade, The
    Majority Of States Did Not Rate A Single Teacher's Preparatory
    Program As Inferior.** According to the Atlantic, "In 2011, U.S.
    Secretary of Education Arne Duncan called it 'laughable' that in the
    prior decade the majority of states had failed to rate even one
    teaching preparation program as inferior. On Tuesday, the White
    House released draft regulations that are no joke for the nation's
    teacher colleges and could result in a loss of federal funding if
    their graduates fail to do well on the job. In his conversation with
    reporters Tuesday to announce the proposed changes, Duncan noted
    that when it comes to cracking down on inferior teacher prep
    programs, 34 states are in the midst of a 12-year draught." \[The

-   **The Teacher Education Assistance For College And Higher Education
    (TEACH) Grant Program Provides \$4,000 Per Year Grants To Students
    Who Will Teach For Four Years At Schools That Serve Low-Income
    Families.** According to StudentAid.gov, "The Teacher Education
    Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program
    provides grants of up to \$4,000 per year to students who agree to
    teach for four years at an elementary school, secondary school, or
    educational service agency that serves students from low-income
    families and to meet other requirements." \[StudentAid.gov,
