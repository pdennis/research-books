### Native American Language Resources

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Authorize \$3 Million Annually For The
Education Department To Establish A Native American Language Center To
Improve The Teaching And Learning Of Indigenous Languages.** In December
2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for a bill
that would "authorize \$3 million annually for the Education Department,
through a grant or contract with an institution of higher education, to
establish a Native American language resource center to improve the
teaching, learning and use of Native American languages. It would also
authorize the center to support the use of Native American languages
within education systems in the same manner as other world languages and
provide assistance to Native American language programs." The vote was
on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 342-71, thus the bill
was sent to President Biden and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote
