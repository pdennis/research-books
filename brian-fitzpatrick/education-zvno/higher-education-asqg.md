congressional homeland security committees a report containing
information on higher education institutions with a relationship to a
Confucius Institute or Chinese entity of concern and receive DHS

### Financial Aid

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Amend Eligibility For Pell Grants.** In
February 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional
Quarterly, "the bill that would extend stopgap funding through March 8,
2024, for the Agriculture, Energy-Water, Military Construction-VA and
Transportation-HUD spending bills; and would extend funding through
March 22, 2024, for the Commerce-Justice-Science, Defense, Financial
Services, Homeland Security, Interior-Environment, Labor-HHS-Education,
Legislative Branch and State-Foreign Operations spending bills. It also
would establish a temporary negative \$1,500 student income contribution
floor for calculating Pell Grants for award year 2024-2025. It would set
the income contribution floor at zero for award year 2025-2026 and each
award year thereafter. It also would increase funding provided to carry
out the Pell Grant program from the current level of \$1.2 billion in
fiscal 2024 to \$3.2 billion for fiscal 2025, \$2.2 billion for fiscal
2026 and \$1.2 billion for fiscal 2027 and each succeeding fiscal year."
The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 320 to
99. \[House Vote 58,

-   **The Language Blocked An Education Department Attempt At Expanding
    Eligibility For Pell Grants As A Projected Deficit Approached.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "the fast-moving stopgap
    spending bill introduced Wednesday would block an Education
    Department move announced just a day earlier that Republicans say
    could have expanded Pell Grant eligibility for roughly 280,000
    college students in the upcoming academic year. The new language
    added to the continuing resolution (HR 7463), which takes up five
    out of the otherwise skinny bill's six pages, is estimated to save
    about \$3 billion next year. Beginning in fiscal 2025, that money
    would be plowed back into the Pell Grant program, which even prior
    to the administration's Tuesday decision was already projected to
    dip into deficit after years of surplus. That deficit will need to
    be backfilled by appropriators who are already faced with tight
    budget caps. And without the fix provided in the stopgap measure,
    the Pell shortfall could grow as large as \$7 billion in fiscal
    2025, according to GOP staff on the House Education and the
    Workforce Committee." \[Congressional Quarterly,

valued at \$50,000 or more, instead of the current \$250,000 threshold.
Among other provisions, the bill would generally prohibit colleges and
universities from entering into contracts with foreign countries of
concern or foreign entities of concern. It would require institutions to
disclose any gifts they receive from such countries or entities, private
institutions to disclose whether their endowments are invested in assets

and existing student loan borrowers, which would operate as a
replacement for the Revised Pay-As-You-Earn plan. The rule would take
effect on July 1, 2024. However, in the wake of a Supreme Court decision
the Education Department implemented the program in August 2023. Under
the provisions of the joint resolution, the Education Department rule
would have no force or effect." The vote was on passage. The House
