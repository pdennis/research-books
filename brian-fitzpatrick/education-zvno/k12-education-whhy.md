# K-12 Education

### Communism And Totalitarianism

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require The Victims Of Communism Memorial
Foundation To Develop A High School Curriculum On Communism And
Totalitarianism.** In December 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according
to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would require
the nonprofit Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation to develop a high
school civic education curriculum to promote the understanding of
certain political ideologies, including communism and totalitarianism,
and compare how they conflict with U.S. principles of freedom and
democracy. The bill would require the curriculum to be compatible with a
variety of school courses (including social studies, government, history
and economics classes). It also would direct the foundation to develop
associated oral history resources that could be used with the curriculum
and include personal stories from individuals who are victims of
communism and totalitarianism who can compare those ideologies with U.S.
democracy. As amended, it would require the Victims of Communism
Memorial Foundation-developed high school civic education curriculum to
be updated periodically to include past and present communist and
totalitarian regimes. It also would direct the foundation to engage with
local and state educational leaders to assist high schools using the
curriculum and oral history resources." The House passed the bill by a
vote of 327 to 62. \[House Vote 492,

### Dangerous Weapon Educational Programs

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted To Allow Federal Funds To Be Used In
Educational Programs Involving Dangerous Weapons.** In September 2023,
according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the "motion
to suspend the rules and pass the bill, as amended, that would allow
federal funds appropriated for elementary and secondary education to be
used for educational instruction or extracurricular activities that
involve the use of a dangerous weapon, such as archery, hunting, other
shooting sports or culinary arts." The vote was on passage. The House
agreed to the motion by a vote of 424 to 1, thus the bill was sent to

### School Lunch

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted To Allow National School Lunch Program
Participating Schools To Serve Whole Milk.** In December 2023, according
to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for "the bill, as amended,
that would allow schools to participate in the National School Lunch
Program to serve whole or 2 percent reduced-fat milk to students,
including flavored and unflavored milk. It would also modify the Richard
B. Russell School Lunch Act to require participating schools to offer a
variety of milk options to students who don\'t conform to the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans requirements. The bill would allow schools to
serve flavored or unflavored whole milk, 2% reduced-fat milk, 1% low-fat
milk, fat-free milk, and lactose-free milk to students. The bill would
exclude the saturated fat found in milk from counting towards the amount
of saturated fats allowed under the National School Lunch Program\'s
minimum nutritional requirements for an average meal. As amended, the
bill would allow schools to serve organic or non-organic whole milk;
prohibit schools participating in the National School Lunch Program from
purchasing or offering milk produced by any company owned or operated by
a Chinese entity; and bar the Agriculture Department from prohibiting
any school participating in the National School Lunch Program from
offering students flavored and unflavored whole, reduced-fat, low-fat
and fat-free fluid milk and lactose-free fluid milk." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 330 to 99, thus the bill
was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 718,
