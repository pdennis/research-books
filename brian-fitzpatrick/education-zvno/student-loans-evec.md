### Consumer Protections

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Exempting Regulations Related To
Consumer Protections On Student Loan From The SCRUB Act, Which Would
Require Agencies To Eliminate Old Rules In Order To Create New Ones.**
In March 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against an amendment that would have,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "exempt\[ed\] from the bill's
provisions rules related to providing consumer protections for student
loan borrowers." The underlying legislation, also according to
Congressional Quarterly, "establish\[ed\] a nine-member commission to
review existing federal regulations and identify regulations that should
be repealed on the basis of reducing costs on the U.S. economy. The
commission would identify those regulatory policies that should be
repealed immediately, and would set up a 'Cut-Go' system that would
require agencies to repeal existing rules to offset costs before issuing
a new rule. The measure, as amended, would require the commission to
review a rule or regulation's unfunded mandate, whether the rule or
regulation limits or prevents government agencies from adopting
technology to improve efficiency, and the rule or regulation's impact on
wage growth, when determining if the rule or regulation should be
repealed." The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the
amendment by a vote of 191 to 235. \[House Vote 109,

### Discharged Loans

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Discharging Student Loans When A
Student Dies Or Becomes Permanently Disabled.** In May 2021, Fitzpatrick
voted against the Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act of 2021
which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require lenders to
discharge private education loans when a student borrower dies or is
permanently disabled, including for any cosigners of the loan." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 215-207. The
Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 141,

### Fraud

**2020: Fitzpatrick Voted For Overturning A Trump Administration Rule
That Rolled Back Protections For Student Loan Borrowers.** In June 2020,
Fitzpatrick voted for overriding President Trump's veto on a joint
resolution that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide
for congressional disapproval of a September 2019 Education Department
rule establishing new policies related to federal student loan
forgiveness for borrowers who attended schools that committed fraud or
any type of institutional misrepresentation, requiring such borrowers to
demonstrate financial harm as a result of the fraud to receive complete
or partial cancellation of student loan debt. The rule would also allow
for mandatory arbitration agreements related to such claims and require
borrowers to file claims within three years of leaving an institution.
The rule is currently scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2020. Under
the provisions of the joint resolution, the 2019 rule would have no
force or effect, and October 2016 rules that provide for complete
cancellation of federal student loan debt for defrauded borrowers would
be effectively maintained." The vote was on passage over President
Trump's veto. The House failed to override the President's veto by a
vote of 238-173. \[House Vote 120,

    standard for eliminating student debt when students argue they were
    defrauded by a university. The rule would require defrauded
    borrowers to demonstrate financial harm as a result of the fraud in
    order to have their debt partially or completely canceled, and it

    administration rule that Republicans said is overreaching and costly
    to taxpayers. Democrats say the Trump rule puts too much of a burden

### In School Subsidies

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating In-School
Undergraduate Student Loan Subsidies.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick
voted against a budget resolution that would in part, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget
authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by
reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total
discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would
assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal
2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or
terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010
health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's
Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would
require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S.
Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the
budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget
resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281.

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating In-School Undergraduate Student Loan
    Subsidies.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018
    Budget, "Eliminate In-School Subsidies for Undergraduates Under
    current law, interest does not accrue for undergraduate students who
    take advantage of federally subsidized student loans. Meanwhile,
    recent reforms eliminated the in-school subsidy for graduate
    students. This budget proposes to also eliminate the in-school
    subsidy for undergraduate students, which would ask a typical
    student to repay only \$37 more per month while savings taxpayers
    almost \$30 billion over the next decade.298 Importantly, this
    reform would also more accurately show the true cost of these loans
    to students and parents, encouraging them to properly weigh the
    risks, costs, and benefits of using federal financing and
    incentivizing students to pursue studies likely to result in careers
    worth the cost of their degree." \[Republican Study Committee,

### Income-Based Repayment

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The House GOP FY 2018 Budget
Resolution, Which Started The Process Towards Tax Reform, Called For
Ending Medicare As We Know It And Called Eliminating The Expanded
Income-Based Repayment Program.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted
against the House GOP FY 2018 budget resolution. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "Adoption of the concurrent resolution that
would provide for \$3.2 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018,
not including off-budget accounts. It would assume \$1.22 trillion in
discretionary spending in fiscal 2018. It would assume the repeal of the
2010 health care overhaul law. It also would propose reducing spending
on mandatory programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and changing
programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (also
known as food stamps). It would call for restructuring Medicare into a
'premium support' system beginning in 2024. I would also require the
House Ways and Means Committee to report out legislation under the
budget reconciliation process that would provide for a revenue-neutral,
comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. tax code and would include
instructions to 11 House committees to trigger the budget reconciliation
process to cut mandatory spending. The concurrent resolution would
assume that, over 10 years, base (non-Overseas Contingency Operations)
discretionary defense spending would be increased by a total of \$929
billion over the Budget Control Act caps and non-defense spending be
reduced by \$1.3 trillion." The vote was on passage. The House passed
the budget resolution by a vote of 219 to 206. A modified version was
later agreed to by both the House and the Senate. \[House Vote 557,

    to Congressional Quarterly, "Student Loans --- Repeal certain
    mandatory education funding made available under the 2010 Student
    Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act (including expansion of the
    Income-Based Repayment program); eliminate in-school interest
    subsidies for undergraduate students; and terminate the Public
    Service Loan Forgiveness and the Teacher Loan Forgiveness programs."

### Payment Pause

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Fiscal Responsibility Act Of 2023,
Which Statutorily Ended The Pause On Student Loan Payments On August 29,
2023.** In May 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick
voted for the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which would, in part,
"statutorily end the pause on student loan repayments on Aug. 29, 2023."
The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 314 to
117, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate passed the bill,
sent it to President Biden, and it was signed into law. \[House Vote

-   **The Packaged Codified Ending The Pause On Loan Payments First
    Paused By President Trump At The Beginning Of The COVID-19
    Pandemic.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans had
    sought to block the student loan forgiveness in negotiations over
    raising the debt ceiling, but the agreement (HR 3746) the House
    passed on Wednesday did not deal with it. It did, however, codify
    ending a pause on loan payments first instituted by President Donald
    Trump at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The
    bipartisan agreement bars Biden from issuing another extension of
    the current pause, which is set to end by Sept. 1." \[Congressional

    Previously.** According to CNN, "Under the package, borrowers will
    have to begin paying back their student loans at the end of the
    summer, as the Biden administration has already announced, according
    to a source familiar. The pause has been in effect since the
    Covid-19 pandemic began." \[CNN,

### Separating Joint Student Loans

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Allow Federal Student Loan Borrowers Who
Received A Joint Consolidation Loan As Married Couples To Jointly Apply
For Each Borrower To Receive A Separate Federal Loan.** In September
2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the
Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act, which would "permit married or
formerly married federal student loan borrowers who received a joint
consolidation loan as a married couple to jointly apply to the Education
Department for each individual to receive a separate federal loan,
including if the original loan is in default. The separate loans would
be split proportionally based on the percentage of the joint loan
attributable to each borrower, or according to the provisions of a
divorce agreement." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill
by a vote of 232-193, thus the bill was sent to President Biden and it
ultimately became law. \[House Vote 448,

    Fiscal Interest Of The Government.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "It would permit borrowers to apply individually if they
    experienced domestic violence or economic abuse from the other
    borrower; are unable to reasonably reach or access the loan
    information of the other borrower; or if the department determines
    that authorizing the individual application would be in the best

    "The bill in question, the Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act,
    which President Biden is expected to sign this week, closes a
    loophole created in the 1990s, when Congress began allowing married
    couples to consolidate their student loans for a lower interest
    rate. It seemed like a good idea back then -- a way for couples to
    save money on their loans and have a single monthly payment.
    Congress shuttered the program in 2006, but never passed a way to
    separate the loans" \[NPR,

    "Sixteen years later, about 14,000 borrowers are still shackled to
    each other -- even after divorce, an NPR investigation found. In
    some cases, borrowers are being held responsible for debt that was

    Individually.** According to NPR, "Borrowers must apply through the
    U.S. Education Department, which will ask both parties attached to
    the loan to sign a form separating the debts. However, if a borrower
    can show they experienced domestic violence or economic abuse from
    their former partner, or they are unable to reach their former
    partner, they can initiate the separation by themselves." \[NPR,

    part of the federal government's Public Service Loan Forgiveness
    (PSLF) program." \[NPR,

### Student Loan Forgiveness

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted To Override President Biden's Veto And
Disapprove The Biden Administration's Student Loan Forgiveness Rule,
Which Sought To Forgive Up To \$10K In Federal Student Debt And \$20K
For Pell Grant Recipients.** In June 2023, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted to override President Biden's veto on a
resolution that would "provide for congressional disapproval of an
October 2022 Education Department rule that allows for loan forgiveness
of up to \$10,000 in loan debt for federal student loan borrowers and
another \$10,000 for such borrowers who also received a Pell Grant. The
rule limits eligibility for such loan forgiveness to borrowers with a
maximum adjusted gross income of \$125,000, or \$250,000 for joint
filers. The rule also extended, through the end of 2022, the suspension
of student loan payments, the cessation of interest accrual and the
suspension of involuntary loan collections. It allowed suspended loan
payments during that period to count towards loan forgiveness or loan
rehabilitation programs. The rule took effect on Oct. 12, 2022, but its
loan forgiveness provisions have not been implemented pending legal
challenges. Under the provisions of the joint resolution, the Education
Department rule would have no force or effect, canceling the loan
forgiveness program and reinstating loan payments and interest accrual
that was suspended under the rule." The vote was on a veto override. The
House failed to acquire a 2/3 majority and rejected the motion by a vote
of 221 to 206, thus the veto was sustained. \[House Vote 277,

    would affect millions of borrowers. In the 6-3 opinion split along
    ideological lines, the conservative justices in the majority found
    the forgiveness program overstepped the bounds of federal law and
    usurped the power of Congress to control government spending."

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted To Disapprove The Biden Administration's
Student Loan Forgiveness Rule, Which Sought To Forgive Up To \$10K In
Federal Student Debt And \$20K For Pell Grant Recipients.** In May 2023,
according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for a resolution
that would "provide for congressional disapproval of an October 2022
Education Department rule that allows for loan forgiveness of up to
\$10,000 in loan debt for federal student loan borrowers and another
\$10,000 for such borrowers who also received a Pell Grant. The rule
limits eligibility for such loan forgiveness to borrowers with a maximum
adjusted gross income of \$125,000, or \$250,000 for joint filers. The
rule also extended, through the end of 2022, the suspension of student
loan payments, the cessation of interest accrual and the suspension of
involuntary loan collections. It allowed suspended loan payments during
that period to count towards loan forgiveness or loan rehabilitation
programs. The rule took effect on Oct. 12, 2022, but its loan
forgiveness provisions have not been implemented pending legal
challenges. Under the provisions of the joint resolution, the Education
Department rule would have no force or effect, canceling the loan
forgiveness program and reinstating loan payments and interest accrual
that was suspended under the rule." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the resolution by a vote of 218 to 203, thus the resolution was
sent to the Senate. The Senate passed the resolution and sent it to the
President. President Biden vetoed the resolution. \[House Vote 234,

    program in August, fulfilling a campaign promise and winning

### Student Loan Interest Deduction

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The House GOP's 2017 Tax Reform Plan Which
Significantly Cut Taxes For The Rich And Corporations And Repealed The
Tax Deduction For Student Loan Interest.** In November 2017, Fitzpatrick
voted for reconciliation legislation which significantly altered the
federal tax code. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill
substantially restructures the U.S. tax code to simplify the code and
reduce taxes on individuals, corporations and small businesses. For
individuals, it consolidates the current seven tax brackets down to four
and eliminates or restricts many tax credits and deductions, including
by eliminating the deduction for state and local income taxes and
limiting the deduction for property taxes to \$10,000 and the interest
deduction for a home mortgage to the first \$500,000 worth of a loan.
\[...\] On the business side, it reduces the corporate tax from 35% to
20% and establishes a 'territorial' tax system that would exempt most
income derived overseas from U.S. corporate taxation. It allows
businesses to immediately expense 100% of the cost of assets acquired
and placed into service, and for small businesses it raises the Section
179 expensing limit to \$5 million for five years. It also establishes a
25% rate for a portion of pass-through business income that would
otherwise have to be paid at the ordinary individual tax level, and for
small businesses where an individual would receive less than \$150,000
in pass-through income it taxes the first \$75,000 of that income at a
9% rate." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote
of 227 to 205. President Trump later signed an amended version of the
bill into law. \[House Vote 637,

-   **Legislation Repealed The Tax Deduction For Student Loan
    Interest.** According to the Washington Post, "At the moment, low
    and middle income Americans can deduct up to \$2,500 a year in
    student loan interest. That benefit would go away in 2018."

-   **In 2015, 12 Million People Used This 'Above The Line' Tax
    Deduction.** According to CNBC, "In 2015, more than 12 million
    borrowers included a student loan interest deduction on their Form
    1040, according to IRS records. Those taxpayers represent nearly 3
    in 10 of the estimated 44 million Americans with student loan debt.
    Under current rules, borrowers can deduct up to \$2,500 in interest
    paid toward qualifying federal and private student loans. (See
    infographic below for some of the ins and outs.) It\'s an
    'above-the-line' deduction on your Form 1040, meaning it directly
    reduces your taxable income --- and you don\'t need to itemize to
    claim it." \[CNBC,
