### Firefighter PFAS Guidance

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require The Homeland Security Department,
U.S. Fire Administration, EPA And NIOSH To Develop Guidance For
Firefighters And First Responders On Training, Education Programs And
Best Practices For Handling Equipment That Contains PFAS.** In December
2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the
Protecting Firefighters from Adverse Substances Act, which would
"require the Homeland Security Department, in consultation with the U.S.
Fire Administration, EPA and National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health, to develop and publish guidance for firefighters and other
emergency response personnel on training, education programs and best
practices for handling equipment containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl
substances." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 400-22, thus the bill was sent to President Biden and it
ultimately became law. \[House Vote 498,
