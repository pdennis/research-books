Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Chai Suthammanont
Remembrance Act of 2022, which would "require each federal agency,
within 60 days of enactment, to publish on its website and communicate
to employees a workplace safety plan that details health and safety
procedures during a public health emergency related to an infectious
disease for any operational worksites, including plans for providing
personal protective equipment; employee testing; cleaning protocols; any
options for remote work; requirements for public entry to facilities;
and whistleblower protocols for employees to report agency
noncompliance. It would also require the inspector general of each
agency to submit to Congress, within six months of enactment, a review
on agency compliance with the bill\'s requirements and require the
Government Accountability Office to report to Congress, within one year
of enactment, on lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic to further
improve agency health and safety policies during public health
emergencies." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 351-73. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill.
