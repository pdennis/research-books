### Pandemic Prevention And Response Agreements

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require World Health Organization (WHO)
Pandemic Prevention And Response Agreements To Be Approved By The Senate
Prior To Implementation And To Express The Sense That Many Americans Are
Skeptical Of The WHO.** In September 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for ,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would
require any World Health Assembly pandemic prevention and response
agreement reached by the International Negotiating Body established by
the second special session of the assembly be deemed a treaty and
submitted to the Senate for approval before it can be enacted and
implemented in the United States. The bill also would express the sense
of Congress that a significant segment of the U.S. public is skeptical
of the World Health Organization and the influence that China has over
it. As amended, the bill would specify that it is U.S. policy to support
Taiwan\'s full participation in the World Health Organization. It would
also specify that an international agreement deemed a treaty by the bill
would not have force of law in the U.S. before the date it was ratified
by the Senate." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 219 to 199. \[House Vote 411,

-   **Republicans Opposed Such An Agreement, Arguing That It Would
    Infringe Taxpayers' Rights And Would Result In Taxpayer Money Going
    To Abortion.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans
    argue that the U.S. should not be a part of the global accord and
    that the international health group is infringing on the rights of
    American taxpayers. Conservatives also worry the agreement will
    result in U.S. taxpayer dollars going toward abortion and caution
    that entering such accords could threaten U.S. intellectual property
    rights." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Supporters Of The Accord, Including The Biden Administration,
    Argued That Collaboration With Other WHO Members Was Necessary To
    Combat Pandemics And That Sovereignty Would Not Be Impacted.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Proponents of the pandemic
    accord argue that working with other WHO member countries to prepare
    for the next pandemic is essential. The Biden administration opposed
    the legislation and said the bill would improperly constrain the
    president's authority to work with the international community
    during global public health emergencies. 'False claims that the
    treaty would undermine our sovereignty have been undermined by
    multiple reputable sources,' Foreign Affairs ranking member
    Gregory W. Meeks, D-N.Y., said on the House floor on Wednesday."
