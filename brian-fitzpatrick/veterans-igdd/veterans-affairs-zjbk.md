### Educational Benefits Restoration

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Restore Veteran Educational Benefits In
Cases Of Educational Institutions Engaging In Fraud.** In April 2024,
Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill,
as amended, that would permit the Veterans Affairs Department to restore
veteran educational benefits for certain assistance programs to eligible
students in cases where an educational institution is determined to have
engaged in specified fraudulent behaviors, resulting in the suspension
or termination of a program of study and preventing the student from
completing the course or program. It would require the offending
institutions to repay veteran educational benefits to the VA that were
obtained through their fraudulent behavior. It would require the VA to
disapprove such an educational institution from VA education benefit
eligibility until repayment is made. It would require the VA to
establish a process for determining repayment amounts, which must

borrowers for its housing loan guarantees." The vote was on passage. The
