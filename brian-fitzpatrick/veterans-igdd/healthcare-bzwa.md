### Automatic Enrollment

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition
Act, Which Would Automatically Enroll Eligible Veterans For VA Health
Care Services.** In January 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted for the Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition Act which
would "require the Veterans Affairs Department to automatically enroll
eligible veterans in the department\'s patient enrollment system, giving
them access to VA health care services, within 60 days of receiving
confirmation of their eligibility from the Defense Department. It would
also require the VA to provide veterans a notification of enrollment, an
electronic version of their certificate of eligibility, means to opt out
of enrollment electronically and instructions to elect enrollment at a
later date." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 265-163. \[House Vote 14,

-   **The Bill Would Automatically Enroll Discharged Military Members
    Into The Veterans Affairs Medical System To Ease Their Access To
    Health Care And Decrease The Confusion Associated To The Health
    System.** According to the Military Times, "House lawmakers on
    Thursday advanced legislation that would automatically enroll
    separating service members into the Veterans Affairs medical system,
    an effort to streamline their access to that care if they need it.
    The move has for years been championed by advocates as a potential
    way to increase veterans' use of VA care and reduce some of the
    confusion connected to the massive health system. Past research has
    shown that veterans enrolled in VA medical care are less likely to
    die by suicide than their peers outside of the system." \[Military

-   **The Bill Would Affect Approximately 60K Veterans Per Year, And
    Instead Of Having Them Apply For VA Health Care Services, The VA
    Would Automatically Enroll Them Contingent On Eligibility.**
    According to the Military Times, "The measure would affect about
    60,000 individuals a year. Instead of formally applying for VA
    medical services, department officials would automatically add them
    to the system if they met the requirements for eligibility."

-   **According To The Congressional Budget Office, The Bill Would Cost
    Approximately \$3.1 Billion Over The Next Five Years And Individual
    Veterans Would Save An Average Of \$3,900 In Health Care Expenses.**
    According to the Military Times, "The Congressional Budget Office
    estimates the measure would cost about \$3.1 billion over the next
    five years, with individual veterans saving an average of about
    \$3,900 in health care costs." \[Military Times,

-   **Several House Republicans Argued The Costs And Impacts Of The Bill
    Were Not Fully Addressed And Warned The Bill Was A "Federal
    Overreach."** According to the Military Times, "The measure received
    opposition from some House Republicans who said the costs and impact
    of the changes have not yet been fully addressed and who complained
    that the moves amount to federal overreach." \[Military Times,

### Benefits Expansion

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Expand Health Care Benefits For Veterans.**
In November 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional
Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would expand existing health care
services and benefits for veterans and their families. The bill would
include expanding access to home and community-based services at
Department of Veterans Affairs' medical centers, expanding in-home
health care for aging veterans and increasing assistance for homeless
veterans. The bill would require the VA to provide certain home and
community-based services like Veteran Directed Care to eligible veterans
and caregivers at their local VA medical centers. It would require those
centers to be staffed to maximize effectiveness. It would increase, from
65 percent to 100 percent of nursing home costs, the cap for in-home
care programs. The bill would require more public outreach and public
notification to veterans about community care options. It would define
community care options as private-sector medical appointments paid by
the VA in circumstances where wait times in the system reach certain
benchmarks. Among other provisions, it would limit when the VA would be
allowed to restrict community care and would require VA personnel to
inform veterans about the option to receive community care when
receiving information about their benefits. It would offset the cost of
the expanded benefits by extending from Nov. 29, 2031 to June 9, 2034,
the period for certain VA housing loan fees." The vote was on passage.

Levels, Including \$70.3 Billion For Health Care Programs At The

the FY 2018 Omnibus spending bill. According to Congressional Quarterly,
"Combined, the spending measures would provide about \$1.3 trillion in
discretionary spending, with \$1.2 trillion subject to discretionary
spending caps, and \$78.1 billion designated as Overseas Contingency
Operations funds. The measure\'s spending levels are consistent with the
increased defense and non-defense budget caps set by the two-year budget
deal agreed to last month. That agreement increased the FY 2018 defense
cap by \$80 billion and the non-defense cap by \$63 billion. Given that
the previous caps were set to reduce overall discretionary spending by
\$5 billion, the net increase provided by the omnibus is \$138 billion
over the FY 2017 level." The vote was on the motion to concur in the
Senate Amendment with an Amendment. The House agreed to the motion,
thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 256 to 167. The Senate later

    including \$63.4 billion in advance FY 2018 appropriations from
    prior years and \$3.9 billion in regular appropriations. That FY
    2018 total for VHA is \$5.0 billion more than comparable FY 2017

establish regulations allowing non-VA care to exceed 100 percent of such

caregivers who are transitioned into such programs. It would require the

in-home care to veterans, including a requirement for the VA to submit

services. It also would require the VA to develop, maintain and
