    statement from the current male-only focus to be more welcoming to
    women veterans, officials announced Thursday. The current motto ---
    in use by VA and the Veterans Administration since 1959 --- is based
    on an excerpt from President Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural
    address: 'To fulfill President Lincoln's promise 'to care for him
    who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan'
    by serving and honoring the men and women who are America's
    veterans.' It's displayed prominently at about half of all VA
    hospitals, cemeteries and office buildings across the country. The
    new motto will still be based on Lincoln's words but instead reads:
    'To fulfill President Lincoln's promise to care for those who have
    served in our nation's military and for their families, caregivers,
    and survivors.'" \[Military Times,
