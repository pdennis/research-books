### Chained CPI

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Switching To The Chained-CPI
For Social Security.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a
budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal
2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by
\$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending
at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas
Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and
would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense
account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and
would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into
a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs,
such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was
an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC
budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555,

-   **Budget Recommend That Social Security Switch To The So-Called
    'Chained-CPI' To Measure Cost Of Living Adjustments** According to
    the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "To ensure that the
    purchasing power of benefits stays constant each year, the Social
    Security cost of living adjustment (COLA) increases the dollar
    amount of benefits by a formula tied to inflation. The formula uses
    an old index, the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and
    Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which overstates the true effects of
    inflation according to economists and the CBO.238 This outdated
    formula contributes to the current program's impending bankruptcy.
    This budget recommends switching to a more accurate index for all
    government programs called chained CPI-U, which economists across
    the political spectrum agree tracks the effects of inflation and
    consumer choice more accurately." \[Republican Study Committee,

-   **Resolution Called For Raising The Social Security Normal
    Retirement Age To 69.** According to the Republican Study Committee
    FY 2018 Budget, "The bipartisan Social Security Amendments of 1983
    phases in an increase in the Social Security full retirement age
    over time, beginning at 65 and reaching 67 by 2022 for those born in
    1960 and later. The Social Security Reform Act would continue this
    gradual increase of the normal retirement age at a rate of three
    months per year until it reaches 69 for those reaching age 62
    in 2030. The proposal would maintain the early retirement age at 62
    to protect those who may need to choose to begin drawing down
    benefits prior to reaching the full retirement age." \[Republican
