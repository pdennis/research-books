### Eligibility Age

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Raising The Medicare
Eligibility Age.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a budget
resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It
would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1
trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at
\$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas
Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and
would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense
account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and
would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into
a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs,
such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was
an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC
budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555,

-   **Resolution Called For Raising The Medicare Eligibility Age.**
    According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "To
    address the increased demands on Medicare, this budget proposes
    increasing the age of Medicare so that it is aligned with the normal
    retirement age for Social Security and will ensure Medicare remains
    available for future generations." \[Republican Study Committee,

### Funding

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The GOP FY 2018 Budget Resolution,
Which Started The Process Towards Tax Reform And Called For Cutting
Medicare By \$473 Billion.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against
a budget resolution that would have, according to The Hill, "The
spending blueprint is key to Republicans' efforts to pass tax reform
because it includes instructions that will allow the plan to avoid a
Democratic filibuster. \[...\] The budget, meant to outline spending for
the fiscal year, was widely viewed as a mere vehicle for passing tax
reform. \[...\] The budget would allow the Senate GOP's tax plan to add
up to \$1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade, a proposal that has
raised concerns with fiscal hawks in the GOP. Its instructions call for
the Senate Finance Committee to report a tax bill by Nov. 13. Still, the
document outlines the Senate GOP's political vision. It maintains
spending at 2017 levels for the year, but would then cut nondefense
spending in subsequent years, leading to a \$106 billion cut in 2027. It
would also allow defense levels to continue rising at their current
rates, reaching \$684 billion at the end of a decade. The resolution
also proposes \$473 billion in cuts to Medicare's baseline spending over
a decade and about \$1 trillion from Medicaid, though those provisions
are not enforceable without additional legislation." The vote was on a
motion to concur in the Senate amendment. The House agreed to the
motion, thereby agreeing to the budget by a vote of 216 to 212. \[House

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The House GOP FY 2018 Budget
Resolution, Which Started The Process Towards Tax Reform And Called For
\$1.5 Trillion In Health Care Programmatic Cuts, Including Medicare.**
In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against the House GOP FY 2018 budget
resolution. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Adoption of the
concurrent resolution that would provide for \$3.2 trillion in new
budget authority in fiscal 2018, not including off-budget accounts. It
would assume \$1.22 trillion in discretionary spending in fiscal 2018.
It would assume the repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul law. It also
would propose reducing spending on mandatory programs such as Medicare
and Medicaid and changing programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (also known as food stamps). It would call for
restructuring Medicare into a 'premium support' system beginning in
2024. I would also require the House Ways and Means Committee to report
out legislation under the budget reconciliation process that would
provide for a revenue-neutral, comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. tax
code and would include instructions to 11 House committees to trigger
the budget reconciliation process to cut mandatory spending. The
concurrent resolution would assume that, over 10 years, base
(non-Overseas Contingency Operations) discretionary defense spending
would be increased by a total of \$929 billion over the Budget Control
Act caps and non-defense spending be reduced by \$1.3 trillion." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the budget resolution by a vote of
219 to 206. A modified version was later agreed to by both the House and
the Senate. \[House Vote 557,

-   **Legislation Called For \$487 Billion In Medicare.** According to
    The Congressional Quarterly, "Under the budget, assumed spending
    (outlay) savings include \$1.5 trillion from Medicaid and other
    health programs (including by enacting the House-passed bill from
    earlier this year to repeal and replace the 2010 health care law),
    \$487 billion from Medicare, and \$2.4 billion from other mandatory
    spending programs. It also assumes \$541 billion in savings from
    reduced interest on the national debt." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Budget Called For Ending Medicare As We Know It And Replaced With
    It Voucher Assistance.** According to the Republican Study Committee
    FY 2018 Budget, "Beginning in 2022, this budget transforms Medicare
    into a health insurance program similar to both the system that
    federal employees enjoy and to the current Medicare Part D. The
    improved program would allow participants to choose among Medicare
    plans offered on a regulated exchange. Enrollees in Medicare would
    receive assistance from the Federal Government to offset the cost of
    their health insurance policies. Seniors can direct this payment to
    the Medicare plan of their choice offered on a regulated exchange,
    including both private plans and traditional fee-for-service
    Medicare. To guarantee that health insurance remains accessible and
    affordable, the government's financial assistance would be adjusted
    for the beneficiary's current state of health, the cost of medical
    care in the area where they live, and the individual's wealth and
    income. In addition, under this plan, Medicare beneficiaries would
    receive certain new consumer protections, including protection
    against catastrophic health care costs." \[Republican Study
