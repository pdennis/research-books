### Remote Voting

**2020: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Allowing Members Of Congress To Vote
Remotely During The COVID-19 Pandemic.** In May 2020, Fitzpatrick voted
against a remote voting bill that would, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "establish procedures authorizing remote voting by proxy for
House members and remote committee proceedings during the COVID-19
public health emergency. It would allow members of the House to serve as
a proxy for up to ten members for any given vote. It would require
members to designate such proxies through a letter submitted to the
clerk and provide proxies with exact instructions with respect to each
vote. It would require that any member whose vote is cast or whose
presence is recorded by proxy count toward a quorum, and it would
require the clerk to make available a full list of proxy designations
during any vote. It would authorize House committees to conduct
official, public proceedings remotely and authorize committee members to
participate remotely during in-person committee proceedings, including
voting and being counted toward a quorum. It would authorize witnesses
to appear and committees to issue subpoenas for witnesses to appear at
remote hearings and depositions." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 217-189. \[House Vote 107,

-   **The Bill Allowed House Members To Vote By Proxy For 45 Days And
    Hold Remote Committee Meetings.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The coronavirus pandemic has prompted the House to allow
    lawmakers to vote by proxy, without physical presence at the
    Capitol. The significant, yet temporary, change to operations was
    not enacted during any other national crisis in history. The House
    voted 217-189 Friday to approve a package of historic changes to the
    chamber rules to allow Congress to continue much of its business
    through the pandemic that has made gathering together and travel
    threats to public health \[...\] Under the new rules, lawmakers will
    be able to join millions of Americans in working from home if they
    are unable to travel to Capitol Hill to participate in House
    business \[...\] Proxy voting and remote committee business would
    only be allowed for a 45 day period, but it could be renewed. The
    authority to enact a period of proxy voting ends at the close of the
    116th Congress." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Congressional Quarterly: Republicans Opposed The Bill, Stating
    Concerns That The New Rule Is Unprecedented And Would "Erode The
    Institution" Of Congress.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Debate over the changes has been fiery, as Republicans want to
    follow the lead of the president and GOP-led Senate and resume
    regular business. Democrats say that short term reliance on
    technology will provide a safe way to work as the pandemic drags on.
    But Republicans objected to what they called a power grab by the
    Democratic majority during the crisis \[...\] Republicans \[are
    concerned\] that remote governing would set a precedent that they
    said would erode the institution" \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/15/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5908904?12)\]

-   **Other Congressional Scholars Held Concerns That The New
    Proceedings Could Change Take Away From The In-Person Deal Making
    That Is Central To Congress.** According to the New York Times, "But
    beyond the partisan considerations, a broad cross-section of
    congressional scholars, parliamentary experts and former officials
    warn that the decision could have unintended and long-lasting
    consequences, altering the course of the body in fundamental ways
    that few rules changes in the last two centuries have \[...\] The
    more nagging questions, even to those who support the changes, have
    to do with what happens next. What will become of the in-person,
    back slapping, ear-whispering, wheeling and dealing that powers the
    Congress? \[New York Times,
