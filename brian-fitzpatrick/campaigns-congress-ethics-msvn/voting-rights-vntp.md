### Access To Voting

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Prohibiting Funding For An Executive
Action Promoting Access To Voting.** In June 2024, Fitzpatrick voted
against , according to Congressional Quarterly, "amendment no. 43 that
would prohibit the use of funds in the bill from being used to carry out
various sections of Executive Order 14019 regarding promoting access to
voting." The vote was on the amendment. The underlying legislation was
the FY 2025 Defense Appropriations. The House adopted the amendment by a
vote of 201 to 187. \[House Vote 327,

-   **The Executive Order Was Issued Three Years Ago And Encouraged
    Federal Agencies To Promote Voter Registration.** According to NPR,
    "In these final months before this fall's election, Republican
    officials are ramping up attacks on a three-year-old executive order
    President Biden issued to try to get more eligible voters signed up
    to cast ballots. The order calls for federal agencies to promote
    voter registration and participation in ways that are 'consistent
    with applicable law.' Many election experts see the effort as a
    worthwhile attempt to take advantage of the regular interactions
    eligible voters have with the government and address long-standing
    barriers to the ballot, including those facing people of color,
    those with disabilities, those in federal custody and those serving
    overseas in the U.S. military. \[NPR,

-   **The Executive Order Stemmed From The National Voter Registration
    Act Which Required States To Designate Military Recruitment Offices
    As Voter Registration Agencies And Allowed Other Offices To Receive
    The Same Designation.** Under the National Voter Registration Act,
    states must designate U.S. military recruitment offices in their
    state as official voter registration agencies, which are required to
    distribute registration forms, help people fill them out and hand
    off completed forms to state election officials --- all with
    restrictions on any partisan activity. States can also partner with
    other local offices of the federal government to designate them as
    voter registration agencies. 'But there was no real fire under them
    to do that,' Tokaji explains. Since Biden's order, Kentucky and
    Michigan have announced voter registration designations for Veterans
    Affairs facilities in their states, and the White House has touted
    designations for a tribal university in Kansas and a tribal college
    in New Mexico operated by the Department of the Interior's Bureau of
    Indian Education. Michigan has also said it's made an agreement to
    send state election officials to register eligible voters at local
    outreach events organized by the U.S. Small Business
    Administration." \[NPR,

-   **The Executive Order Required Agencies To Submit Strategic Plans To
    Increase Voter Registration, Which Republicans Attacked For Lacking
    Transparency Despite Many Plans Being Made Public Following Freedom
    Of Information Act Requests.** According to NPR, "Partisan fights
    over voting policy have intensified since former President Donald
    Trump's administration, and Biden's order has become the latest
    target for Republican critics. The order directed federal agencies
    to submit to the White House strategic plans on how they can promote
    voter registration and participation. While some of those plans were
    made public after Freedom of Information Act requests by right-wing
    activist groups, many GOP officials have slammed the administration
    for a lack of transparency." \[NPR,

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Prohibiting Funding For An Executive
Action Promoting Access To Voting.** In June 2024, Fitzpatrick voted
against , according to Congressional Quarterly, "amendment no. 63 that
would prohibit the use of funds provided by the bill to implement a
March 2021 executive order directing federal agencies to promote access
to voting and voting rights." The vote was on the amendment. The
underlying legislation was the FY 2025 State-Foreign Operations
Appropriations. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 208 to 202.

### Allowing Incarcerated Felons To Vote

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against An Amendment That Would Allow
Incarcerated Felons To Vote During Elections.** In March 2021,
Fitzpatrick voted against an amendment to the For The People Act which
would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "strike language that would
allow the denial of voting rights to individuals serving felony
sentences in correctional institutions at the time of an election." The
vote was on adoption of an amendment. The House rejected the amendment
by a vote of 97-328. \[House Vote 53,

### Anti-Voter Suppression Enforcement

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Strengthening Anti-Voter Suppression
Enforcement Authorities, Which Would Restore Preclearance Requirements
Under The Voting Rights Act For Voting Practices In States And
Localities With A History Of Voter Suppression.** In August 2021,
Fitzpatrick voted against the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement
Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"strengthen anti-discrimination enforcement authorities in relation to
voting practices. The bill would effectively restore preclearance
requirements under the Voting Rights Act for any changes to voting
practices in states and localities with a history of voting rights
violations within the previous 25 years." The vote was on passage. The
House passed the bill by a vote of 219-212. The Senate did not take
substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 260,

-   **Under The Measure, States And Localities With 15 Or More Voting
    Rights Violations Within The Past 15 Years Would Need To Undergo
    Federal Preclearance Before Implementing Any Changes To Voting
    Laws.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House-passed bill
    says states and localities that had 15 or more violations in the
    past 25 years would need preclearance from Washington before any
    changes to voting laws they enact would take effect."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [8/31/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6331288?3)\]

-   **The Bill Would Have Directed The Justice Department To Assign
    "Federal Election Observers," Who Would Ensure States Comply With
    Federal Voting Rights Guidelines.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "expand Justice Department authority to assign federal
    election observers to ensure compliance with federal voting rights
    protections, including bilingual election requirements."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [8/24/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/260?14)\]

-   **The Bill Would Have Required Localities And States To Provide
    Notice Of Any Voting Procedure Change, Provided Updated Demographic
    Data Within 10 Days Of Restricting Changes, And Provided Grants To
    Small Jurisdictions To Help Them Comply With Notice Requirements.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "require states and localities
    to provide public notice of any changes to voting procedures made
    within 180 days of a federal election and to provide public notice
    of updated demographic data within ten days of any change to
    electoral district boundaries. It would require the department to
    make grants to small jurisdictions with a population of 10,000 or
    less to help them comply with public notice requirements related to
    voting practices." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [8/24/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/260?14)\]

-   **The Bill Would Have Codified Various Requirements For "Vote
    Denial" And "Vote Dilution" Claims And Other Voter Suppression
    Claims For Court Evaluations.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "codify or expand various requirements for court
    evaluation of 'vote denial' and 'vote dilution' discrimination
    claims and other voting rights violations, including to provide for
    violations in the case of voting practices that have the purpose or
    will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on
    account of race or color, including rules that have not yet been
    implemented." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [8/24/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/260?14)\]

-   **After The Supreme Court Ruling In Brnovich v. DNC, Which "Made It
    More Difficult To Challenge Voting Laws On The Grounds Of
    Discrimination," The Measure Could Facilitate Bringing And Possibly
    Winning Lawsuits For Plaintiffs Under Section 2 Of The Voting Rights
    Act.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "the measure could make
    it easier for plaintiffs to bring, and possibly win, suits. That's
    because the bill responded to another Supreme Court case this year,
    Brnovich v. DNC, that made it more difficult to challenge voting
    laws on the grounds of discrimination. That decision, which was
    aimed at Section 2 of the original Voting Rights Act, made it harder
    for an election change that causes a disproportionate impact to
    minority communities to be considered a violation of the law."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [8/31/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6331288?3)\]

### Ballot Drop Boxes

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against An Amendment That Would Ensure
Counties With Over 20,000 Registered Voters Offer At Least One Ballot
Drop Box For 24 Hours A Day.** In March 2021, Fitzpatrick voted against
en block amendments no. 1 to the For The People Act which would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "require states to ensure that in
counties with at least 20,000 registered voters at least one drop box is
open to accept ballots for 24 hours a day." The vote was on adoption of
amendments. The House adopted the amendments by a vote of 218-210.

### Barring Voter Roll Purging

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Restricting So-Called "Voter Purges"
Such As By Stopping States From Removing People From The Voter Rolls If
They Failed To Vote In An Election As Part Of A Larger Anti-Corruption
And Democracy Reform Bill.** In March 2019, Fitzpatrick voted against
The 'For The People Act.' According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
measure restricts the ability of states to 'purge' voter rolls,
including by prohibiting states from removing an individual's
registration because they failed to vote in an election or from
'systematically' removing individuals from their voter rolls using
information obtained by cross-checking individuals who may have moved
out of state, unless certain safeguards are followed." The overall was,
also according to CBS News, "the most sweeping anti-corruption measure
passed by the House of Representatives in a generation, by a vote of 234
to 193. The bill focuses on voting rights, campaign finance, and
government ethics." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill
by a vote of 234 to 193. \[House Vote 118,

### Early Voting

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Requiring Early Voting And Allow No
Reason Absentee Ballot As Part Of A Larger Anti-Corruption And Democracy
Reform Bill.** In March 2019, Fitzpatrick voted against The 'For The
People Act.' According to Congressional Quarterly, "It requires that all
states allow early voting for federal elections, under which individuals
could vote at least 15 days prior to election day at accessible early
voting stations, and it establishes a national standard under which any
individual, for any reason, may use an absentee ballot and vote by mail.
It requires states to automatically register eligible voters, including
when individuals turn 18 and become eligible to vote, and requires
states to accept online registration applications and allow individuals
to update their voter registration information online. States also must
allow for same-day voting registration." The overall was, also according
to CBS News, "the most sweeping anti-corruption measure passed by the
House of Representatives in a generation, by a vote of 234 to 193. The
bill focuses on voting rights, campaign finance, and government ethics."
The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 234 to
193. \[House Vote 118,

### Early Voting Poll Location

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Making Early Voting Locations Having
Uniform Hours And Be Near Public Transportation, If Possible, As Part Of
A Larger Anti-Corruption And Democracy Reform Bill.** In March 2019,
Fitzpatrick voted against The 'For The People Act.' According to
Congressional Quarterly, "Under the measure, early voting locations must
keep uniform hours and must be located near public transportation 'to
the greatest extent possible.'" The overall was, also according to CBS
News, "the most sweeping anti-corruption measure passed by the House of
Representatives in a generation, by a vote of 234 to 193. The bill
focuses on voting rights, campaign finance, and government ethics." The

### Judicial Preclearance

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Expanding Voting Rights Enforcement
Authorities, Which Would Expand The Court's Ability For Judicial
Preclearance For Voting Practice Changes In Response To Laws Prohibiting
Racial Or Language Discrimination** In August 2021, Fitzpatrick voted
against the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021 which
would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "expand certain voting
rights enforcement authorities, including to allow courts to grant
injunctions or require judicial preclearance for changes to voting
practices in response to any federal voting rights law prohibiting
racial or language discrimination." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 219-212. The Senate did not take
substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 260,

-   **The Bill Would Have Required Voting Change Practices To Be
    Submitted To The Justice Department For Preclearance Before They May
    Be Implemented, And Allowed For Exemptions If Jurisdictions Have Not
    Imposed Voter Suppression Laws In The Last Decade.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "establish formulas to identify such
    jurisdictions, which would be required to submit proposed changes to
    the Justice Department for review and approval before they may be
    implemented. It would establish an 'administrative bailout'
    provision allowing jurisdictions to apply for exemptions to
    preclearance requirements if they meet eligibility standards related
    to not implementing discriminatory practices in the previous 10
    years." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [8/24/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/260?14)\]

-   **The Bill Would Have Required States And Localities To Analyze
    Whether Their Voting Practice Changes Would Suppress The Votes Of
    Minority Communities And Submit The Changes For Federal
    Preclearance.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "require
    states and localities to review any newly enacted or adopted
    election practices to identify whether they include certain
    practices that could impact the ability to vote based on race, color
    or language minority group, such as changes to impose stricter voter
    identification requirements; changes to jurisdictional boundaries or
    voting locations in jurisdictions with large minority populations;
    and changes that prohibit the provision of food or drinks to
    individuals waiting to vote. It would require jurisdictions that
    adopt such practices to submit them for federal preclearance."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [8/24/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/260?14)\]

-   **Under The Measure, Certain Proposed Changes To Voting Law Would Be
    Subject To Federal Preclearance, Even If The Change Does Not Fall
    Within The 25-Year-Window, Including Voter Identification
    Requirements And Voter Roll Maintenance.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The bill would also subject certain
    proposed laws to preclearance, even potentially in jurisdictions
    that would not otherwise fall under the 25-year lookback criteria.
    The bill's Section 6 would set out several practices, including
    changes to voter identification needed to vote and maintenance of
    voter rolls, that could be subject to preclearance." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [8/31/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6331288?3)\]

-   **Under The Measure, Federal Preclearance Would Apply To Legislation
    That Has Not Been Enacted, Which Would Attempt To Combat Many
    States' Efforts To Rescind Voting Practices Used During The
    Pandemic, Including Voting By Mail.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "Advocates say the voting rights bill named for Lewis is
    urgently needed to combat state efforts to roll back some of the
    pandemic's voting practices, such as voting by mail, as well as
    other new restrictions. But the bill, should it become law, would be
    more forward-looking. Preclearance would apply to not-yet-enacted
    legislation and not to state laws already on the books."

    Early Voting And Expanding Vote By Mail Led To Fraud In The 2020
    General Elections.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "It also

### Proof Of Citizenship

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require Proof Of Citizenship To Register To

Rolls.** In July 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to
Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would modify the 1993 National
Voter Registration Act to require individuals to provide proof of U.S.
citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections. The bill also
would require states to remove non-citizens from state voting rolls and

    Elections.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Introduced by
    Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, HR 8281 would require voters to prove
    citizenship to register, with the aim of keeping noncitizens from
    voting in federal elections. While that is already illegal, some
    jurisdictions, including Washington, D.C., allow noncitizens to vote
    in local elections." \[Congressional Quarterly,

    Faith In Elections While Opponents Argued Americans Were Confident
    In Federal Elections Prior To Trump's False Claims About the 2020
    Election And The Bill Would Only Worsen Election Denialism.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Chairman Bryan Steil, R-Wis.,
    argued that the legislation was necessary to restore Americans'
    shaken faith in the validity of federal vote counts. 'When Americans
    are more confident that our elections are secure, they're more
    likely to participate,' he said. 'As chairman of this committee, my
    focus is on increasing confidence and participation in our
    elections.' Ranking member Joseph D. Morelle, D-N.Y., said Americans
    were confident in the security of the nation's elections until
    Republicans, led by former President Donald Trump, started making
    false claims about the 2020 election. 'Every one of my majority
    colleagues understands that this narrative will aggravate the
    perilous infection of election denialism that is spreading in the
    American civic body,' he said. Morelle said he agreed with Steil's
    avowed goal of 'increasing confidence and participation in our
    elections' but said the bills advanced Thursday didn't accomplish
    either." \[Congressional Quarterly,

    the measure, dubbed the SAVE Act, in a news conference on the
    Capitol steps two weeks ago alongside Speaker Mike Johnson and other
    House Republicans who led efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential
    election. Despite no evidence that noncitizens were voting in
    federal elections in any more than a handful of isolated incidents,
    Johnson argued it was common nonetheless. 'We all know, intuitively,
    that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections,' he said.
    'But it's not been something that is easily provable.'"

    many eligible voters, like recently married women who changed their
    names." \[Congressional Quarterly,

    effectively set a national floor on ballot access, requiring all
    federal elections to start with an identical set of rules. States
    and other federal jurisdictions could tweak them to provide more
    access, but not less. Some states like Colorado and Minnesota have
    rules that are more generous that the bill mandates; others, like
    Texas and Tennessee, make it much harder to register and vote than

### Voting Interference

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Making It A Crime For People To
Interfere With Someone Trying To Register To Vote And Spreading False
Information About Where And How To Vote As Part Of A Larger
Anti-Corruption And Democracy Reform Bill.** In March 2019, Fitzpatrick
voted against The 'For The People Act.' According to Congressional
Quarterly, "The measure makes it a crime to 'corruptly hinder, interfere
with, or prevent another person' from registering to vote or to aid
another person in interfering. If convicted, an individual could face a
fine or imprisonment for up to five years, or both. The Election
Assistance Commission must develop and publish best practice
recommendations for states to educate voters, poll workers, and election
officials about illegal interference with the registration and voting
process." The overall was, also according to CBS News, "the most
sweeping anti-corruption measure passed by the House of Representatives
in a generation, by a vote of 234 to 193. The bill focuses on voting
rights, campaign finance, and government ethics." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 234 to 193. \[House Vote

-   **The Bill Makes It A Crime For A Person To Knowingly Spread False
    Information About Where And How To Vote** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The measure makes it a crime to disseminate false
    information to voters through any means of communication within 60
    days of an election, if the individual knows it to be materially
    false and has the intent to impede or prevent another person from
    voting. Such false information may include incorrect information
    regarding polling places or qualifications to vote. Violators would
    be subject to fines of up to \$100,000 or up to five years in
    prison. If the Justice Department believes that state or local
    election officials have not taken adequate steps to promptly
    communicate accurate information to correct any materially false
    voter information, the department must communicate accurate
    information to the public. Such communications must be accurate and
    objective, provide only the information necessary to correct the
    false information, and reach those to whom the false information was
    provided." \[Congressional Quarterly,
