and corporate, from making contributions to super PACs." The overall

    corporation is also considered foreign-owned or controlled if 20% or
    more of the voting shares are owned or controlled by foreign

Make It More Effective As Part Of A Larger Anti-Corruption And Democracy
Reform Bill.** In March 2019, Fitzpatrick voted against The 'For The

    (currently no more than three may be from the same political party).
    Members would continue to be appointed by the president and

    new FEC is constituted in January 2022 two members would serve
    three-year terms so all terms don\'t expire at once)."

    written reports and answers to questions; to administer oaths or
    affirmations; to issue subpoenas; to order depositions and compel
    testimony; and to pay witnesses fees and mileage as are paid by

-   **H.R. 1 Would Establish A Nationwide Automatic Voter Registration,
    Require Paper Ballots, And Establish An Optional 6-To-1 Public
    Financing System To Fund Congressional Campaigns While Reinforcing
    Disclosure Rules For Super PACs And Interest Groups That Influence
    Elections.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill would
    create nationwide automatic voter registration and require paper
    ballots in all jurisdictions. It would set up a 6-to-1 optional
    public financing system to pay for congressional campaigns and
    tighten disclosure rules for political groups and super PACs that
    spend money to influence elections." \[Congressional Quarterly,

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Amendment That Would Bar Taxpayer Money
From Being Deposited Into The Proposed Public Finance System.** In March

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Creating A Public Financing System For
Political Campaigns That Would Provide A 6-1 Match Rate For Presidential
And Congressional Candidates Capped At \$200 As Part Of A Larger
Anti-Corruption And Democracy Reform Bill.** In March 2019, Fitzpatrick
voted against The 'For The People Act.' According to Vox, "HR 1 covers
three main planks: campaign finance reform, strengthening the
government's ethics laws, and expanding voting rights. Here's the
important part of each section, briefly explained. Campaign finance.
Establishing public financing of campaigns, powered by small donations.
Under the vision of the bill's main sponsor, Rep. John Sarbanes (D-MD),
the federal government would provide a voluntary 6-1 match for
candidates for president and Congress, which means for every dollar a
candidate raises from small donations, the federal government would
match it six times over. The maximum small donation that could be
matched would be capped at \$200. The most substantial change to HR 1 is
this program now won't be funded by taxpayer dollars as originally
planned; instead, it will come from adding a 2.75 percent fee on
criminal and civil fines, fees, penalties, or settlements with banks and
corporations that commit corporate malfeasance (think Wells Fargo).
Democrats are using this idea to push back on Republican attacks that
taxpayers shouldn't be subsidizing campaigns." The vote was on passage.
The House passed the bill by a vote of 234 to 193. \[House Vote 118,

-   **The Matching System Was Funded By A 2.75 Percent Fee On Criminal
    Fees, Penalties, Or Settlements With Banks And Corporation That
    Commit Corporate Malfeasance.** According to Vox, "The most
    substantial change to HR 1 is this program now won't be funded by

    \$1,000 Per Donor, Could Use No More Than \$50,000 From Personal And
    Funding From Immediate Family, And Would Be Prevented From
    Associating With Or Creating A PAC.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "To qualify for small dollar campaign financing, a
    candidate must first receive qualified small dollar contributions
    from at least 1,000 individuals that total at least \$50,000.
    Candidates participating could then accept campaign donations of no
    more than \$1,000 per individual donor, and could otherwise only
    receive contributions from state or national political committees
    and multi-candidate political committees, and could use no more than
    \$50,000 total in personal funds and funding from an immediate
    family member. Those candidates would also be prohibited from
    associating with, establishing, financing, maintaining or
    controlling a leadership PAC." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/5/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5476854?1)\]

### Super PACs

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Prohibiting Super PACs From Financing
Political Ads.** In March 2021, Fitzpatrick voted against the For The
People Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit
super PACs from financing political ads supporting or opposing a
political candidate and require corporations, organizations and
political committees that spend more than \$10,000 in an election cycle
to disclose their campaign-related expenditures of more than \$1,000 and
any donors contributing more than \$10,000 in that cycle." The vote was
on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 220-210. The Senate
did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 62,

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Strengthening Rules Prohibiting Super
Pac And Candidate Coordination As Part Of A Larger Anti-Corruption And
Democracy Reform Bill.** In March 2019, Fitzpatrick voted against The
'For The People Act.' According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill
"strengthens prohibitions on coordination between super PACs and
candidates for federal office by defining 'coordinated expenditures' and
'coordinated spenders' and specifying what kinds of communications
between a candidate and his or her agents and a super PAC would
constitute coordination and what would not. It also effectively
prohibits super PACs from financing political ads that support or oppose
a specific candidate by defining as a prohibited 'coordinated
communication' a communication that advocates the election of a
candidate or defeat of the candidate\'s opponent, promotes or supports
the election of a candidate, or attacks or opposes the candidate\'s
opponent." The overall was, according to CBS News, "the most sweeping
anti-corruption measure passed by the House of Representatives in a
generation, by a vote of 234 to 193. The bill focuses on voting rights,
campaign finance, and government ethics." The vote was on passage. The
House passed the bill by a vote of 234 to 193. \[House Vote 118,

-   **Legislation Defined Coordination To Include Spending Money To
    Republish Campaign Material From The Candidate.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "In general, the bill modifies the
    statutory definition of a political contribution to define a
    coordinated expenditure as a payment for a covered communication
    made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the
    request or suggestion of a candidate, political party or agent of
    the candidate. A coordinated (and therefore prohibited) expenditure
    would include payment for any communication that republishes,
    disseminates or distributes, in whole or in part, any form of
    campaign material prepared by the candidate or his or her agents."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/5/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5476854?1)\]

-   **Legislation Created Penalties For Those Who Violate The
    Coordination Prohibition.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "The bill establishes penalties for anyone who knowingly and
    willfully violates the Federal Elections Campaign Act (FECA) by
    making a contribution which consists of a coordinated expenditure.
    Specifically, if the coordinated expenditure exceeds the applicable
    statutory contribution limit, the penalty would be 300% of the
    amount by which the contribution exceeded the limit. If the person
    is prohibited from making a contribution in any amount, the penalty
    is 300% of the amount of the entire coordinated expenditure."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/5/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5476854?1)\]

-   **Legislation Stated That Federal Candidates And Office Holders
    Could Not Fund Raise For Super Pacs.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The bill clarifies that, starting for elections
    occurring on or after Jan. 1, 2020, federal candidates and office
    holders are prohibited from fund-raising for political committees
    such as super PACs and 527 political organizations." \[Congressional
