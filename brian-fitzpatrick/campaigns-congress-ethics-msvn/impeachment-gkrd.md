### President Joe Biden

**2023: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted To Impeach President Joe Biden For
High Crimes And Misdemeanors.** In June 2023, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the "adoption of the rule (H Res 529)
that would re-refer the resolution (H Res 503) impeaching President Joe
Biden for high crimes and misdemeanors to the House Judiciary and
Homeland Security Committees." The vote was on the adoption of the rule.
The House adopted the rule by a vote of 219 to 208, thus the resolution

-   **With The Adoption Of The Rule, The Impeachment Resolution Was Sent
    To The Judiciary And Homeland Security Committees For Leaders To
    Decide The Fate Of The Resolution.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "In a quick meeting Wednesday night, the House Rules
    Committee approved, 9-3, a rule that would send a resolution seeking
    to impeach President Joe Biden to the House Judiciary and Homeland
    Security committees. If the rule (H Res 529) is adopted on the House
    floor, the impeachment legislation will head back to the committees
    for its leaders to decide its fate." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **The Resolution Sought To Impeach President Biden For Alleged
    Abuses Of Power In Relation To Immigration Policies At The
    U.S.-Mexico Border.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    resolution (H Res 503), authored by Colorado Republican Lauren
    Boebert, would seek to impeach Biden for 'high crimes and
    misdemeanors' as he 'abused the powers of the office' with his
    policies on immigration at the southern border." \[Congressional
    Quarterly,

-   **The Adoption Of The Rule Effectively Paused The Possibility To
    Bring A Privileged Motion To The Floor That Would Have Forced The
    Chamber To Directly Vote On Whether To Impeach President Biden.**
    According to CNN, "The House voted Thursday to pass a rule sending a
    resolution offered by Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado to
    committee, effectively pausing a move to bring a privileged motion
    to the floor that would have forced members to vote on whether to
    impeach President Joe Biden." \[CNN,

-   **The Resolution Divided House Republicans, With Several Members
    Expressing Concerns With The Push To Force A Vote On The
    Controversial Issue, And Speaker McCarthy Encouraged His GOP
    Conference To Oppose The Resolution.** According to CNN, "Boebert's
    resolution had divided House Republicans, with many members
    expressing frustration with the conservative congresswoman's push to
    force a vote on the politically contentious issue. Speaker Kevin
    McCarthy urged his GOP conference to vote against the resolution."

    Investigations Take Course And Warned That Jumping To Impeachment
    Could Risk The GOP's Slim Majority.** According to CNN, "At a
    closed-door meeting on Wednesday, McCarthy argued that Republicans
    should let committee investigations play out and warning that
    jumping to impeachment now could threaten their slim majority,
    multiple sources in the meeting told CNN." \[CNN,
