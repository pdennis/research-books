# Lobbying

### Regulations

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Regulating Lobbying Practices,
Including Requiring Lobbyists To Disclose Their Status And Client When
Interacting With Federal Officials And Prohibiting Foreign Countries To
Lobby.** In March 2021, Fitzpatrick voted against the For The People Act
which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "include several
provisions tightening regulations on lobbying, including to require
registered lobbyists to disclose their status and their client upon
contacting a federal official and to prohibit lobbying contracts on
behalf of foreign countries that have engaged." The vote was on passage.
The House passed the bill by a vote of 220-210. The Senate did not take
substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 62,

### Revolving Door

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Preventing A Person From Receiving Any
Incentive Payments For Leaving Their Company To Enter Government
Service, Against Prohibiting So Called "Golden Parachutes," And Against
Preventing Federal Government Procurement Officials From Getting Paid By
A Company For Two Years If The Company Had Received A Federal Contract
As Part Of A Larger Anti-Corruption And Democracy Reform Bill.** In
March 2019, Fitzpatrick voted against The 'For The People Act.'
According to Congressional Quarterly, "To slow the 'revolving door'
between government and the private sector, the measure prohibits an
individual who leaves a corporation to enter government service from
receiving any incentive payments from the corporation and effectively
prohibits 'golden parachutes' in the form of a bonus that some firms pay
employees upon their accepting a government job. Federal procurement
officers who were responsible for awarding contracts would be prohibited
from receiving any compensation from a company for two years after
leaving government service if the procurement officer had awarded a
contract to that company, and federal officials would be prohibited from
most dealings with their former agency for two years after they leave
government service." The overall was, also according to CBS News, "the
most sweeping anti-corruption measure passed by the House of
Representatives in a generation, by a vote of 234 to 193. The bill
focuses on voting rights, campaign finance, and government ethics." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 234 to 193.

### Shadow Lobbying

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Expanding The Definition Of A Lobbyist
To Include Those Who Direct Or Influence Lobbying Contact Or Those Who
Help Prepare Or Plan Lobbying Activities As Part Of A Larger
Anti-Corruption And Democracy Reform Bill.** In March 2019, Fitzpatrick
voted against The 'For The People Act.' According to Congressional
Quarterly, "The measure clarifies that counseling in support of lobbying
contracts is considered lobbying under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of
1995. Specifically, the bill states that 'any individual, with authority
to direct or substantially influence a lobbying contact' or who
'provides counseling services in support of preparation and planning
activities which are treated as lobbying activities' would now be
considered a lobbyist and be subject to registration requirements.
(Critics say that under current law individuals are able to avoid
registration requirements by providing 'counseling' services instead of
outright 'lobbying' activities.)" The overall was, also according to CBS
News, "the most sweeping anti-corruption measure passed by the House of
Representatives in a generation, by a vote of 234 to 193. The bill
focuses on voting rights, campaign finance, and government ethics." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 234 to 193.
