### Presidential Divesting

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Requiring The President And The Vice
To Divest Any Financial Interest That Could Create A Conflict Of
Interest And Require Presidential Appointees Recuse Themselves From
Things That Impact The President Of Their Spouse As Part Of A Larger
Anti-Corruption And Democracy Reform Bill.** In March 2019, Fitzpatrick
voted against The 'For The People Act.' According to Congressional
Quarterly, "It generally requires the president and vice president,
within 30 days of assuming office, to divest any financial interests
that create a conflict of interest by converting the interests to cash
or another investment that meets standards established by the Office of
Government Ethics, or by placing the interests in a qualified blind
trust. It requires all presidential appointees to recuse themselves from
financial matters involving the president or his or her spouse." The
overall was, also according to CBS News, "the most sweeping
anti-corruption measure passed by the House of Representatives in a
generation, by a vote of 234 to 193. The bill focuses on voting rights,
campaign finance, and government ethics." The vote was on passage. The
House passed the bill by a vote of 234 to 193. \[House Vote 118,
