# Legislative Branch Entities

### Funding

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted For The FY 2025 Legislative Branch
Appropriations That Increased Funding For Member Allowances And The
Capitol Police While Reducing Funding For The Architect Of The
Capitol.** In July 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to
Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would provide \$5.6
billion for fiscal 2025, for the House of Representatives and joint
legislative branch items including the Library of Congress, Capitol
Police, U.S. Botanic Garden and various legislative agencies. The bill
would provide \$149 million, or 2.7 percent, more than the fiscal 2024
allocation. The bill would not provide a cost-of-living adjustment for
members. It would increase the funds allocated for members' allowances
by more than \$33 million. It also would increase Capitol Police funding
by 5 percent to more than \$832 million. The bill would provide a net
total of \$754 million for the Architect of the Capitol, a 7 percent
reduction below the fiscal 2024 enacted level." The vote was on passage.
The House rejected the bill by a vote of 205 to 213. \[House Vote 352,

-   **The Bill Prohibited Funding For DEI Offices And Programs,
    Prohibited Discrimination Against Anti-LGBTQ Individuals, And
    Prohibited COVID-19 Mask Mandates.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The bill would prohibit funding for any office or
    program related to diversity, equity and inclusion. It also would
    prohibit discrimination against a person who 'speaks, or acts, in
    accordance with a sincerely held religious belief, or moral
    conviction, that marriage is, or should be recognized as, a union of
    one man and one woman.' As amended, it would prohibit the use of
    funds to enforce a COVID-19 mask mandate." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [7/11/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/352?23)\]

-   **The Bill Received Opposition For Its Blocking Of A Cost Of Living
    Adjustment For Members With Ten Republicans Voting Against It And
    Three Democrats Voting For It.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The House rejected a fiscal 2025 Legislative Branch
    spending bill Thursday, as some Republicans rebelled against a
    provision blocking a pay raise for members of Congress as well as
    the overall funding increase the measure would provide. \[...\]
    Whether lawmakers should get an annual cost-of-living adjustment
    they have been denied for more than a decade has now emerged as a
    key sticking point. The bill would block a COLA for another year.
    Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., led a charge against the bill, saying the
    measure violates the Constitution's 27th Amendment because pay
    legislation must be considered separately and not take effect until
    after an intervening election. Ten Republicans voted against the
    bill, and the GOP controls the House by only a three-vote margin.
    Three Democrats from conservative districts supported the bill.
    \[...\] Lawmakers were in line for a 3.8 percent COLA this year,
    which would have raised base pay to \$180,600, according to the
    Congressional Research Service. If members had received every COLA
    they have foregone, their 2024 salary would have been \$243,300."
