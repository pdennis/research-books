### Disapproval Of Voting Law

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted To Disapprove D.C.'s November 2022 Ordinance
That Would Allow Non-Citizens, Including Undocumented Immigrants, To
Vote In Local D.C. Elections Starting In 2024.** In February 2023,
according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for a resolution
that would "establish congressional disapproval of, effectively
repealing, the November 2022 District of Columbia Council legislation
allowing noncitizens, including undocumented immigrants, to vote in
local D.C. elections beginning in 2024." The vote was on passage. The
House passed the resolution by a vote of 260 to 162, thus the resolution
was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 118,

-   **The D.C. Ordinance Would Allow Foreign Citizens Who Live In D.C.,
    Including Undocumented Immigrants, To Vote In Location, And Mayor
    Bowser Allowed The Bill To Become Law Without Her Signature.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The other measure would allow
    foreign citizens residing in D.C., including undocumented
    immigrants, to vote in local elections. That bill passed the D.C.
    Council in October. Bowser did not act on the bill, allowing it to
    be enacted without her signature." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/9/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7661305?5)\]

-   **Republicans Claimed The D.C. Law Hindered Election Integrity And
    Aggravated Migration Challenges On The Southern Border.** According
    to Congressional Quarterly, "Congressional Republicans argued that
    legislation undermines election integrity and aggravates migration
    challenges at the U.S.-Mexico border." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/9/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7661305?5)\]

-   **Republicans Criticized The Law As Particularly Inappropriate
    Because Of The Hundreds Of Foreign Embassies In D.C.** According to
    the Associated Press, "The measure to grant noncitizens, including
    immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, the right to vote in local
    elections is not unique. Similar measures have passed in multiple
    jurisdictions around the country, including Takoma Park, Maryland
    --- a liberal bastion on the outskirts of Washington that is
    Raskin's home district. But multiple Republican critics claimed that
    the unique nature of D.C. with its hundreds of foreign embassies,
    made it particularly inappropriate." \[Associated Press,

    a total population of just under 700,000 residents." \[Associated
