### Impeachment

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Impeaching President Trump For
Incitement Of Insurrection After He Repeatedly Claimed Voter Fraud Led
To The 2020 Presidential Election Results And Made Statements At A Rally
That Encouraged The January 6th Insurrection.** In January 2021,
Fitzpatrick voted against a resolution over an article of impeachment
which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "impeach President
Donald Trump for incitement of insurrection by 'inciting violence
against the government of the United States.' Specifically, it would
state that Trump 'repeatedly issued false statements' asserting that the
results of the 2020 presidential election were the product of widespread
fraud and should not be accepted or certified. It would state that Trump
made statements at a rally on Jan. 6, 2020, that 'encouraged \-- and
foreseeably resulted in \-- lawless action' at the Capitol building
during the certification of electoral college votes, during which
protesters entered the Capitol, attacked law enforcement personnel,
'menaced' members of Congress and the vice president, and engaged in
other 'violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts.' It would state
that Trump\'s conduct on Jan. 6 followed prior efforts 'to subvert and
obstruct' the certification of 2020 presidential election results,
including during a Jan. 2 phone call during which he urged Georgia
Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to 'find' enough votes to overturn
the state\'s presidential election results and 'threatened Secretary
Raffensperger if he failed to do so.' It would state President Trump\'s
'endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of
government' and that he 'threatened the integrity of the democratic
system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled
a coordinate branch of government.' Pursuant to the rule (H Res 41),
upon adoption of the article of impeachment, the House agreed to the
resolution (H Res 40) that would appoint and authorize the following
impeachment trial managers to conduct the impeachment trial against
President Donald Trump in the Senate: Reps. Raskin, D-Md., DeGette,
D-Colo., Cicilline, D-R.I., Castro, D-Texas, Swalwell, D-Calif., Lieu,
D-Calif., Plaskett, D-V.I., Neguse, D-Colo., and Dean, D-Pa." The vote
was on agreeing to the resolution. The House passed the resolution by a
vote of 232-197, but the Senate failed to acquit former President Trump.

-   **Republicans Opposed The Second Impeachment Of President Trump Due
    To The Hurried Process, The Short Time Left Within President Trump's
    Presidency, And Concerns Of Furthering Polarization In The Country
    That Could Lead To More Violence.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "Republicans opposed to impeachment have cited a variety
    of reasons: the rushed process, the fact that Trump only has seven
    days left in office and concern that the action would only further
    divide the country and potentially lead to further violence at a
    time when it needs to unify." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Despite His Acquittal, Donald Trump Was The President To Receive
    The Most Votes For His Conviction From His Own Party.** According to
    AP News, "Though he was acquitted of the sole charge of incitement
    of insurrection, it was easily the largest number of senators to
    ever vote to find a president of their own party guilty of an
    impeachment count of high crimes and misdemeanors." \[AP News,

-   **House Prosecutors Argued That Trump Led The Capitol Attack By
    Using Harsh Rhetoric And False Claims For Months, Which Resulted In
    Five Dead People.** According to AP News, "House prosecutors have
    argued that Trump's was the 'inciter in chief' stoking a months-long
    campaign with an orchestrated pattern of violent rhetoric and false
    claims they called the 'big lie' that unleashed the mob. Five people
    died, including a rioter who was shot and a police officer." \[AP

-   **Trump's Attorneys Argued That His Comments Were Not Intended To
    Inspire Violence And That Seeking Impeachment Was A "Witch Hunt"
    Intended To Prevent Him From Running For Office In The Future.**
    According to AP News, "Trump's lawyers countered that Trump's words
    were not intended to incite the violence and that impeachment is
    nothing but a 'witch hunt' designed to prevent him from serving in
    office again." \[AP News,

**2021: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against Impeaching President Trump

Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted against the "adoption of the
rule (H Res 41) for the resolution (H Res 24) containing one article of
impeachment against President Donald Trump for incitement of
insurrection. The rule would provide for two hours of debate on the
article of impeachment without any intervening motion or question,
equally divided between the chair and ranking member of the House
Judiciary Committee or their designees. The rule would provide for
automatic agreement, upon adoption of the article of impeachment, to a
resolution (H Res 40) appointing and authorizing managers for the
impeachment trial in the Senate." The vote was on the adoption of the
rule. The House adopted the rule by a vote of 221-203. \[House Vote 16,

President Trump After Attempting To Intervene In Georgia's Vote Count
And Coerce State Officials To Declare Him Winner, Claiming The November
2020 Elections Were Fraudulent, And Inciting The January 6th

President Donald Trump is unable to successfully discharge the duties
and powers of his office, and to transmit notice to Congress that Pence
will immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as acting
president. The resolution would state among its findings that Trump
'widely advertised and broadly encouraged' participation in the march on
the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, Jan. 6, which turned into a violent
insurrectionary mob that resulted in 5 deaths following the storming of
the Capitol building; did not appeal to his followers to exit the
Capitol during the insurrection; refused to accept the results of the
2020 presidential election as legitimate; and made at least three

the state of Georgia and to 'coerce' its state officials to declare him
the winner of the state\'s electoral votes." The vote was on agreeing to
the resolution. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 223-205.

    Was Stolen" And To "Fight Like Hell" Before His Supporters Raided
    The U.S. Capitol.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    article of impeachment points to comments Trump made to his
    supporters, who gathered in Washington, D.C. on the same day
    Congress met to formally count the Electoral College votes, that the
    presidential election was stolen. He also told his supporters to
    'fight like hell' before some of them stormed the Capitol,
    interrupting the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's
    victory." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Trump Coerced Georgia's Secretary Of State To "Find" The
    Sufficient Votes To Overturn Biden's Win.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "It also cites Trump's false claims that

    call with the Georgia secretary of state during which the president
    pressured the election official to 'find' enough votes to overturn
    Biden's win in the state." \[Congressional Quarterly,

and theories regarding foreign interference in the 2016 U.S.
presidential election. It would state that Trump conditioned official
actions, including the release of security assistance funds to Ukraine,

democratic process.'" The vote was on adoption of Article I of the
