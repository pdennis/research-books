# Congressional Disapproval Process

### Disapprove Midnight Rules

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Allowing The Expedited Rules
Disapproval Process To Disapprove All Rules Issued In A President's Last
Term In One Joint Resolution.** In December 2024, Fitzpatrick voted
against , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would
allow Congress to use the expedited rules disapproval process under the
Congressional Review Act to disapprove, through a single joint
resolution of disapproval, multiple regulations issued by an
administration during the final year of a president\'s term in office.
Under current law, a separate disapproval resolution is needed for each
individual rule targeted for repeal." The House passed the bill by a
vote of 210 to 201. \[House Vote 509,
