### Independent Redistricting Commissions

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Requiring Independent Redistricting
Commissions When States Undergo The Redrawing Of Their Congressional
Maps.** In March 2021, Fitzpatrick voted against the For The People Act
which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require states to
use independent redistricting commissions when redrawing congressional
districts." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote
of 220-210. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill.

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Requiring Independent Commissions For
Redistricting Congressional Districts And That They Cannot Be Done
Mid-Decade As Part Of A Larger Anti-Corruption And Democracy Reform
Bill.** In March 2019, Fitzpatrick voted against The 'For The People
Act.' According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill requires states to
use independent redistricting commissions when redrawing congressional
districts for the U.S. House of Representatives after each decennial
U.S. census. If a commission's redistricting plan is not enacted into
law by the state, a three-judge panel would redraw the districts. The
measure prohibits the redrawing of congressional districts in
mid-decade, rather than immediately after the decennial census." The
overall was, also according to CBS News, "the most sweeping
anti-corruption measure passed by the House of Representatives in a
generation, by a vote of 234 to 193. The bill focuses on voting rights,
campaign finance, and government ethics." The vote was on passage. The
House passed the bill by a vote of 234 to 193. \[House Vote 118,
