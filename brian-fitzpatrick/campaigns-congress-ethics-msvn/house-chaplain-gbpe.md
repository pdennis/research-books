# House Chaplain

### Patrick Conroy's Dismissal

**2018: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against Investigating The
Resignation Of The Chaplain Of The House Of Representatives, Patrick J.
Conroy.** In May 2017, Fitzpatrick voted to kill a resolution that would
have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "establish\[ed\] a select
committee to investigate the resignation of Chaplain of the House of
Representatives, Patrick J. Conroy." The vote was on a motion to table
the resolution. The House tabled the motion by a vote of 223 to 182,
effectively killing the resolution. \[House Vote 172,

    Speaker Ryan "Pushed Him Out."** According to The Hill, "Conroy
    announced his retirement as chaplain earlier this month, a decision
    most members thought was voluntary until Thursday, when it emerged
    that Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) had pushed him out." \[The Hill,

-   **Democrats Claimed That Conroy May Be Have Pushed Out Due To A
    Prayer That Could Be Perceived As Critical Of The 2017 Tax Cut
    Bill.** According to The Hill, "Democrats have said that they
    believe Conroy was pushed out at least in part because of a prayer
    perceived as critical of the GOP tax law, a sentiment the former
    chaplain also echoed in an interview with The New York Times. Ryan
    told Republicans that the chaplain's exit did not have anything to
    do with the prayer." \[The Hill,

-   **Conroy Was Reinstated As House Chaplain.** According to the New
    York Times, "Speaker Paul Ryan reinstated the Rev. Patrick Conroy as
    the chaplain of the House of Representatives on Thursday, after the
    chaplain sent him a letter rescinding his forced dismissal and
    daring the speaker to fire him. 'I have accepted Father Conroy's
    letter and decided that he will remain in his position as chaplain
    of the House,' Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement. He added, 'It is
    my job as speaker to do what is best for this body, and I know that
    this body is not well served by a protracted fight over such an
    important post.' Conroy, a Jesuit priest who has been the chaplain
    since 2011, intimated in a letter to Ryan on Thursday that the
    speaker did not have the authority to fire him, noting that the
    chaplain is elected by the members of the House. He suggested his
    Roman Catholic faith had contributed to his dismissal." \[New York

**2018: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against Investigating The
Resignation Of The Chaplain Of The House Of Representatives, Patrick J.
Conroy.** In April 2017, Fitzpatrick voted to kill a resolution that
would have, according to The Hill, "set up a select committee to
investigate Patrick Conroy's dismissal as House chaplain. In a 215-171
mostly party-line vote, the House turned aside the measure from House
Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley's (N.Y.), who argued it was
necessary to look into the 'motivations and actions' behind Conroy's
dismissal." The vote was on a motion to table the resolution. The House
tabled the motion by a vote of 215 to 171, effectively killing the
resolution. \[House Vote 166,
