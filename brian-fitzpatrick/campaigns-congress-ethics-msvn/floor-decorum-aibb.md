# House Floor Decorum

### Photographs, Audio And Visual Recordings

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Allow Representatives To Be Fined For
Taking Pictures In The House Chamber As Part Of An Effort In Response To
The Democrats Protest In June 2016 Over Inaction Over Gun Safety.** In
January 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for House rules that would have,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] for members to be
fined, and their salaries docked, for violating House policies against
taking photographs in the House chamber, for making audio or visual
recordings or broadcasting such images, or for disrupting House
proceedings by taking certain actions that impair decorum on the House
floor. It also \[would have\] ma\[d\]es certain 'disorderly or
disruptive conduct' by members in the chamber subject to investigation
and possible recommendation for disciplinary action by the Ethics
Committee." The vote was on the resolution. The House passed the
resolution by a vote of 234 to 193. \[House Vote 6,

Quarterly, [1/2/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5011550?19); Congressional

5](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-resolution/5/all-actions)\]

-   **The Rule Was In Response To The Democrats Protest Over GOP
    Inaction Over Gun Safety.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "The provisions are in response to the 24-hour-plus protest by
    Democrats last June when they disrupted House floor proceedings to
    protest GOP inaction on gun control legislation in the wake of the
    Orlando nightclub mass shooting, including a proposal to prohibit
    persons on the FBI's terrorism watch list from purchasing firearms.
    When Republicans recessed and eventually adjourned the House,
    Democrats continued to livestream their sit-in from the House
    chamber using smartphone apps." \[Congressional Quarterly,
