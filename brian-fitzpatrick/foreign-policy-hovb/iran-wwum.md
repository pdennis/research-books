    matter. But it is not yet clear if the Department of Justice will
    bring any charges against Malley or what the scope of any charges
    might be. The people were granted anonymity to discuss a highly
    sensitive issue. Malley, who declined to comment, has denied any
    wrongdoing. The insights from the letter and from the people with
    whom POLITICO spoke --- including that a criminal inquiry is
    underway --- add new details to prior reports that Malley's handling
    of classified information was at issue. \[...\] Malley's security
