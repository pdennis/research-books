# Turkey

**2019: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted For The FY 2020 National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA), Which Prohibited Deliver Of F-35 Aircrafts To
Turkey Until They Are No Longer In Possession Of Russian-Made Systems.**
In December 2019, Fitzpatrick effectively voted for the FY 2020 NDAA.
According to Congressional Quarterly, "The agreement prohibits the
delivery of F-35 aircraft or related materials to Turkey unless the
Defense secretary and secretary of State jointly certify that Turkey no
longer possesses the Russian-made S-400 air defense system and has
provided credible assurances that it will not take possession of an
S-400 in the future." The vote was on adoption of the conference report
to accompany the bill. The House adopted the conference report by a vote
of 377-48. The bill was later passed by the Senate and signed into law
by the President. \[House Vote 672,

-   **Turkey Recently Became The Only NATO Member To Purchase
    Russian-Made Systems.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Turkey earlier this year took delivery of a S-400 system from
    Russia, making it the only NATO member to purchase the Russian-made
    system despite U.S. concerns that if Turkey operates both the F-35
    fighter jet and the S-400 system (which would necessitate Russian
    trainers) Russian experts would be better able to study both the
    plane\'s capabilities and potential vulnerabilities. Turkey\'s
    actions prompted the U.S. to drop Turkey from the F-35 program."

Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment to the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2023, which would "prohibit the president from
selling or transferring F-16s or F-16 modernization kits to Turkey
unless the president certifies to Congress that, during the preceding
120-day period, Turkey has not violated the sovereignty of Greece,
including through territorial overflights, or violated the International
Civil Aviation Organization\'s Athens Flight Information Region." The
