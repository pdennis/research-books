-   **Sieg Was Suspended Under The Trump Administration And Restored To
    Her Position When President Biden Was Sworn In; A Later
    Investigation Into The US Agency For Global Media Focused On This
    And That Sieg Had Falsified Her Education Credential And Gave
    "Variable Treatment" To An Employee.** According to Fox News, "In
    particular, the investigation has focused on Setareh Sieg, a VOA
    journalist who was suspended and expected to be fired under the
    Trump administration in early January 2021, only to be restored
    'with no loss of pay or seniority' the day after President Biden was
    sworn in, according to documents obtained by the committee. Sieg\'s
    attorney and USAGM have both pushed back on the committee\'s
    findings." \[Fox News, Their probe has largely focused on
    accusations that Sieg falsified her higher education credentials
    rather than getting a Ph.D. in political history from a French
    university. Republicans obtained communications between the
    University of Paris and the French Embassy in the U.S. that state
    Sieg got 'an establishment degree, not a state doctorate' in
    October 2021. The committee report also detailed whistleblower
    accounts that say Sieg gave variable treatment to at least one
    employee and hired that employee's brother for a senior position."
