### Israel

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Israel Security Assistance
Supplemental Appropriations.** In February 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for ,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would provide
\$17.6 billion in security assistance to Israel to defend itself in war
against Hamas. It would include \$13.9 billion in supplemental
appropriations for the Defense Department and an additional \$3.5
billion in State Department foreign military financing for the sale of
U.S. military equipment to Israel. Appropriations provided to aid Israel
under the bill would be designated as emergency funding and would not

-   **The White House Issued A Veto Threat On The Bill Due To A Lack Of
    Funding For Ukraine.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    White House issued a veto threat on the House bill, which would
    provide \$17.6 billion for Israel and for U.S. operations in the
    Middle East, while delivering nothing for Ukraine, border security
    or the rest of the Senate package. A statement of administration
    policy dismissed the House measure as a 'political ploy' that would
    leave many national security demands unmet. 'Instead of working in
    good faith to address the most pressing national security
    challenges, this bill is another cynical political maneuver,' the
    statement said. 'The security of Israel should be sacred, not a
    political game.'" \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **The House Freedom Caucus Criticized The Bill For Lacking An
    Offset.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans,
    meanwhile, are far from united in support of the bill. The
    rebellious Freedom Caucus, made up of roughly 30 to 40 members,
    issued a statement of opposition over the weekend, attacking
    Johnson, R-La., 'for reversing course on his stance to require new
    supplemental spending to be offset.' Unlike an earlier House-passed
    bill for Israel (HR 6126), the new measure drops a proposed funding
    cut for the IRS. Johnson told reporters last month that it 'makes a
    lot of sense' for Israel aid to have an offset, especially if it
    involves cuts to the IRS. 'We can\'t just keep spending money that
    we don\'t have,' he said. Caroline Coudriet has more on the House
    bill." \[Congressional Quarterly,
