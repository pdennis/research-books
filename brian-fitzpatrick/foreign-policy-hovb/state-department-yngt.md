    eliminate funding for the Green Climate Fund, and reimpose the
    prohibition on federal funding for international non-governmental
    organizations that provide abortion services. As amended, it would
    prohibit the use of funds to pay the expenses and salary of
    Secretary of State Antony Blinken." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/28/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/335)\]

    Logistics Over-the-Shore capability in the Gaza Strip. It would also

    Department to cite statistics from the Gaza Health Ministry."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/28/24](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2024/H/335)\]

    Andy Ogles, R-Tenn, that would prohibit funding to implement the
    Biden administration's recent national security memorandum related
    to oversight on foreign arms transfers that may violate human
    rights. NSM-20, as it's called, has been criticized by hawkish
    pro-Israel supporters because of the spotlight it can shed on how
    the Israeli government is using U.S.-provided weapons in its
    airstrikes and ground offensives in the Gaza Strip." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [6/27/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8043017?2)\]

-   **The Bill Cut Spending By 12 Percent With The Greatest Cuts Being
    To The United Nations, Development Assistance, And Refugees.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill, which funds the
    State Department, U.S. Agency for International Development, and
    other related foreign affairs offices, would make topline cuts of
    nearly 12 percent. The cuts would disproportionately fall upon U.S.
    contributions to the United Nations and to accounts supporting
    development assistance and refugees." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/28/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8043532?2)\]

-   **The Bill Initially Cut Funding For Migration And Refugees By \$1.5
    Billion, However, The House Adopted An Amendment Offered By
    Representative Nancy Mace That Cut That Funding By An Additional
    \$500 Million And Redirected The Funds To International Narcotics
    Control And Law Enforcement Which Had Already Received A 12 Percent
    Funding Boost.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "During
    Thursday\'s amendment debate, the House adopted an amendment from
    Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C. that would further reduce fiscal 2025
    funding for refugees. Though the underlying bill would provide only
    \$2.5 billion to the State Department\'s Migration and Refugee
    assistance account --- \$1.5 billion below current levels --- the
    Mace amendment slashed an additional \$500 million from the account,
    leaving it at less than \$2 billion at a time when the recorded
    levels of global refugees and internally displaced peoples have
    never been so high. The State Department\'s International Narcotics
    Control and Law Enforcement account would receive the \$500 million
    in cut refugee spending. That\'s on top of the \$1.6 billion the
    underlying bill would provide to INCLE activities, which is itself
    12 percent higher than enacted levels and comes as Republicans have
    seized on combating fentanyl trafficking as a priority for the
    party." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/28/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8043532?2)\]

offset, including \$11.1 billion from a rescission of funding from the
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund from the fiscal 2022 budget reconciliation
bill (PL 117-169). The bill would provide \$4.4 billion to counter the
Chinese Communist Party's influence and prohibit the use of funds to
repay loans to the Chinese government or to support forced labor, crimes
against humanity or genocide in China. The bill would provide \$3.1
billion for Israel, \$1.5 billion for Egypt and \$1.7 billion for
Jordan. The bill would also require the executive branch, within 60 days
of enactment, to report to Congress on a strategy to prioritize U.S.
national security interests in responding to the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, and create new monitoring and oversight mechanisms. Among other
provisions, the bill would provide \$10 billion for global health
programs, strike funding for the Green Climate Fund, and reimpose the
prohibition on federal funding for international non-governmental
organizations that provide abortion services. As amended, the bill would
reduce the salary of Secretary of State Antony Blinken to \$1, prohibit

    Gaza Health Ministry, The Only Offical Entity Tracking The Death
    Toll In The Israel-Hamas War.** According to the Hill, "The House
    passed an amendment Thursday barring the State Department from
    citing the Gaza Health Ministry's death toll statistics for the
    Israel-Hamas war, effectively halting discussion of the war's deaths
    if it is signed into law. \[...\] The Gaza Health Ministry has been
    cited by the State Department and news agencies for decades amid
    conflict in Gaza. It's daily death toll during the current conflict
    that began in October has served as a primary source for
    understanding the war's impact on Palestinians in the territory. It
    is the only official entity tracking death data in Gaza, with its
    figures regularly being cited by both U.S. and Israeli officials."
