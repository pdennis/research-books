# North And West Africa

### Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted To Establish The Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism
Partnership Program To Assist With Federal Activities In North And West
Africa, Which Would Aim To Improve Governance And Combat Terrorism And
Violent Extremism.** In June 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for the
Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Program Act of 2021 which
would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "state that it is U.S.
policy to assist countries and partners in North and West Africa in
combating terrorism and violent extremism through a coordinated
interagency approach that balances security activities with diplomatic
and development efforts. It would require the State Department to
formally establish the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Program
to coordinate federal activities in North and West Africa, including
activities related to enhancing state legitimacy by improving governance
and capacity to provide basic services, addressing factors that make
individuals and communities vulnerabilities to terrorist recruitment,
strengthening military and law enforcement capacity to cooperate with
international partners and respond to extremism and terrorism, and
enhancing border security. Among other provisions, it would require the
State Department to submit to Congress, within 270 days of enactment, a
five-year strategy for coordinated U.S. activities in North and West
Africa." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of
395-15. \[House Vote 192,
