    Emergency Declarations Were Old And Were Examples Of The "Deep
    State."** According to Reuters, "The hardliners said the emergency
    declarations, dating back to the presidencies of Republican
    George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama, were out-of-date and had
    become examples of the 'deep state,' former President Donald
    Trump\'s conspiratorial term for Washington officials who opposed
    his will." \[Reuters,

    House of Representatives on Tuesday turned back a bid by hardline
    conservatives to end five presidential emergency declarations that
    allow for sanctions against America\'s enemies in the Middle East
    and Africa. Four Republican Representatives - Lauren Boebert, Matt
    Gaetz, Paul Gosar and Eli Crane - used separate measures known as
    privileged resolutions to require votes on whether to end
    longstanding emergency declarations involving Syria, Yemen, Iraq,
    Libya and Democratic Republic of Congo." \[Reuters,
