    airfields on short notice, provides a rare communications channel
    between Russia and the west, and that the pact\'s restrictions on
    technological innovations reinforce the main purpose of the treaty,
    i.e. verifying what signatories say about their force deployments
    \[...\] The House bill would have prohibited the use of funds to

### Russian War Crimes Against Ukraine

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence
And Accountability Act, Which Expressed That Russia Committed War Crimes
By Invading Ukraine In February 2022 And Directed The Collection Of Data
On War Crimes During The 2022 Russian Invasion To Hold Perpetrators
Accountable.** In April 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted for the Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and
Accountability Act, which would "express the sense of Congress that
Russia has committed war crimes in its invasion of Ukraine beginning in
February 2022; that the Russian use of chemical weapons would be a war
crime; and that Russian President Vladimir Putin has 'a long record' of
committing war crimes and human rights abuses in Russia and abroad. It
would state that it is U.S. policy to collect information on war crimes
during the 2022 Russian invasion and to make efforts to identify, deter
and hold perpetrators accountable for war crimes. It would require the
president to submit a report to Congress on U.S. efforts to collect,
analyze and preserve evidence and information related to war crimes and
other atrocities committed during Russia\'s 2022 invasion of Ukraine,
for use in prosecuting such crimes, and on media and information
operations that inform Russian officials and citizens of efforts to
identify and prosecute war crimes." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 418-7. \[House Vote 121,

### Sanctions

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Impose Sanctions On 328 Members Of The
Russia State Duma.** In April 2022, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Asset Seizure for Ukraine
Reconstruction Act, which in part would "require the president to impose
sanctions on 328 members of the Russian State Duma and determine whether
the remaining members of the Duma and the Russian Federation Council
should be subject to existing sanctions." The vote was on passage. The
House passed the bill by a vote of 417-8, thus the bill was sent to the
Senate. \[House Vote 130,

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted To Disapprove The Trump Administration's
Proposed Suspension Of Sanctions Against A Russian Oligarch Called
Deripaska.** In January 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for a resolution that
would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "force\[d\] the
Treasury Department to keep sanctions on three companies linked to a
Russian oligarch, a tally that contrasts sharply with a Senate vote the
day before. \[...\] The House resolution would keep sanctions on En+
Group, UC Rusal and EuroSibEnergo, three large companies controlled by
Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, who is himself sanctioned separately,
and has been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals,
illegally wiretapping a government official, extortion and
racketeering." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass
the bill. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a
vote of 362 to 53. The Senate had earlier rejected a procedural vote on
a similar resolution. \[House Vote 42,

30](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-joint-resolution/30/all-actions)\]

-   **The Sanctioned Companies Were Involved In Energy And Aluminum.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The companies are engaged in
    aluminum mining, natural gas, energy production and logistics. The
    sanctions are aimed at making Deripaska a minority shareholder in
    the companies rather than having controlling majorities. The
    Treasury Department says Russian ownership and operation of those
    companies have been sufficiently separated from Deripaska, who has
    ties to the Kremlin." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [1/17/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-5446626?21)\]

-   **136 Republicans Voted Yes; The Senate Had Rejected The Legislation
    A Few Days Earlier Having Failed By Three Votes.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "With 136 Republicans backing the measure,
    the resolution (H J Res 30) will likely just showcase the House's
    displeasure with the Trump administration. The Senate is unlikely to
    take up the House measure, having fallen three votes short of
    advancing a similar one Wednesday, 57-42. Without both chambers
    voting to keep the sanctions, Treasury can now lift them, according
    to a 2017 sanctions law (PL 115-44)." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [1/17/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-5446626?21)\]

-   **Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Briefed House Lawmakers On Why The
    Sanctions Should Be Lifted.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met with all House lawmakers Jan.
    10 for a classified briefing on his department's rationale for
    lifting the sanctions. Afterwards, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,
    said the briefing was 'one of the worst classified briefings we've
    received from the Trump administration.'" \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [1/17/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-5446626?21)\]

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For Codifying Sanctions And Creating New
Sanctions On Russia As Part Of A Larger Sanctions Bill On Iran, North
Korea And Russia.** In July 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for legislation that
would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "codif\[ied\] certain
existing sanctions on Russia, including various sanctions tied to
Russia's aggression in Ukraine, Moscow's annexation of Crimea, and
malicious cyber activities relating to the 2016 U.S. elections. The bill
would \[have\] establish multiple new sanctions on Russia, including
sanctions on entities conducting malicious cyber activity on behalf of
the Russian government and entities which conduct business with the
Russian intelligence and defense sectors." In addition, also according
to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "impose\[d\]
various new or expanded sanctions against Iran, including sanctions on
persons that engage in or pose a risk of materially contributing to
Iran's ballistic missile program and sanctions on officials, agents or
affiliates of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The bill would
\[have\] also impose\[d\] multiple new or expanded sanctions on North
Korea, including sanctions against entities that purchase certain metals
or minerals from North Korea, and would \[have\] require\[d\] the
secretary of State to make a determination as to whether North Korea
constitutes a 'state sponsor of terrorism.'" The vote was on passage.
The House passed the bill by a vote of 419 to 3. The Senate then passed
the legislation, sending the bill to President Trump, who signed it into
law. \[House Vote 413,

-   **Legislation Was "Republicans' First Significant Rebuke Of Trump's
    Foreign Policy."** According to The Hill, "The move marks
    congressional Republicans' first significant rebuke of Trump's
    foreign policy, where the administration\'s warmer stance toward
    Russia has drawn heavy skepticism from both parties." \[The Hill,
    [7/27/17](http://thehill.com/policy/international/russia/344221-senate-sends-russia-sanctions-bill-to-trumps-desk)\]

-   **The Bill Would Have Blocked Trump's Ability To Return The Seized
    Russian Compounds And Gave Congress The Ability To Block His Ability
    To Lift Or Lessen Sanctions On Russia.** According to The Hill, "The
    bill would block the administration\'s ability to return the
    compounds without congressional approval. In addition to slapping
    new financial penalties on Moscow, it would give Congress 30 days
    --- or 60 days around the August recess --- to review and
    potentially block Trump from lifting or relaxing Russia sanctions;
    as well as codify the sanctions on Russia imposed by executive order
    by the Obama administration, and allow the Trump administration to
    impose new sanctions." \[The Hill,

-   **The Bill Allowed Any Representative To Force A Vote Blocking
    Sanctions Relief "That Had Already Passed In The Senate."**
    According to The Hill, "A compromise reached over the weekend
    ensures that any House member can force a vote on a resolution of
    disapproval to block sanctions relief that has already passed in the
    Senate." \[The Hill,
    [7/27/17](http://thehill.com/policy/international/russia/344221-senate-sends-russia-sanctions-bill-to-trumps-desk)\]

-   **Trump Argued The Bill Was Flawed And That It Would Make It More
    Difficult To Negotiate Better Deals Since The Bill Restricted His
    Authority To Life Russian Sanctions.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "President Donald Trump sharply criticized a bipartisan
    sanctions bill he signed into law Wednesday, arguing it was
    'seriously flawed' and would make it harder to 'strike good deals'
    because the measure restricts his ability to lift sanctions on
    Russia." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [8/2/17](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5157124?4)\]

-   **Trump Claimed That The Provisions That Provided U.S. Support To
    Ukraine And Condemned The Illegal Invasion Of Crimea Were "Clearly
    Unconstitutional."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "In an
    accompanying five-page signing statement, Trump highlighted a number
    of bill provisions that he said are 'clearly unconstitutional,'
    including a section that states it is U.S. policy to support the
    government of Ukraine and that the United States does not recognize
    territorial changes affected by force, including the illegal
    invasion and occupation of Crimea." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [8/2/17](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5157124?4)\]

-   **Trump Claimed The Bill Infringed On The Presidential Powers To
    Recognize Foreign Governments And That It Concluded With A The
    Zivotofsky V. Kerry Supreme Court Ruling.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Trump said he agreed with the policy of
    not recognizing territory forcefully annexed by Russia, but the
    measure infringes on 'the president's exclusive constitutional
    authority to recognize foreign governments, including their
    territorial bounds, in conflict with the Supreme Court's recent
    decision in Zivotofsky v. Kerry.'" \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [8/2/17](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5157124?4)\]

-   **Trump Criticized Language That Gave Congress The Authority To
    Review And Vote On Any Proposed Lax On Russian Sanctions.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The president also criticized
    language that gives Congress the right to review and vote on any
    proposed easing of sanctions on Russia as being 'outside the
    constitutionally required process.' The president said he would
    likely honor that provision but did not promise to do so. 'I
    nevertheless expect to honor the bill's extended waiting periods to
    ensure that the Congress will have a full opportunity to avail
    itself of the bill's review procedures,' he said." \[Congressional

    Involvement In Eastern Ukraine, For Supporting The Assad Regime In
    Syria, And For Interfering In The 2016 U.S. Presidential
    Elections.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The new
    sanctions on Russia are punishment for its continued military
    involvement in eastern Ukraine, support for the Assad regime in
    Syria and its interference in the 2016 presidential elections."

### Suspending Trade Relations With Russia And Belarus

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Suspending Normal Trade Relations With
Russia And Belarus Act, Which Allowed President Biden To Increase
Tariffs On Russian And Belarusian Goods Until January 2024.** In April
2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted to concur
in the Senate amendment to the Suspending Normal Trade Relations with
Russia and Belarus Act, which in part would "remove the normal trade
relations status of Russia and Belarus with the United States, effective
the day after the bill\'s enactment. It would authorize the president,
until January 1, 2024, to further increase tariffs on goods from Russia
and Belarus following consultation with Congress. It would authorize the
president to restore the trade status of either country after certifying
to Congress that the country\'s president has reached an agreement with
the independent government of Ukraine to withdraw Russian or Belarusian
forces and cease military hostilities; poses no immediate military
threat of aggression to any NATO member; and recognizes the right of the
people of Ukraine to independently and freely choose their own
government. It also would establish congressional procedures for
consideration of a joint resolution of disapproval for such a
certification. The vote was on a motion to concur. The House concurred
with the Senate by a vote of 420-3, thus the bill was sent to the
President and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 124,
