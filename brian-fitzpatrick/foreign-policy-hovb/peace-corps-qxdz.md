# Peace Corps

### Reauthorization

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Authorize \$430.5 Million Annually For FY
2023-2024 For The Peace Corps, Ensure Volunteers Have Access To
Menstrual Products, Expand The Readjustment Monthly Allowance, And
Provide Short-Term Health Insurance.** In September 2022, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Peace Corps
Reauthorization Act of 2022, which would "authorize \$430.5 million
annually for fiscal years 2023 and 2024 for the Peace Corps and make
various modifications to Peace Corps volunteer benefits and operations.
The bill would require the Peace Corps to consult with outside experts,
specifically regarding the mental health care provided to volunteers
during their service and to establish a policy to ensure that volunteers
have access to menstrual products, either by increasing their stipends
or directly providing the products. For returning volunteers, it would
expand the readjustment allowance from \$125 to \$375 per month served
and provide for two months of short-term health insurance. It would
codify an executive order granting former volunteers noncompetitive
eligibility for federal civil service positions and expand the term of
eligibility from one year to two years. Among other provisions, it would
require the Peace Corps to waive certain application requirements and
prioritize medical clearance for returning volunteers whose service
ended involuntarily, including due to suspension of operations, and to
establish a policy to prevent retaliation by supervisors against
volunteers. It would allow the corps to recruit volunteers to provide
online services virtually from outside a host country and, at the
request of other agencies, to recruit volunteers to serve within the
U.S. for short terms." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 290-125. The Senate did not take substantive action on
the bill. \[House Vote 440,
