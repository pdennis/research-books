    move that would have had the same effect as an amendment, would have
    shifted \$102.5 million from the foreign aid account that funds

    and democracy-building activities. Republicans said the intent was
    to take the money out of \$500 million set aside for 'a dedicated
    international' fund to help developing nations reduce greenhouse gas
    emissions, such as the United Nations\' Green Climate Fund. Instead,
    the \$102.5 million would be shifted to a newly established
    'Countering Chinese Influence Fund,' which was funded at 'not less
    than' \$300 million in fiscal 2020 " \[Congressional Quarterly,

    pushing Republican conspiracy theories and partisan talking points,'
    Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said. 'We certainly don't want it to
    turn into a place that perpetuates anti-Asian hate.' McGovern cited
    the example of former President Donald Trump mislabeling COVID-19 by
    tying it to Chinese people, a comment McGovern said led to incidents
    of violence against Asian Americans. McCarthy said he had similar
    concerns about the committee turning into promoting unproven
    theories and reassured Democrats that the committee would not resort
    to such tactics." \[Congressional Quarterly,
