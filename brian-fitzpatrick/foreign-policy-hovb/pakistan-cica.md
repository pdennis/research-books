**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Support Democracy And Human Rights In
Pakistan, To Increase Engagement With The Government Of Pakistan, and To
Condemn Voter Suppression Efforts In Pakistan.** In June 2024,
Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the
resolution, as amended, that would express support for democracy and
human rights in Pakistan. The resolution would call on the president and
secretary of State to strengthen engagement with the government of
Pakistan to ensure democracy, human rights and the rule of law, as well
as urge the government of Pakistan to uphold those same principles. The
bill also would condemn any attempts to suppress voter participation or
Pakistan's electoral or judicial processes. It also would call for an
independent investigation into allegations of interference or
irregularities in Pakistan's February 2024 election." The vote was on
passage. The House adopted the resolution by a vote of 368 to 7, thus,
it was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 280,
