    rejected the resolutions in a series of votes, after mainstream
    Republicans and Democrats warned that ending the emergencies would
    unfreeze the assets of militia leaders, arms dealers and accused war
    criminals, while denying compensation to U.S. victims of terrorism."

-   **The Far-Right Republicans Who Sponsored The Resolutions Argued The
    Emergency Declarations Were Old And Were Examples Of The "Deep
    State."** According to Reuters, "The hardliners said the emergency
    declarations, dating back to the presidencies of Republican
    George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama, were out-of-date and had
    become examples of the 'deep state,' former President Donald
    Trump\'s conspiratorial term for Washington officials who opposed
    his will." \[Reuters,

    Declarations That Have Permitted Sanctions Against U.S. Enemies In
    The Middle East And Africa, Including Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Libya And

    House of Representatives on Tuesday turned back a bid by hardline
    conservatives to end five presidential emergency declarations that
    allow for sanctions against America\'s enemies in the Middle East
    and Africa. Four Republican Representatives - Lauren Boebert, Matt
    Gaetz, Paul Gosar and Eli Crane - used separate measures known as
    privileged resolutions to require votes on whether to end
    longstanding emergency declarations involving Syria, Yemen, Iraq,
    Libya and Democratic Republic of Congo." \[Reuters,

humanitarian aid in Libya and authorize \$30 million in fiscal 2022 for
the State Department to support efforts to resolve and respond to the
current civil conflict, such as activities to promote democratic
governance, combat corruption and human rights violations, and support
independent media. It would require the State Department to submit

involvement of other foreign governments in Libya." The vote was on
