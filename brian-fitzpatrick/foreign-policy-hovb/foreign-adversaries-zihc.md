### Biotechnology Products And Services

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Prohibit The Federal Government from
Procuring Biotechnology Products And Services From Foreign Adversaries
Or Contracting With Companies That Use Such Products.** In September
2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the
bill, as amended, that would prohibit federal agencies from procuring,
purchasing or obtaining biotechnology products or services from a
biotechnology company that is controlled or operated on behalf of a
foreign adversary. It also would prohibit agencies from entering into,
renewing or extending a contract with an entity that uses those products
or services from such a 'company of concern.' Prohibitions on five
companies \-- BGI, MGI, Complete Genomics, WuXi AppTec and WuXi
Biologics \-- would go into effect 60 days after the Federal Acquisition
Regulatory Council revises regulations to implement the bill\'s
requirements. Additional companies of concern could be added by the
Office of Management and Budget, based on recommendations of the Defense
Department in consultation with other federal agencies, 180 days after
the revisions." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 306 to 81. \[House Vote 402,
