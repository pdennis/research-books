# Travel Ban

### Cancelling Trump's Travel Ban

**2020: Fitzpatrick Voted For Repealing Trump's Travel Bans And
Prohibiting Religious Discrimination In The Process Of Issuing Visas.**
In July 2020, Fitzpatrick voted for the No Ban Act that would, according
to Congressional Quarterly, "terminate a number of executive orders and
proclamations by the president restricting entry into the United States
from certain countries, including Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan,
Syria and Yemen. It would explicitly prohibit discrimination based on
religion with regard to individuals seeking entry into the United
States. It would limit the president\'s ability to restrict entry of a
class of foreign nationals, including to require that such restrictions
be temporary, narrowly tailored and subject to a State Department
determination that they are in the interest of U.S. public safety or
international stability. It would allow individuals present in the
United States who are harmed by entry restrictions in violation of the
bill\'s provisions to seek relief." The vote was on a motion to concur
in the Senate amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of
233-183. The bill never became law. \[House Vote 153,

-   **The Bill Repealed The Trump Administration's Ban On Travel
    Restrictions From Certain Nations And Prohibited Future Presidents
    From Implementing Bans Based On Race Or Religion.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The House passed a measure Wednesday that
    would repeal the Trump administration's ban on restricting travel
    from targeted nations and prohibit future presidents from
    implementing bans based on race or religion. \[...\] The legislation
    would lift restrictions President Donald Trump has put on numerous
    countries over the years, including travel limits initially placed
    on a group of predominantly Muslim nations." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [7/22/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5963101?3)\]

-   **The Bill Strengthened The Immigration Nationality Act By
    Prohibiting Religious Discrimination In The Process Of Issuing
    Visas.** According to Vox, "The bill would also strengthen existing
    prohibitions on religious discrimination in visa applications, which
    are guaranteed by the Immigration Nationality Act (INA). Immigrant
    advocates have praised the House's measure as a means of protecting
    the rights of American Muslims \[...\] The INA currently bans
    discrimination in the issuance of visas only on the basis of 'race,
    sex, nationality, place of birth and place of residence.' There is
    no provision prohibiting religious discrimination, which made it
    more difficult for immigrant advocates to argue that the travel ban
    was unlawful." \[Vox,

-   **The Bill Placed Stricter Restrictions On Future Travel Bans.**
    According to Vox, "The No Ban Act would amend the current law to
    require that any travel ban be temporary, based on credible
    evidence, subject to congressional oversight, and be created only in
    response to specific actions foreign entities have taken to threaten
    the US. The bill also states that a ban must also advance a
    compelling government interest in the least restrictive way
    possible." \[Vox,
    [7/22/20](https://www.vox.com/2020/7/22/21332511/no-ban-act-travel-ban-bill-trump)\]

-   **The Trump Administration Argued That The Bill Would Pose A Threat
    To National Security And Specifically Hurt Recent Efforts In
    Combatting COVID-19.** According to Vox, "The Trump administration
    has argued that the bill will pose a threat to US national security,
    divert resources away from cooperating with foreign governments to
    improve screening, and diminish what has recently been a critical
    tool for combatting Covid-19. In recent months, Trump has blocked
    all travelers who have been in China, Iran, Europe, and Brazil
    within the last 14 days." \[Vox,

**2017: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against Considering Legislation
Cancelling President Trump's Travel Ban.** In January 2017, Fitzpatrick
voted for a motion to order the previous question on a rule that would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for House floor
consideration of the joint resolution (H J Res 38) that would nullify
and disapprove of an Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and
Enforcement rule that requires surface coal mining operations, to the
extent possible, to avoid disturbing streams and land within 100 feet of
the streams." According to House Democratic leader, "The Democratic
previous question would amend the rule to allow for consideration of
H.R. 724, the statue of liberty values act of 2017, which provides that
President Trump's immigration executive order shall have no force or
effect." The vote was on a motion to order the previous question. The
House agreed to the motion, thereby preventing consideration of the
Democratic previous question, by a vote of 236 to 183. \[House Vote 68,

-   **House Rules Committee Republican Staff: A Vote To Order The
    Previous Question On A Rule Is "A Vote About What The House Should
    Be Debating" Which "Does Have Substantive Policy Implications."**
    According to a 2010 memo written by the then-House Rules Committee's
    minority staff, "This vote, the vote on whether to order the
    previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural
    vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote
    against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow the
    opposition, at least for the moment, to offer an alternative plan.
    It is a vote about what the House should be debating. \[...\]
    Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have
    substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available
    tools for those who oppose the Democratic majority's agenda and
    allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an
    alternative plan." \["The Vote on the Previous Question: What It
    Really Means," House Rules Committee Minority Staff Memo,
    [3/18/10](http://www.speaker.gov/sites/speaker.house.gov/files/UploadedFiles/03-18-10_Previous_Question_is_NOT_Just_a_Procedural_Vote.pdf)\]

-   **If The House Had Refused To Order The Previous Question, The
    Minority Would Assume Control Of The House Floor For An Hour And
    Could Offer A Germane Amendment To The Rule.** According to a 2010
    memo written by the then-House Rules Committee's minority staff,
    "Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic majority
    they will say 'the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on
    whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution
    ... \[and\] has no substantive legislative or policy implications
    whatsoever.' But that is not what they have always said. Listen to
    the definition of the previous question used in the Floor Procedures
    Manual published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress, (page
    56). Here's how the Rules Committee described the rule using
    information from Congressional Quarterly's 'American Congressional
    Dictionary': 'If the previous question is defeated, control of
    debate shifts to the leading opposition member (usually the minority
    Floor Manager) who then manages an hour of debate and may offer a
    germane amendment to the pending business.'" \["The Vote on the
    Previous Question: What It Really Means," House Rules Committee
