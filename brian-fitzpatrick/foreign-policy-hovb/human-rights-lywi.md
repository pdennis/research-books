### Calling For Information And Investigation Over Missing Chinese Olympian

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted To Call On China To Provide Information Over
Olympian Peng Shuai's Whereabouts, Who Was Missing After Accusing A
Chinese Official Of Sexual Assault, Properly Investigate And Commit To
Holding Offenders Accountable.** In December 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for
the resolution which would, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"express the sense of the House of Representatives that the actions of
China and the International Olympic Committee in relation to the
disappearance of Peng Shuai raise concerns regarding freedom of speech
and the safety of athletes participating in the 2022 Olympic and
Paralympic games in Beijing and the IOC\'s ability and willingness to
protect these athletes. Peng is a Chinese tennis player and three-time
Olympian who is missing after accusing a Chinese government official of
sexual assault. It would call on China to provide independent
information on Peng\'s whereabouts, investigate her allegations fairly
and transparently and publicly commit to holding perpetrators
accountable for sexual violence. It would urge the IOC to also publicly
call on China to undertake these actions." The vote was on passage. The
House passed the resolution by a vote of 428-0. \[House Vote 413,
