### Countering Russian Influence

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require The State Department To Develop A
Strategy For The U.S. To Counter Russia Influence In Africa And Submit
An Annual Assessment For Five Years Of The Scope Of Russian Influence In
Africa With The Efforts Enacted To Counter Russian Influence.** In April
2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the
Countering Malign Russian Activities in Africa Act, which would "require
the State Department to develop and submit to Congress a strategy and
implementation plan for U.S. efforts to counter the malign influence and
activities of Russian and its proxies in Africa, including initiatives
to strengthen democratic institutions; improve human rights standards;
monitor natural resources and extractive industries; and monitor Russian
political influence and the activities of Russian or Russian-affiliated
private military contractors. It would require the department, annually
for five years, to submit a report to Congress on the plan, including an
assessment of the scope of Russian influence in Africa; details on
efforts undertaken and policy and resources needed to effectively
counter such influence; and an identification of foreign entities that
have provided transportation or money transfer services to Russian
mercenaries in Libya, with an analysis of whether such entities are
subject to sanctions." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 415-9, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House
