-   **There Is Concern That President Trump Wants To Withdraw From
    NATO.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The U.S. commitment
    to Article 5 has recently come into question. During the 2016
    presidential campaign, Donald Trump at one point called NATO
    'obsolete' and indicated that the United States shouldn't
    necessarily come to the defense of a NATO ally unless that nation
    had met its commitment to spend at least 2% of their gross domestic
    product on defense, arguing that most alliance members have been
    getting a 'free ride' from the United States. And at the NATO summit
    in Brussels in May 2017, President Trump failed to explicitly state
    U.S. support for Article 5 while continuing to criticize other NATO
    nations for their failure to meet the 2% defense funding level
    (although he subsequently reaffirmed U.S. support for Article 5).
    The United States spends close to 4% of GDP on defense, and provides
    the vast majority of support for most NATO operations. Last week,
    The New York Times reported that senior administration officials
    stated that President Trump several times last year had privately
    said he wanted to withdraw from NATO. Also last week, Trump in a
    speech at the Pentagon said, 'We're gonna be with NATO 100 percent,
    but as I told the countries, 'You have to step up and you have to
    pay.'" \[Congressional Quarterly,

Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for a resolution that would
"state that the House of Representatives reaffirms its unequivocal
support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as an alliance
founded on democratic principles and urges NATO to continue to support
the people of Ukraine as they fight for their sovereignty, territorial
integrity and a democratic future. It would call on the president to use
the voice and vote of the United States to adopt a new strategic concept
for NATO that is clear about its support for shared democratic values
and committed to enhancing NATO\'s capacity to strengthen democratic
institutions within member, partner and aspirant countries. It would
also call on the president to support the establishment of a Center for
Democratic Resilience within NATO headquarters." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 362-63. \[House
