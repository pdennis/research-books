# Central And Eastern Europe

### Telecommunications Security

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Support The European Union And The Central
And Eastern European Governments In Improving The Security Of Their
Telecommunication Networks, Including Projects That Would Advance U.S.
National Security.** In April 2022, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Transatlantic Telecommunications
Security Act, which would "require the State Department to expedite its
efforts to support the European Union and the Central and Eastern
European governments in improving the security of their
telecommunication networks, including by providing diplomatic and
political support for telecommunications infrastructure projects that
would advance U.S. national security, encouraging international
financial institutions to invest in such projects, removing
telecommunications equipment provided by Chinese and Russian companies,
and facilitating international coordination on cross-border
telecommunications." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill
by a vote of 366-60, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote
