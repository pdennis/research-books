### Human Rights Concerns

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require Governmental Actions To Support
Free, Fair And Transparent Elections And Protect Human Rights In
Nicaragua, Including Imposing Sanctions, Increasing Oversight Of
Financial Assistance For Nicaraguan Projects, And Requiring Various
State Department Reports Over Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's
Corruption.** In November 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for the Reinforcing
Nicaragua\'s Adherence to Conditions for Electoral Reform Act of 2021
which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "express the sense of
Congress and require the U.S. government to take certain actions related
to supporting free, fair and transparent elections and protecting human
rights in Nicaragua. It would require the State and Treasury departments
to take actions to align diplomatic engagement efforts with the
implementation of targeted sanctions, including through international
coordination, to support efforts to facilitate the necessary conditions
for democratic elections in Nicaragua. Among other provisions, it would
require U.S. directors at international financial institutions to
increase oversight of any loans or assistance provided for projects in
Nicaragua and require the president to impose visa sanctions on
individuals who have committed acts of corruption in Nicaragua. It would
also require the State Department to submit a number of reports to
Congress regarding Nicaragua, including reports on corruption involving
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, his family and senior officials in
his government; Russian activities, including military- or
intelligence-related sales to the Nicaraguan government; human rights
abuses by the Ortega government; and strategies to strengthen free press
and expression. The measure is now cleared for the president." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 387-35, sent to
the President and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 354,
