# Global Food Security

### Reauthorization

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Reauthorize 2016 Global Food Security Act
Programs And Activities, Which Promote Global Good Security And
Agricultural Development.** In September 2022, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Global Food Security
Reauthorization Act of 2022, which would "expand and reauthorize through
fiscal 2028 programs and activities of the State Department and U.S.
Agency for International Development under the 2016 Global Food Security
Act to promote global food security and agricultural development. It
would authorize \$1.2 billion annually for fiscal years 2024 through
2028 to carry out the president's Global Food Security Strategy and
\$3.9 billion annually in the same period for USAID's Emergency Food
Security Program, which provides resources for local and regional
governments to purchase emergency food aid. It would also require the
president to provide an update to Congress, at least every five years
through fiscal 2030, on the strategy and related agency-specific plans."
The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 331-95.
The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote
