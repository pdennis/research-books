that would contribute to, or pose a risk of materially contributing to,
the production or distribution of captagon. It also would sanction those
who knowingly receive property or interest in property that the foreign
person knows is associated with the illicit production and distribution
of captagon. Sanctions would include prohibiting transactions in
property or interests in property; ineligibility for visas, admission or
being paroled into the U.S. and the revocation of any current visa. The
bill would allow sanctions to be waived if the president submits a
written determination and justification to the House Foreign Affairs and
Judiciary committees and the Senate Foreign Relations, Judiciary and
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs committees if the waiver is important
to the national security interests of the United States. It also would

impose sanctions on any person or entity that provides significant
financial, material, or technological support to specific Syrian groups
and companies. It would prohibit any action by the U.S. government to
recognize or imply that the U.S. recognizes Bashar al-Assad or any
government in Syria that is led by him. It also would expand who is
sanctionable to include adult family members of a foreign person who
violated the prohibition in the law, along with any entities owned or
controlled by such individuals, with the exception of family members who
the president determines have dissociated themselves from such
individuals. Under the bill, sanctionable conduct would include

providing significant financial, material or technological support to
(or knowingly engaging in a significant transaction with) Syria Arab
Airlines, Cham Wings or any foreign entity owned or controlled by either

Turkish military acts with restraint in Syria; and call on the Trump
administration to present a 'clear and specific' plan for the defeat of
