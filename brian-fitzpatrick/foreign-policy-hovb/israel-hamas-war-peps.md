### International Criminal Court

**2025: Fitzpatrick Voted To Sanction The International Criminal Court
For Indicting Israel.** In January 2025, Fitzpatrick voted for ,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would require the
president to impose U.S. property blocking and visa sanctions on
International Criminal Court officials and others involved with bringing
indictments against certain \"protected\" persons, including Israeli and
U.S. officials. Under the measure, sanctions could include the denial or
revocation of visas to enter the U.S., asset freezes on property in the
U.S., and restrictions on transactions in financial, securities and
currency markets. Protected individuals would include U.S. persons
(explicitly including current or former members of the U.S. military and
elected or appointed U.S. officials) unless the U.S. provides formal
consent to ICC jurisdiction over genocide, war crimes, crimes against
humanity and the crime of aggression. Citizens or lawful residents of
U.S. allies who have not consented to ICC jurisdiction (such as Israeli
officials) also would be considered protected individuals. It also would
rescind funds appropriated and made available for the ICC, effective on
the date of the bill's enactment. It also would prohibit future
appropriations to the ICC." The House passed the bill by a vote of 243
to 140. \[House Vote 7,

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Impose Sanctions On International Criminal
Court Officials That Bring Indictments Against U.S. And Israeli
Officials.** In June 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to
Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would require the president to
impose sanctions on International Criminal Court officials and others
involved with bringing ICC indictments against certain 'protected'
persons, including Israeli and U.S. officials. Under the measure,
sanctions could include the denial or revocation of visas to enter the
U.S., asset freezes on property in the U.S., and restrictions on
transactions in financial, securities and currency markets. Protected
persons would include U.S. persons (explicitly including current and
former members of the U.S. military and elected and appointed U.S.
officials), as well as citizens of U.S. allies who are not party to the
ICC (such as Israeli officials). It would rescind funds appropriated and
made available for the ICC, effective on the date of the bill's
enactment. It also would prohibit future appropriations to the ICC." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 247 to 155.

-   **The Legislation Resulted From The ICC's Indictment Of Israeli
    Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu And Defense Minister Yoav Gallant
    For The Starvation In Gaza Caused By Israeli Policies, Which Israel
    Disputed Citing A Lack Of ICC Jurisdiction.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The measure (HR 8282) from Rep. Chip Roy,
    R-Texas, was introduced a month ago but skipped the committee markup
    process as GOP lawmakers rushed a floor vote to send a message of
    support to Israel after the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, two weeks
    ago requested indictments be issued against Israeli Prime Minister
    Benyamin Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant as well
    as senior Hamas officials for war crimes and crimes against
    humanity. \[\...\] Khan heavily focused his case for indictment on
    evidence that Israeli government policies have caused widespread
    starvation and even famine in Gaza. Starvation of civilians as a
    method of warfare is a war crime that violates the Rome Statute,
    which established the ICC. Israel and its U.S. backers say the ICC
    doesn\'t have jurisdiction because Israel, like the U.S., never
    signed the Rome Statute. But because Palestine, which the U.S. and
    Israel don\'t recognize as a sovereign nation, signed the Rome
    Statute, the ICC says it has jurisdiction over alleged crimes
    covered by its mandate in the Gaza Strip." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [6/4/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8025823?2)\]

### Support Israel And Condemnation Of Hamas

**2024: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted To Oppose One-Sided Pressure On
Israel Regarding Gaza.** In April 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for ,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "the rule (H Res 1137) that would
provide for floor consideration of \[...\] the resolution (H Res 1117)
opposing efforts to place one-sided pressure on Israel with respect to
Gaza\[\...\]. The rule would provide for up to one hour of debate on HR
529, H Res 1112, H Res 1117 and HR 7888." The vote was on the rule. The
House adopted the rule by a vote of 213 to 208. \[House Vote 113,

the rules and agree to the resolution that would reaffirm Israel's right
to self defense, condemn Hamas' war against Israel and call on other
countries to do the same. The resolution also calls for Hamas to cease
violent attacks, safely release all living hostages and return the
bodies of deceased hostages. The resolution would also reaffirm the
United States' commitment to Israel's security and condemn Iran's
support for terrorist groups, including Hamas and the Palestinian
Islamic Jihad. The resolution would also urge enforcement of U.S.
sanctions against Iran to prevent Iran's funding of terrorist groups."
