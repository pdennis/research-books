### Interagency Working Group

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Direct The President To Establish An
Interagency Working Group To Coordinate Global Partners To Address
Communications Networks, Security And Standards, Including 5G Systems
And Infrastructure, And Monitor Engagement By The Chinese Government.**
In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted
for the Promoting United States International Leadership in 5G Act of
2021, which would "direct the president to establish an interagency
working group to coordinate with international partners regarding
engagement at international organizations that address communications
networks, security and standards, including 5G and future generations of
mobile telecommunications systems and infrastructure. It would require
the secretary of State to coordinate with the working group to develop
and implement a strategy for diplomatic engagement with allies,
including to share security risk information and coordinate to mitigate
risks related to 5G and future generations of mobile telecommunications
systems, and to monitor engagement by the Chinese government and related
entities at international organizations. It would require the working
group to brief Congress within 180 of enactment regarding both the
strategy and Chinese engagement." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote 405-20, thus the bill was sent to the Senate.
The Senate did not take substantive action on the legislation. \[House
