# Bureau Of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, And Explosives

### Firearm Brace Rule

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Disapproving A Rule From The Bureau Of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, And Explosives That Expanded The Definition
Of "Short-Barreled Rifle" To Include A Pistol With A Stabilizing
Brace.** In June 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick
voted against a resolution that would "provide for congressional
disapproval of the January 2023 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms,
and Explosives rule that expands the definition of a 'short-barreled
rifle' to include a pistol equipped with a stabilizing brace attachment.
The rule also subjects such firearms to heightened regulations under the
National Firearms Act, including taxation, identification and
registration requirements, and as of May 31, 2023 required owners to
register, modify or destroy such firearms. Under the provisions of the
joint resolution, the ATF rule would have no force or effect." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 219 to 210,
thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate rejected the
resolution. \[House Vote 252,

-   **The Resolution Would Overturn A Biden Administration Rule That
    Tightened Federal Regulations On Pistol Braces.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "House Republicans passed a joint
    resolution Tuesday that would overturn the Biden administration's
    rule to tighten federal regulations on pistol braces, an effort that
    faces a veto threat from President Joe Biden." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [6/13/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7768495?14)\]

-   **Republicans Argued The Rule Violated Second Amendment Rights
    Because IT Required Brace Owners To Register Their Firearms As
    Rifles.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Tuesday's 219-210
    vote, which included two Democrats voting for the measure (H J
    Res 44) and two Republicans voting against it, comes days after the
    administration's rule was set to go into effect. Republicans argued
    the regulation, which would require brace owners to register them as
    rifles, surrender them or take them off their firearms, violates
    Second Amendment rights." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/13/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7768495?14)\]

-   **Supporters Of The Resolution Argued That Braces Help People With
    Disabilities Use Firearms And Emphasized That Braces Were Legal For
    Years Before The Rule.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Speaking to reporters before the vote Tuesday, Majority Leader
    Steve Scalise, R-La., criticized the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
    Firearms and Explosives for acting as their own legislators. Scalise
    and other backers of the overturn effort argued the braces help
    disabled people use firearms and have been legal for years."

-   **Democrats Argued Pistol Brace Regulation Was Necessary To Prevent
    More Deaths After They Were Used In Several Mass Shootings.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The pistol braces were
    targeted by regulators after they were used in several mass
    shootings and Democrats have argued that the regulation is needed to
    prevent more deaths. The Biden administration said the president
    would veto the resolution if it passed Congress." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [6/13/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7768495?14)\]

-   **Conservatives And Gun Rights Groups Supported The Resolution And
    The Rule Was Being Challenged In Court.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The regulation has become a sticking point among
    conservatives, and gun rights groups like the Gun of Owners of
    America have urged Congress to pass the disapproval resolution. The
    rule would have gone into effect June 1, but the U.S. Court of
    Appeals for the 5th Circuit temporarily stayed the rule while a
    challenge plays out in the courts." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/13/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7768495?14)\]

-   **Republicans Claimed The Rule Would Incriminate Unknowing Gun
    Owners And Argued The Bureau Of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms And
    Explosives Had Previously Given Conflicting Positions On Pistol
    Braces.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans contend
    the regulation violates Second Amendment rights and would expose
    unknowing gun owners to criminal liability. They also argue the
    Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has given
    conflicting messages in the past on the topic." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [6/22/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7776894?17)\]

-   **The Rule Required Gun Owners To Register Pistols With Braces That
    Turn The Firearm Into Short-Barreled Rifles Or The Gun Owners Could
    Surrender The Firearm Or Take Off The Brace.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The rule from the ATF requires gun owners
    to register pistols with stabilizing braces that turn them into
    short-barreled rifles. Other options for gun owners include
    surrendering the firearm or taking off the stabilizing brace from
    the firearm." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/22/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7776894?17)\]

**2023: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted To Disapprove A Rule From The
Bureau Of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, And Explosives Regarding Firearm
Stabilizing Braces.** In June 2023, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the "adoption of the rule (H Res 495)
that would provide for House floor consideration of \[...\] the joint
resolution (H J Res 44) providing for congressional disapproval of a
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives rule relating to
firearm stabilizing braces." The vote was on the adoption of the rule.
The House adopted the rule by a vote of 218 to 209. \[House Vote 250,

-   **Far-Right Republicans Previously Blocked A Rule On Several Bills
    Since It Did Not Include The Pistol Brace Resolution And Were
    Finally Able To Continue Legislative Work Once They Added The
    Resolution To The Votes.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Conservatives within the Republican caucus picked a fight over the
    resolution and other grievances with Speaker Kevin McCarthy on
    Tuesday of last week. They voted down a rule on several bills, the
    first time that has happened in two decades, which paralyzed the
    floor for the remainder of the week. Leaders agreed to set Tuesday's
    vote as part of a broader pact to get the House floor functioning
    again." \[Congressional Quarterly,
