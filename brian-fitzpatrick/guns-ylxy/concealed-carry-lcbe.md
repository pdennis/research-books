# Concealed Carry

### Allow Concealed Carry Reciprocity

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Requiring Concealed Carry Reciprocity
Between The States.** In December 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against
legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"permit\[ted\] any individual authorized by their home state to carry a
concealed handgun to also carry that concealed weapon in any other state
that permits the carrying of concealed weapons. The bill would \[have\]
require\[d\] a twice-annual certification by all federal agencies,
federal courts and state governments, in coordination with the
Department of Justice, to verify that all relevant data has been
reported and uploaded to the National Instant Criminal Background Check
System regarding individuals who are not eligible to purchase firearms."
The vote was on passage. The House adopted the bill by a vote of 231 to
198. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House

-   **Bill Opponents Fear That The Bill Would Undermine Local Laws,
    Essentially Allowing The Loosest Gun Laws To Prevail.** According to
    Vox, "Yet the bill's critics say it undermines state and local laws,
    effectively forcing states or municipalities with higher
    restrictions to hew to the loosest laws, regardless of individual
    states' public safety needs. The common analogy, which New York City
    officials immediately brought up: armed tourists in Times Square. On
    New Year's Eve." \[Vox,

-   **35 States Prevent Those With Misdemeanor Domestic Abuse From
    Getting A Concealed Carry Permit, But Those Same People Could Get A
    License In One Of The 15 Other States.** According to Vox, "For
    example, according to data from Everytown for Gun Safety (which
    opposes the bill), 35 states and DC prevent significant others who
    are convicted of misdemeanor domestic abuse from obtaining concealed
    carry permits. Under the House bill, those people could potentially
    get a permit in a less restrictive state and it would be valid
    everywhere." \[Vox,
    [12/11/17](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/11/16743108/house-republicans-concealed-carry-reciprocity-bill)\]

-   **One Study Found A Correlation (But Not Causation) Between 'May
    Issue' States And Lower Homicide Rate.** And According to Vox, "A
    2017 analysis led by Michael Siegel of Boston University's School of
    Public Heath analyzed 'shall issue' and 'may issue' states from 1991
    to 2015, and found that 'may issue' states --- those that tend to
    have stricter standards --- had a lower homicide rate than 'shall
    issue' states. 'Shall issue' states were associated with 6.5 percent
    higher total homicide rates, an 8.6 percent higher firearm homicide
    rate, and a 10.6 percent higher handgun homicide rate than in 'may
    issue' states. (Permitless states were left out of the study.)"

-   **Bill Proponents See The Bill As A Way To Nullify Strict Local Gun
    Laws.** According to Vox, "Gun control advocates, on the other hand,
    see this simplification as akin to a nullification of the strongest
    gun laws. Tough states would have to honor permits from visitors
    who, if they were residents, wouldn't legally be able to carry a
    weapon. Under the House (but not Senate) version of the bill, states
    would also have to honor reciprocity for non-resident permits,
    meaning those who don't meet the legal requirements in their home
    state could now obtain a non-resident permit to carry." \[Vox,

-   **Legislation Also Requires The DoJ To Study The Use Of Bump
    Stocks.** According to Vox, "The legislation also requires the
    Justice Department to study --- but not ban --- the use of bump
    stocks, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into machine gun-type
    weapons. (The Las Vegas gunman outfitted his gun with this device.)"

### Off-Duty And Retired Law Enforcement

**2024: Fitzpatrick Was Absent During A Vote On Allowing Off-Duty And
Retired Law Enforcement Officers To Carry Concealed Guns Across State
Lines And In School Zones, National Parks, And Public Transit And
Allowing States To Decrease Training Requirements For Retired
Officers.** In May 2024, Fitzpatrick missed a vote on, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would expand the authority for
qualified active and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed
handguns across state lines and into specified areas. It would allow
such officers (regardless of whether they are on or off-duty) to carry
concealed firearms and ammunition (including magazines) into school
zones, national parks, certain federal facilities open to the public
along with state, local or private property open to the public and onto
public modes of transportation (including land, rail and water
transportation --- but not commercial aircraft). It also would allow
states to extend, from between 12 to 36 months, the frequency with which
retired law enforcement officers must meet certain training
certifications." The House passed the bill by a vote of 221 to 185.

### Violent Conviction Restrictions

**2017: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against Restricting A Proposed
Concealed Carry Reciprocity Bill From Applying To Those Who Have Been
Convicted Of A Violent Crime Within The Last Three Years If The State
Already Prohibited The Person From Doing So.** In December 2017,
Fitzpatrick effectively voted against an amendment that would have,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] a person who has
been convicted of a violent crime within the preceding three years from
possessing or carrying a concealed handgun in a state where that
conviction would otherwise prohibit that individual from doing so." The
underlying bill would have, also according to Congressional Quarterly,
"permit\[ted\] any individual authorized by their home state to carry a
concealed handgun to also carry that concealed weapon in any other state
that permits the carrying of concealed weapons." The vote was on a
motion to recommit. The House rejected the motion by a vote of 190 to
236. \[House Vote 662,
