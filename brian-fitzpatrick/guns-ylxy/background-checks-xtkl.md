# Background Checks

### Expansion

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Expansion Of Firearm Background
Checks, Which Would Require Most Firearm Purchasers To Undergo A
Background Check Using The National Instant Criminal Background Check
System.** In March 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for the Bipartisan Background
Checks Act of 2021 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"require most purchasers of firearms to undergo a background check
through the FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
Specifically, beginning 180 days after enactment, it would require any
individual seeking to transfer a firearm to first bring the firearm to a
licensed dealer. It would require the dealer to take possession of the
firearm, complete a background check on the transferee, and return the
firearm to its original owner if the transaction is denied." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 227-203. The
Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 75,

-   **H.R. 8 Would Close The "Gun Show Loophole" That Facilitates
    Firearm Sales To Felons, Domestic Abusers, Or Other Barred From
    Owning Firearms.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill
    would require background checks of sales between private
    individuals, with the actual checks to be conducted through the
    federal system at licensed gun dealers --- closing the so-called
    'gun show loophole' that Democrats say allows sales to felons,
    domestic abusers or others who are prohibited from owning firearms."

    [3/11/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6157580?31)\]

-   **Republicans Claimed New Background Check Requirements Would Not
    Prevent Illegal Attainment Of Firearms, But Would Instead Violate
    Second Amendment Rights Of Law Abiding Citizens.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans who opposed the bill in the
    House say it would hinder the Second Amendment rights of lawful gun
    owners while not doing much to prevent unlawful gun purchases."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/11/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6157580?31)\]

-   **The Bill Would Increase Federal Oversight Of Firearm Sales By
    Requiring Unlicensed And Private Sellers To Run Background Checks On
    Purchasers.** According to Vox, "The background checks bill would
    expand federal oversight of gun sales, requiring unlicensed and
    private sellers to conduct background checks." \[Vox,

-   **The Gun Show Loophole Currently Allows Unlicensed Sellers To Sell
    Without Conducting Background Checks, Including Online Purchases,
    Gun Show Sales, And Firearm Transfers Between Family And Friends.**
    According to Vox, "While gun sales between licensed sellers and
    buyers are contingent on the buyer's passage of a federal background
    check for red flags like a criminal record or a history of mental
    illness, unlicensed sellers, including online sales, gun shows, and
    sales between family members and friends, are currently under no
    obligation to request a background check." \[Vox,
    [3/11/21](https://www.vox.com/2021/3/11/22319705/universal-background-checks-house-thompson-murphy)\]

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Expansion Of Firearm Background
Checks, With The Exception Of Family Gifts, Temporary Use For Hunting,
Shooting Range, Pest Control, Death Or Bodily Harm Prevention, And
Transfers Between Law Enforcement Agents For Official Duties.** In March
2021, Fitzpatrick voted for the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021
which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill would make
a number of exceptions to the requirement, including for loans or gifts
between family members; temporary transfers for hunting, use on a
shooting range, or pest control by farmers; temporary transfers to
prevent imminent death or bodily harm, including self-harm; and
transfers to law enforcement personnel, private security professionals,
or members of the armed forces, if associated with official duties." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 227-203.

**2021: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against The Bipartisan Background
Checks Act Of 2021, Which Would Expand Firearm Background Checks.** In
March 2021, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for
the "Jordan, R-Ohio, motion to recommit the bill to the House Judiciary
Committee." The vote was on a motion to recommit. The House rejected the
motion by a vote of 207-217. \[House Vote 74,

**2021: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against The Bipartisan Background
Checks Act.** In March 2021, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted against the "adoption of the rule (H Res 188) that
would provide for House floor consideration of the Protecting the Right
to Organize Act (HR 842), the Bipartisan Background Checks Act (HR 8),
and the Enhanced Background Checks Act (HR 1446). The rule would provide
for up to one hour of debate on each of the three bills; provide for
automatic adoption of a Scott, D-Va., manager\'s amendment to HR 842;
and make in order floor consideration of 19 amendments to HR 842, eight
amendments to HR 8, and four amendments to HR 1446." The vote was on the
adoption of the rule. The House adopted the rule by a vote of 218-197.

Fitzpatrick voted against the "motion to order the previous question
(thus ending debate and possibility of amendment) on the rule (H Res

### Extending And Expanding Background Check Rules

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted To Extend The Time A Licensed Firearm Dealer
Must Wait For A Background From Three Business Days To Twenty Business
Days And Voted To Expand The Reasons For Failing A Background Check To
Include Additional Mental Issues.** In February 2019, Fitzpatrick voted
for the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "This bill requires a licensed gun dealer to
wait up to 20 business days, rather than just three, to hear from the
FBI regarding an individual\'s background check before being allowed to
complete the sale and transfer the firearm if no determination has been
made through the NICS system. An individual could petition the Justice
Department for the weapon after 10 days. The measure also expands the
categories of individuals who are prohibited from obtaining a firearm by
broadening the ban for those with mental issues." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 228 to 198. \[House Vote
103, [2/28/19](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll103.xml);
Congressional Quarterly,
[2/25/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5468813?14); Congressional Actions,
[H.R.
1112](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1112/all-actions)\]

-   **A Background Check Can Take Up To Three Business Days Before The
    Gun Is Allowed To Be Given To The Buyer, Even If The Background
    Check Is Not Done.** According to Vox, "Under federal law, the great
    majority of checks are completed with few problems. But a small few
    are deemed inconclusive, at which point the FBI can ask for three
    business days to complete a check. If the FBI doesn't complete those
    background checks within three business days --- maybe it can't get
    the right information in time, or maybe a report takes too long to
    fax to the FBI --- then the would-be buyer is allowed to purchase a
    gun despite not completing a background check. According to
    ThinkProgress, the FBI failed to complete background checks within
    three business days in about 3.59 percent of the more than 8.6
    million gun background checks in 2017. This percentage is slowly
    creeping up: It was 2.76 percent in 2014, 3.02 percent in 2015, and
    3.24 percent in 2016." \[Vox,
    [2/28/18](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/28/17060024/background-check-guns-charleston-loophole)\]

-   **The Charleston Shooter Got His Gun Because Of This Loophole Even
    Though He Should Have Been Denied A Gun Via A Background Check.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Under current law, although
    licensed gun dealers generally receive a response that a prospective
    buyer has passed or failed a background check within a few minutes,
    in less than 10% of cases federal examiners require additional time
    to complete the background check. But if the examiners do not get
    back to the dealer within the current three-business-day period, the
    dealer can decide to allow the sale to go through without the final
    result of the check. Just such a loophole allowed Dylann Roof, who
    in 2015 murdered nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist
    Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., to purchase a gun even though
    he was not legally allowed to possess a firearm due to drug charges.
    Simply put: providing the FBI with additional time to complete
    background checks will save lives." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/25/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5468813?14)\]

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted To Allow A Gun Dealer, Who Was Given
Notification That A Transfer Was Legal Within Three Business Days, To
Rely On That Information For 25 Days After The Transfer Becomes Legal.**
In February 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment that would have,
according to a summary of the amendment from H. Rept. 116-14,
"allow\[ed\] an FFL who has contacted NICS, and who was not notified
that the transfer is legally permissible within 3 business days of the
initial date of contact, to rely on information provided by NICS
respecting a transfer for 25 days after the transfer becomes legally
permissible." The underlying bill was a bill that closed the so-called
"Charleston Loophole." The House passed the amendment by a vote of 234
to 193. The House later passed the underlying bill. \[House Vote 101,

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require The FBI Report On The Number Of
Background Checks It Was Not Able To Finish Within 10 Days.** In
February 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment that would have,
according to a summary of the amendment from H. Rept. 116-14,
"require\[d\] the FBI to report on the number of petitions it was not
able to make a determination on within the 10-day period." The
underlying bill was a bill that closed the so-called "Charleston
Loophole." The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 282 to 144. The
House later passed the underlying bill. \[House Vote 100,

### Fix NICS

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For The \$1.3 Trillion FY 2018 Omnibus
Spending Deal Which Raised Spending By \$138 Billion Over FY 2017
Levels; Legislation Included The Fix NICS Act, Which Would Attempt To
Better The National Instant Criminal Background Check System.** In March
2018, Fitzpatrick voted for the FY 2018 Omnibus spending bill. According
to Congressional Quarterly, "Combined, the spending measures would
provide about \$1.3 trillion in discretionary spending, with \$1.2
trillion subject to discretionary spending caps, and \$78.1 billion
designated as Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The measure\'s
spending levels are consistent with the increased defense and
non-defense budget caps set by the two-year budget deal agreed to last
month. That agreement increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80 billion
and the non-defense cap by \$63 billion. Given that the previous caps
were set to reduce overall discretionary spending by \$5 billion, the
net increase provided by the omnibus is \$138 billion over the FY 2017
level." The vote was on the motion to concur in the Senate Amendment
with an Amendment. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the
bill, by a vote of 256 to 167. The Senate later agreed to the
legislation, sending it to the president, who signed it into law.

-   **Omnibus Included The Fix NICS Act, Which Required State Law
    Enforcement Report Criminal Records To The NICS.** According to Vox,
    "The omnibus includes a new law (the Fix NICS Act) that would
    increase enforcement of the federal law requiring state law
    enforcement agencies to report criminal records to the National
    Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), and give states
    more financial incentives to report records. It's just about the
    most modest thing that Congress could do on guns, but it's still
    sparked some conservative pushback; the Freedom Caucus wanted to
    pair it with a law requiring states to recognize each other's
    concealed carry permits." \[Vox,
    [3/23/18](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/22/17150062/omnibus-spending-bill-march-ryan-mcconnell-congress)\]

-   **Student Survivors Of The Parkland Shooting Helped Change The Gun
    Safety Conversation.** According to Vox, "The students of Marjory
    Stoneman Douglas High School are changing the rhetoric around school
    shootings and gun control, and have succeeded in keeping the tragedy
    in Parkland, Florida, in the news for much longer than the media's
    usual attention span. With the March for Our Lives and planned
    school walkouts, student activists hope to turn their vocal protest
    of gun violence into a sustained movement." \[Vox,

### Gun Show Loophole

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require Federal Background Checks On All
Gun Purchases, With An Exemption For Transfers Within Families.** On
February 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for the Bipartisan Background Checks
Act of 2019. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill expands
federal background check requirements to require virtually all
purchasers of firearms to undergo a background check through the
National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) --- in
particular individuals who purchase firearms from other individuals
through private transactions. Under the measure, the transfer of
firearms must be conducted through licensed gun dealers who would
perform the background check through the NICS. The measure exempts a
number a firearms transfers from the bill\'s background check
requirement, including transfers between family members." The vote was
on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 240 to 190. \[House

[H.R.

-   **Sales Between Private Individuals Must Be Done By A Licensed Gun
    Dealer.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "To conduct the
    background check, the measure requires private individuals seeking
    to sell or transfer a firearm to another private individual to visit
    a licensed firearms dealer --- with the licensed dealer to take
    possession of the firearm and run the necessary background check of
    the prospective buyer through the NICS as if conducting a background
    check for a firearm from its own inventory. If the transaction is
    denied because of the background check or for any other reason, the
    dealer must return the weapon to the original owner (without
    conducting any background check). Licensed firearm dealers would be
    permitted to charge a fee for conducting background checks and
    processing such private transactions --- but they could not be
    required to process such transactions and run the background
    checks." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/25/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5468813?14)\]

-   **Exemptions Of The Universal Background Check Requirement Include
    Transfers Between Family Members Or Temporary Transfers Due To
    Imminent Death Or Bodily Threat.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The following sales and transfers of firearms would not
    be subject to the bill's background check requirements: Sales or
    transfers involving law enforcement agencies or officers, armed
    private security professionals, or members of the U.S. Armed Forces
    to the extent the transaction is associated with official duties;
    Loans or bona fide gifts between family members, including between
    parents and children, grandparents and grandchildren, and aunts and
    uncles and nieces and nephews; Transfers to executors or
    administrators from an estate upon the death of an individual;
    Temporary transfers necessary to prevent imminent death or great
    bodily harm for as long as the threat exists; Fully automatic
    firearms legally owned and registered with the Treasury Department
    prior to May 19, 1986; and Temporary transfers if there is no reason
    to believe it will be used in a crime and will exclusively be used
    at a shooting range or gallery, or necessary for hunting, trapping,
    or fishing, so long as the weapon is in the presence of the owner."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/25/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5468813?14)\]

-   **Democrats Argue That No Other Industrialized Nation Experiences
    Gun Violence Akin To The United States And Someone Who Could Not
    Purchase A Gun That Requires A Background Check Should Not Be
    Allowed To Instead Purchase At A Gun Show Without A Passing A
    Background Check.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Supporters of the two bills argue that the shear increase in gun
    violence warrants greater federal action. The level of gun violence
    and especially mass murders, which the FBI defines as shootings
    where four or more victims are killed, have increased dramatically
    since 2011 with mass shootings now occurring once every 64 days on
    average. No other industrialized country comes close to suffering
    the level of gun violence seen in the United States. And the only
    major difference between U.S. and these other countries is the
    largely unchecked ability to purchase guns in America and the ease
    with which many people can easily skirt the nation\'s background
    check system." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/25/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5468813?14)\]

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require The NICS Tell ICE If An
Undocumented Immigrant Tries To Buy A Gun.** In February 2019,
Fitzpatrick effectively voted for an amendment that would have,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] that the National
Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) notify U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement when a background check for an individual
seeking to purchase a firearm finds that the individual is an
undocumented immigrant." The underlying legislation was the Bipartisan
Background Checks Act of 2019, which required universal background
checks for firearm purchases. The vote was on a motion to recommit. The
House agreed to the motion, thereby agreeing to the amendment, by a vote
of 220 to 209. The House later passed the underlying bill. \[House Vote

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted To Include Threats Of Sexual Assault, Dating
Partner Violence, Domestic Violence, Stalking, And Domestic Abuse To
Allow For A Temporary Transfer A Firearm Without Needing To Undergo A
Background Check.** In February 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment
that would have, according to a summary of the amendment from H. Rept.
116-14, "clarifies that 'great bodily harm' includes domestic violence,
dating partner violence, sexual assault, stalking, and domestic abuse."
The underlying legislation was the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of
2019, which required universal background checks for firearm purchases.
The House passed the amendment by a vote of 310 to 119. The House later
passed the underlying bill. \[House Vote 97,

would have, according to a summary of the amendment from H. Rept.
116-14, "allows the transfer of firearms to individuals who participate
in the TSA Pre-Check program of the Department of Homeland Security."
The underlying legislation was the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of

**2018: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted To Block Consideration Of
Legislation That Would Have Expanded Background Checks To Cover Gun
Show, Internet And Classified Sales.** In February 2018, Fitzpatrick
effectively voted to block legislation that would have, according to a
press release from Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Peter King (D-NY),
"expand\[ed\] the existing background check system to cover all
commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the
internet or in classified ads while providing reasonable exceptions for
family and friend transfers. \[...\] The legislation also supports the
Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners. It provides
reasonable exceptions for firearms transfers between family members,
friends, and hunting buddies. Under the bill, background checks would
continue to be conducted in the same manner as they have for more than
40 years. The bill also help strengthen the National Instant Criminal
Background Check System (NICS) by incentivizing states to improve
reporting of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill and by directing
future grant funds toward better record-sharing systems. The bill will
reduce federal funds to states that do not comply." The vote was on a
motion to table the appeal of the ruling of the chair. The House adopted

    people at a Charleston, S.C., church in 2015. The FBI said afterward
    that a background check examiner never saw the shooter's previous
    arrest report because the wrong arresting agency was listed in state
    criminal history records, and the gun dealer was legally permitted
    to complete the transaction after three days." \[AP News,
