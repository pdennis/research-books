### 2019 El Paso Shooting Memorial

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Designate A Memorial Honoring The Victims
Of The 2019 El Paso Shooting.** In March 2022, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that would
"designate the memorial honoring victims of the August 2019 shooting in
El Paso, Texas, located at 6900 Delta Drive in El Paso, as the 'El Paso
Community Healing Garden National Memorial.' It would specify that the
memorial would not be a unit of the National Park System and its
designation would not require or authorize federal funding." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 403-25. \[House
