# Coltsville National Historical Park

### Alterative Park Administration And Visitors Center

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Allow The National Park Service Find A New
Administration And Visitors Center At The Coltsville National Historical
Park.** In February 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that, according
to Congressional Quarterly, "allow\[ed\] the National Park Service to
select an alternate location for park administration and visitor
services at Coltsville National Historical Park in Connecticut,
rescinding a requirement that had identified a different site for such
purposes." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the
bill. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a
vote of 369 to 42. The bill was later signed into law. \[House Vote 102,
