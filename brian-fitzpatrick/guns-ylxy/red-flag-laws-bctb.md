### Extreme Risk Protection Order

Order Act of 2021, which would "allow a family or household member of an

court to issue an extreme risk protection order to prohibit an
individual from purchasing or possessing a firearm or ammunition, if the
court finds that such purchase or possession poses a risk of imminent
personal injury to the individual or others. It would require courts to
grant or deny a petition for a temporary order, valid for 14 days, on
its date of submission. It would require courts to hold a hearing on a
petition for a long-term order, valid for a renewable period of 180
days, within 72 hours of issuing a temporary order or 14 days after
submission of the petition. In evaluating a petition, it would require
courts to consider recent threats or acts of violence by the respondent,
recent acts of cruelty to animals and evidence of ongoing substance
abuse. It would also allow courts to consider a respondent's reckless
use or display of a firearm or history of violence or attempted
violence." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote
