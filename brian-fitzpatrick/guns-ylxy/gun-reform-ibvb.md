an individual to knowingly purchase or attempt to purchase a firearm for
the possession of a third party or to hire, solicit or otherwise
endeavor to persuade another individual to do so. It would specify that
the prohibition does not apply to bona fide gifts between family members
or purchases by the agent of a lawful business, for lawful use in the
business. It would require the Justice Department to ensure that its
firearm transaction record forms include a statement outlining penalties
that may be imposed for violating the prohibition. It would also make it
a federal criminal offense for an individual to sell or dispose of a
firearm or ammunition to a recipient they have reason to believe intends
to use them in violation of federal law or sell or dispose of them in
another state in violation of that state\'s law." The vote was on a
motion to retain the provision. The House retained the provision by a
vote of 226-197. \[House Vote 238,
