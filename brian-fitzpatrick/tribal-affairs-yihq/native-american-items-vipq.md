# Protecting Native American Cultural Items

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted For Providing An Annual \$3 Million Through FY
2027 To Protect Native American Cultural Items And Archaeological
Resources And Ensure Their Return.** In December 2021, Fitzpatrick voted
for the Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony Act of 2021 which would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "include various provisions to
prevent the trafficking of Native American cultural items and
archaeological resources and provide for their return. It would
authorize \$3 million annually through fiscal 2027 and require the
Interior Department to promulgate rules within one year of enactment to
carry out the bill\'s provisions. Specifically, it would increase the
maximum penalty for trafficking Native American human remains or
cultural items from five to 10 years imprisonment. It would prohibit the
export of Native American cultural items and archaeological resources,
punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment, and require such items to be
forfeited upon discovery and returned to the appropriate tribe. It would
establish an export certification system to authorize legal exportation
of prohibited items and require the Interior Department train U.S.
Customs and Border Protection personnel on identifying, handling, and
documenting such items. It would also require the Interior and State
departments to each designate a liaison to facilitate the voluntary
return of tangible cultural heritage and require the Interior Department
to establish an interagency working group and Native working group to
facilitate and advise on the return of illegally removed or trafficked
items." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of
364-57. \[House Vote 401,
