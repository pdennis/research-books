# Federal Recognition Of Lumbee Tribe

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Provide Federal Recognition Of The Lumbee
Tribe.** In December 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to
Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would provide
federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe in North Carolina, allowing the
tribe to receive funding from the Interior Department. It also would
permit the Interior Department to take land into a trust on the tribe's
behalf. It would repeal the 1956 Lumbee Act that denied tribal members
federal assistance based on their status as American Indians." The House
passed the bill by a vote of 311 to 96. \[House Vote 511,

Tribe of North Carolina, making the tribe eligible for services and
