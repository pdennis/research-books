# Probation Officers

### Authority To Arrest Third Parties

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Give Probation Officers The Authority To
Arrest Obstructing Third Parties.** In May 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for
legislation that would have, according to the Associated Press,
"expand\[ed\] the authority of federal probation officers to arrest
someone who obstructs them from performing their official duties.
Probation officers already have the authority to arrest probationers who
they believe have violated a condition of their release, but not third
parties who try to stop their work." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 229 to 177. The Senate took no substantive
action on the legislation. \[House Vote 268,
