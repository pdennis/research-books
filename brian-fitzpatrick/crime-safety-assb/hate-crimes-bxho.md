### COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted To Instruct The Justice Department To Expedite
The Review And Reports Of COVID-19 Hate Crimes, Develop Guidance For
Establishing An Online Hate Crime Reporting System For State And Local
Law Enforcement, And Expand Public Education Campaigns.** In May 2021,
Fitzpatrick voted for the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act of 2021 which would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "require the Justice Department to
designate an employee solely responsible for facilitating the expedited
review of hate crimes during and up to one year after the end of the
COVID-19 public health emergency. It would require the DOJ to issue
guidance for state and local law enforcement agencies on how to
establish online hate crime and incident reporting; collect data
disaggregated by protected characteristics; and expand public education
campaigns to raise awareness and reach victims of hate crimes." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 364-62 and was
sent to the President and subsequently became law. \[House Vote 145,

-   **The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Pushed For
    Legislation That Addressed The Federal Government's Shortcomings In
    Responding To Asian American Hate During The COVID-19 Pandemic.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The 364-62 vote on the bill
    (S. 937) followed a monthslong push spearheaded by the Congressional
    Asian Pacific American Caucus to address perceived shortfalls in the
    federal response to a spike in hate crimes directed at Asian
    Americans since the start of the pandemic." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [5/18/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6227379?2)\]

-   **According To Stop AAPI Hate, From March 2020 To March 2021 There
    Were "More Than 6,600 Incidents Of Verbal Attacks, Physical Assaults
    And Other Incidents Targeted Against Asian Americans.** " According
    to Congressional Quarterly, "The advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate has
    tracked more than 6,600 incidents of verbal attacks, physical
    assaults and other incidents targeted against Asian Americans from
    March 2020 to March 2021." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/18/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6227379?2)\]

-   **The Bill Authorized Justice Department Grants To Aid State And
    Local Law Enforcement With Implementing National Incident-Based
    Reporting System, Which Would Help With Hate Crime Reporting,
    Prevention, And Response, And States Would Have To Report
    Information To The Justice Department And Implement A Reporting
    Hotline.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "authorize new
    Justice Department grants to support activities by state and local
    law enforcement related to hate crime reporting, prevention, and
    response, including to implement the National Incident-Based
    Reporting system and to update policies and systems, train
    personnel, and engage in community outreach to address hate crimes.
    It would require state and local governments receiving funds to
    report certain information to the DOJ regarding hate crimes
    committed and related law enforcement activities. It would also
    require the DOJ to make grants to states to create state-run hate
    crime reporting hotlines that would direct individuals to local
    support services and law enforcement, if appropriate."

-   **The Bill Required Individuals Convicted Of Hate Crimes To Take
    Educational Classes Or Community Service On The Harmful Impacts Of
    Hate Crimes On Communities.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "allow courts to require that an individual convicted in relation to
    a hate crime and placed on supervised release undertake educational
    classes or community service related to the community harmed by the
    offense." \[Congressional Quarterly,
