### 2018

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For An FY 2019 Defense, Labor, HHS, Education
Conference Report Appropriations Bill And Continuing Resolution Which
Also Extended The Violence Against Women Act Through December 7, 2018.**
In September 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for an FY 2019 appropriations bill
and continuing resolution. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
agreement provides FY 2019 appropriations for two annual spending
measures --- Defense and Labor-HHS-Education --- as well as a continuing
resolution to keep all federal departments and agencies operating
through Dec. 7 if they don\'t have full-year appropriations enacted.
Together, the two spending bills provide a total of \$784.5 billion in
discretionary spending subject to budget caps, 63% of the \$1.244
trillion limit for FY 2019. It provides \$674.4 billion in net
discretionary funding for the Defense Department (\$19.8 billion more
than FY 2018 but \$1.1 billion less than requested), including \$606.5
billion in base discretionary funding (\$17.0 billion more than FY 2018)
and \$67.9 billion in OCO funding. For Labor-HHS-Education it provides
\$180 billion in discretionary spending, including \$178.1 billion
subject to budget caps and \$1.9 billion in program integrity funding
--- \$977 million more than comparable FY 2018 funding and \$10.7
billion more than requested." The vote was on passage. The House passed
the bill by a vote of 361 to 61. The president later signed the bill
into law. \[House Vote 405,

    programs and authorities of the Violence Against Women Act to give
    lawmakers time to enact a multiyear extension. Absent Congressional
    action, the law expires on Sept. 30, 2018." \[Congressional

### 2019

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted To Reauthorize The Violence Against Women
Act.** In February 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for legislation reauthorizing
VAWA. According to Congressional Quarterly, "This bill reauthorizes
through FY 2024 programs enacted under the Violence Against Women Act
(VAWA), and it modifies the programs to further help state and local
governments improve strategies to combat violent crimes against women
and to strengthen victim services. It makes it a crime for police
officers to sexually assault those under arrest; it increases prison
sentences for those who stalk minors and applies domestic violence
penalties against those who commit violence against a current or former
dating partner; it allows the victims of domestic violence to terminate
a housing lease without penalty and requires federal housing officials
to provide emergency transfers to different housing units if an
individual believes he or she is threatened with imminent harm or a
sexual assault recently occurred on the property; and it prohibits
individuals from begin denied unemployment benefits solely because they
lost or left their job due to domestic violence, sexual assault or other
harassment. The measure also expands existing prohibitions on the
ability of individuals to purchase firearms if they have been convicted
of domestic violence by including those who abused dating partners as
well as individuals subject to temporary court restraining orders, and
it allows certain VAWA grant monies to be used toward efforts to recover
and store firearms from individuals convicted of domestic violence." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the legislation by a vote of 263
to 158. \[House Vote 156,
