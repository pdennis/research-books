# Sentencing Reform

### Pretrial Programs

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For Legislation Requiring State And Local
Governments Submit Reports On Their Pretrial Programs, Including Prior
Convictions For The Defendants That Received Services.** In May 2018,
Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"require\[d\] state and local governments that receive Justice
Department grants for pretrial services to submit annually a report to
the attorney general that would include the names of defendants who
received services, their prior convictions where applicable, and the
amount of money that had been allocated for pretrial services. The bill
also state\[d\] that if a state or local government were to fail to
submit such a report, it could lose grant funding for the following
year." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of
221 to 197. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation.

-   **Democrats Worried That The Legislation Would Increase The Use Of
    Bail.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents of the
    bill, primarily Democrats, say it would not further transparency
    because the information required would be incomplete, and that it
    instead could be used to displace pretrial services programs in
    favor of requiring bail, which would disproportionately impact the
    poor and most vulnerable in society. They say it would also
    undermine the privacy rights of those who participate in pretrial
    service programs." \[Congressional Quarterly,
