# Community Violence Intervention

### Grant Program

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Award Grants To Local Governments Or
Non-Profits To Establish Coordinated Community Violence Intervention
Programs In High-Risk Communities.** In September 2022, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Break the Cycle of
Violence Act, which would "require the Health and Human Services
Department to award grants for local governments or nonprofits to
implement coordinated community violence intervention programs that
provide culturally competent, community-based violence intervention
services to communities that are at high risk of being victimized by or
engaging in community violence, and that incorporate evidence-informed
strategies, trauma-responsive care and activities to expand economic
opportunity. It would authorize a total of \$5 billion for the program
through fiscal 2029. Among other provisions, the bill would establish a
community violence intervention office and advisory committee within HHS
to oversee and provide advice and assistance related to the grant
program, as well as a National Community Violence Response Center to
develop a taxonomy to assess the maturity of community violence
infrastructure among grantees and provide technical assistance for
funded programs. It would specify that no more than 15 percent of grant
funding per year may go to local governments and permit the department
to award supplemental funds to grantees that have demonstrated progress
after at least two years. The bill would also authorize \$1.5 billion
for fiscal 2022, available through fiscal 2029, for the Labor Department
to award grants for year-round job training and workforce programs in
communities disproportionately affected by gun violence to connect
individuals of ages 16 through 24 who are not employed or enrolled in
education or training programs to in-demand occupations." The vote was
on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 223-206. The Senate
did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 453,
