**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Amendment That Would Direct The
Department Of Justice To Support Services Directed Towards Indigenous
Women When Addressing Reentry Planning And Services For Imprisoned
Women.** In March 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for en bloc amendments no.1
which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require the Justice
Department to include support services tailored to the needs of
Indigenous women in a plan addressing reentry planning and services for
incarcerated women." The vote was on the adoption of amendments. The
House adopted the amendments by a vote of 228-197. \[House Vote 83,
