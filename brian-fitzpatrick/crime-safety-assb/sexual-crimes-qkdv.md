### Keep Young Athletes Safe Act

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For The \$1.3 Trillion FY 2018 Omnibus
Spending Deal Which Raised Spending By \$138 Billion Over FY 2017
Levels; Bill Included The Keep Young Athletes Safe Act.** In March 2018,
Fitzpatrick voted for the FY 2018 Omnibus spending bill. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "Combined, the spending measures would provide
about \$1.3 trillion in discretionary spending, with \$1.2 trillion
subject to discretionary spending caps, and \$78.1 billion designated as
Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The measure\'s spending levels
are consistent with the increased defense and non-defense budget caps
set by the two-year budget deal agreed to last month. That agreement
increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80 billion and the non-defense
cap by \$63 billion. Given that the previous caps were set to reduce
overall discretionary spending by \$5 billion, the net increase provided
by the omnibus is \$138 billion over the FY 2017 level." The vote was on
the motion to concur in the Senate Amendment with an Amendment. The
House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 256
to 167. The Senate later agreed to the legislation, sending it to the
president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 127,

-   **Bill Authorized The DOJ To Give Grants To A Non-Profit Group To

    the Justice Department to issue grants to a nonprofit entity to
    support oversight of the U.S. Olympic Committee, individual sport
    national governing bodies and paralympic sports organizations, to
    safeguard amateur athletes against abuse --- including emotional,
    physical and sexual abuse in sports. Under the measure, \$2.5
    million a year through FY 2022 would be authorized for grants, and
    grant recipients must have expertise in preventing and investigating
    emotional, physical, and sexual abuse and have the capacity to
    oversee regular and random audits at the organizations being
    monitored. The grants could also be used to develop and test new
    training materials for emotional, physical, and sexual abuse
    prevention and identification, for staff and related salaries, and
    to oversee administration of random audits." \[Congressional

Which Included A Provision Making It A Crime For Police Officers To
Sexual Assault Those Under Arrest.** In February 2019, Fitzpatrick voted
for legislation reauthorizing VAWA. According to Congressional
Quarterly, "This bill reauthorizes through FY 2024 programs enacted
under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), and it modifies the
programs to further help state and local governments improve strategies
to combat violent crimes against women and to strengthen victim
services. It makes it a crime for police officers to sexually assault
those under arrest; it increases prison sentences for those who stalk
minors and applies domestic violence penalties against those who commit
violence against a current or former dating partner; it allows the
victims of domestic violence to terminate a housing lease without
penalty and requires federal housing officials to provide emergency
transfers to different housing units if an individual believes he or she
is threatened with imminent harm or a sexual assault recently occurred
on the property; and it prohibits individuals from begin denied
unemployment benefits solely because they lost or left their job due to
domestic violence, sexual assault or other harassment. The measure also
expands existing prohibitions on the ability of individuals to purchase
firearms if they have been convicted of domestic violence by including
those who abused dating partners as well as individuals subject to
temporary court restraining orders, and it allows certain VAWA grant
monies to be used toward efforts to recover and store firearms from
individuals convicted of domestic violence." The vote was on passage.
