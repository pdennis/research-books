# Sexual Assault And Offenses

### Assaults Against Transportation Workers

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Develop Policies And Procedures To Address
Sexual Assault And Harassment In Passenger Transportation.** In March
2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the
Stop Sexual Assault and Harassment in Transportation Act, which would
"require passenger transportation carriers, within 180 days of
enactment, to develop policies and procedures for addressing and
reporting sexual assault or harassment incidents that occur on their
vehicles." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote
of 339-85, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 90,

Congressional Actions, [H.R.
5706](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5706/actions)\]

-   **The Bill Would Make It Punishable By A Fine Up To \$35K For
    Assaulting Or Threatening To Assault A Transportation Employee While
    They Are Working.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Among
    other provisions, it would make the assault of or threat to assault
    a transportation employee while the employee is working punishable
    by a fine of up to \$35,000." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/30/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/90?12)\]

-   **The Bill Would Commission The Transportation Department To Enact A
    Program To Collect Information On Sexual Assault Or Harassment Cases
    On Transportation Carriers And Collaborate With The Justice
    Department To Create A Reporting Process For People Involved In
    Those Incidents.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "It would
    require the Transportation Department to establish a program to
    collect data on sexual assault or harassment incidents on
    transportation carrier vehicles and coordinate with the Justice
    Department to develop a streamlined reporting process for
    individuals involved in such incidents." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/30/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/90?12)\]

-   **The Bill Would Require Transportation Carriers To Develop
    Policies, Training, And Reporting Procedures For Sexual Assault And
    Harassment To Tackle An Increase Of Violence Against Transportation
    Workers.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Last week, the
    House passed a bill (HR 5706) 339-85 that would require all
    transportation modes to establish formal policies, training and
    reporting structures on sexual assault and harassment --- another
    effort to combat a reported rise in hostility against those who work
    in transportation." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [4/5/22](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6503462?14)\]

### College Campuses

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Amendment Requiring Higher Institutions
To Develop And Administer An Online Survey Regarding Domestic Violence
And Sexual Assault And Harassment On Campus.** In March 2021,
Fitzpatrick voted for en bloc amendments no.1 which would, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "require the Education Department to develop a
standardized online survey to be administered by higher education

dating violence, sexual assault, sexual harassment and stalking." The
vote was on the adoption of amendments. The House adopted the amendments
by a vote of 228-197. \[House Vote 83,

### Ending Forced Arbitration

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To End Forced Arbitration Agreements Of Sexual
Assault And Harassment, Which Would Allow Allegations To Be Heard In
Court.** In February 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted for the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault
and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021, which would "make predispute
arbitration agreements, which are common in workplace and consumer
contracts, invalid and unenforceable at the election of an individual
alleging sexual assault or harassment, thus allowing the allegations to
be heard in court. It would apply the same requirements to class action
suits alleging such conduct. It would specify that the applicability of
the bill\'s provisions to a dispute would be determined by the court,
not an arbitrator." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill
by a vote of 335-97. The bill was passed in the Senate and ultimately
became law. \[House Vote 33,
[2/7/22](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll033.xml); Congressional
Quarterly, [2/7/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/33?7); Congressional
Actions, [H.R.
4445](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4445/actions)\]

-   **The Bill Amended The Federal Arbitration Act To Facilitate Victims
    Of Sexual Assault And Harassment To Bring A Lawsuit To Court And Not
    Be Coerced Into Arbitration.** According to Forbes, "Compared to
    many other laws passed by Congress H.R. 4445 is pretty short and
    straightforward. Basically, it amends the Federal Arbitration Act to
    make it easier for victims of sexual assault and/or harassment to
    bring suit in court and not be forced to arbitrate their legal
    claims." \[Forbes,
    [2/16/22](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomspiggle/2022/02/16/congress-passes-new-law-ending-forced-arbitration-for-sexual-harassment-and-assault-claims/?sh=6838c5192289)\]

-   **The Bill Ensured That Victims Would Get To Decide Whether To
    Litigate Their Sexual Assault Or Harassment Legal Claims In Court Or
    Arbitration, Prohibiting Forced Arbitration "Even If They Previously
    Signed An Agreement Limiting Their Legal Remedies To Arbitration
    Only."** According to Forbes, "First, prospective plaintiffs, not
    the defendants, get to choose whether to litigate their sexual
    assault or harassment claims in court or through arbitration.
    Individuals are no longer forced to arbitration and have this right
    to choose even if they previously signed an agreement limiting their
    legal remedies to arbitration only." \[Forbes,
    [2/16/22](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomspiggle/2022/02/16/congress-passes-new-law-ending-forced-arbitration-for-sexual-harassment-and-assault-claims/?sh=6838c5192289)\]

-   **The Bill Provided That Individuals May Decide To Bring Suit As An
    Individual Or Class, Regardless If The Individual Previously "Waived
    Their Right To Collective Legal Action."** According to Forbes,
    "Second, individuals may choose to bring suit individually or as a
    class (through a class-action lawsuit). This right also exists
    regardless of whether the individual signed an agreement waiving
    their right to collective legal action." \[Forbes,
    [2/16/22](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomspiggle/2022/02/16/congress-passes-new-law-ending-forced-arbitration-for-sexual-harassment-and-assault-claims/?sh=6838c5192289)\]

-   **The Bill Applied To A Case To Be Decided Under Federal Law And By
    A Federal Judge, Not An Arbitrator.** According to Forbes, "Third,
    the applicability of H.R. 4445 to a given case is to be decided
    under federal law and by a federal judge, not an arbitrator."
    \[Forbes,
    [2/16/22](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomspiggle/2022/02/16/congress-passes-new-law-ending-forced-arbitration-for-sexual-harassment-and-assault-claims/?sh=6838c5192289)\]

-   **The Bill Voided Existing Forced Arbitration Clauses And Contracts,
    Regardless If They Were Signed Before The Bill Became Law, But Did
    Not Allow Forced Arbitration-Completed Cases To Be Reopened.**
    According to Forbes, "Fourth, this law would partially apply
    retroactively. What this means is that any existing forced
    arbitration clauses or contracts are now voidable, even if the
    individual signed the forced arbitration agreement before H.R. 4445
    officially becomes law. However, prior cases that have already been
    completed through forced arbitration cannot be reopened and
    litigated in court." \[Forbes,
    [2/16/22](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomspiggle/2022/02/16/congress-passes-new-law-ending-forced-arbitration-for-sexual-harassment-and-assault-claims/?sh=6838c5192289)\]

-   **The Bill Extended Beyond Employment Contexts, Expanding To
    Clients, Customers, Patients And Customers.** According to Forbes,
    "Fifth, H.R. 4445 isn't just limited to the employment context. In
    addition to employees, other people potentially affected by this law
    include clients, customers, patients and consumers. This is because
    many consumer services, like property leases, ridesharing apps, home
    improvement contracts and so on, often require the consumer to sign
    a contract forcing them to arbitrate any legal claims concerning
    sexual harassment or assault (instead of going to court)." \[Forbes,
    [2/16/22](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomspiggle/2022/02/16/congress-passes-new-law-ending-forced-arbitration-for-sexual-harassment-and-assault-claims/?sh=6838c5192289)\]

-   **The Bill Forced Companies To Put Greater Effort In Addressing
    Claims Of Sexual Assault And Harassment.** According to Forbes,
    "This new law is more than just giving victims of sexual harassment
    and assault 'their day in court.' It's also about forcing companies
    to put more effort into addressing sexual assault or harassment
    claims." \[Forbes,
    [2/16/22](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomspiggle/2022/02/16/congress-passes-new-law-ending-forced-arbitration-for-sexual-harassment-and-assault-claims/?sh=6838c5192289)\]

-   **The Bill Aimed To Encourage Companies To Prevent Sexual Assault
    And Harassment Due To The Risk Of Sexual Misconduct Allegations
    Becoming Public Lawsuits.** According to Forbes, "Now that companies
    know it's far more likely allegations of sexual misconduct could
    result in a public lawsuit, they will try harder to prevent it from
    happening in the first place. It's true that arbitration isn't
    always confidential. However, it's usually easier for a
    company-defendant to keep what goes on during arbitration private
    compared to a conventional civil suit in state or federal court."
    \[Forbes,
    [2/16/22](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomspiggle/2022/02/16/congress-passes-new-law-ending-forced-arbitration-for-sexual-harassment-and-assault-claims/?sh=6838c5192289)\]

**2022: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against The Ending Forced
Arbitration Of Sexual Assault And Sexual Harassment Act Of 2021.** In
February 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted
against the "adoption of the rule (H Res 900) that would provide for
House floor consideration of \[...\] a bill (HR 4445) to restrict forced
arbitration with respect to sexual assault and harassment disputes." The
vote was on the adoption of the rule. The House adopted the rule by a
vote of 219-203. \[House Vote 17,

and possibility of amendment) on the rule (H Res 900) that would provide

forced arbitration with respect to sexual assault and harassment
disputes." The vote was on a motion to order the previous question. The

vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 244-172. The
