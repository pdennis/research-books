# Opioid Epidemic

### Border Patrol Accidental Opioid Exposure Prevention

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require U.S. Customs And Border Protection
To Provide Their Personnel Access To Containment Devices To Prevent
Secondary Exposure Of Fentanyl And Other Synthetic Opioids.** In July
2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the
Prevent Exposure to Narcotics and Toxics Act of 2021, which would
"require U.S. Customs and Border Protection to ensure that all personnel
at risk of accidental exposure to synthetic opioids have access to
containment devices to prevent secondary exposure to fentanyl and other
potentially lethal substances. It would also require the CBP to mandate
recurrent training on how to use the devices." The vote was on passage.
The House passed the bill by a vote 429-0, thus the bill was sent to the
Senate. \[House Vote 306,
