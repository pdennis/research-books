# Sex Trafficking

### Recognition Of Hardship

**2021: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against An Amendment That Would
Congressionally Recognize The Hardships Sex Trafficking Victims Have
Endured And Recognize The Importance Of Recovery For Sex Trafficking
Victims.** In March 2021, Fitzpatrick effectively voted against the
manager's amendment to the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act
which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "express the sense of
Congress that sex trafficking victims experience sexual violence and
assault and that federal recognition of their recovery is important."
The vote was on the adoption of the rule. The House adopted the rule by
a vote of 216-204, thus automatically adopting the manager's amendment.
