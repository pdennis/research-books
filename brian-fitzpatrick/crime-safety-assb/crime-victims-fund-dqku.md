# Crime Victims Fund

### Expansion Of Funds

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted To Direct The Justice Department Crime Victims
Fund To Expand And Include Funds From Deferred Prosecution And
Non-Prosecution Agreements.** In March 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for the
VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act of 2021 which would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "expand funding sources for the
Justice Department Crime Victims Fund to include funds from deferred
prosecution agreements and non-prosecution agreements." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 384-38, sent to the
Senate and President, and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 89,
[3/17/21](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll089.xml); Congressional
Quarterly, [3/17/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/89?6);
Congressional Actions, [H.R.
1652](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1652/actions)\]

-   **As Funds From Criminal Cases Have Decreased, H.R. 1652 Moved Money
    From Out-Of-Court Settlements Into The Crime Victims Fund.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "money from criminal cases has
    been on the decline in recent years, as out-of-court settlements
    become increasingly common. The new legislation (HR 1652) would
    funnel money from those settlements, which currently goes into
    general revenue, into the Crime Victims Fund instead."

-   **According To The Congressional Budget Office, Expanding
    Out-Of-Court Settlements Would Increase Spending To \$7.5 Billion
    Over A Decade For Victims Of Crime Act Programs.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Tapping into out-of-court settlements
    would result in enough new money coming into the fund to boost
    spending on mandatory Victims of Crime Act programs by \$7.5 billion
    over a decade, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated."

-   **The Bill Increased State Compensation By 15% To States For Victim
    Compensation Programs And Barred A Requirement Of Deducting Recovery
    Costs Or Restitution Collections When Determining The Awarded
    Funds.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "increase from 60% to
    75% the amount of grant funding provided to states for victim
    compensation programs and prohibit the department from requiring
    such programs to deduct recovery costs or restitution collections
    when calculating funds awarded." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/17/21](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2021/H/89?6)\]

-   **The Bill Provided Authorization To States To Waive A Fund Matching
    Requirement During And One Year After The Pandemic, Or If The State
    Establishes A Request And Receive Waiver Policy.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "authorize states to waive a fund matching
    requirement for grant recipients during and for one year after the
    end of a pandemic-related national emergency, or if the state
    establishes a policy for programs to request and receive a waiver."
