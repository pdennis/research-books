### Money Laundering

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Anti-Money Laundering Bill.** In
October 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that would, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "require each corporation and limited liability
company to file a report with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
detailing identifiable information on its beneficial owners and require
that such reports be updated annually. It would exempt from such
reporting requirements certain corporate entities subject to existing
disclosure laws or any company with more than 20 employees or over \$5
million in annual revenue. Among other provisions, it would establish
procedures for the disclosure of ownership information by FinCEN to law
enforcement agencies and establish civil and criminal penalties for
violations of the bill\'s reporting requirement." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 249-173. The bill was
never taken up by the Senate. \[House Vote 577,

-   **The Bill Was Meant To Curb The Use Of Shell Companies To Hide
    Assets From Criminal Investigators And Tax Officials.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The anti-money laundering bill \[...\]
    would require corporations and limited liability companies to report
    beneficial ownership information to the Treasury Department's
    Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, with a goal of curbing the use
    of anonymous shell companies that hide assets from criminal
    investigators and tax officials." \[Congressional Quarterly,
