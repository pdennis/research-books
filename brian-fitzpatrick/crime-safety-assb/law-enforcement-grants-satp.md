# Law Enforcement Grants

### COPS

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For The \$1.3 Trillion FY 2018 Omnibus
Spending Deal Which Raised Spending By \$138 Billion Over FY 2017
Levels, Including \$2.4 Billion In Grants For State And Local Law
Enforcement.** In March 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for the FY 2018 Omnibus
spending bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Combined, the
spending measures would provide about \$1.3 trillion in discretionary
spending, with \$1.2 trillion subject to discretionary spending caps,
and \$78.1 billion designated as Overseas Contingency Operations funds.
The measure\'s spending levels are consistent with the increased defense
and non-defense budget caps set by the two-year budget deal agreed to
last month. That agreement increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80
billion and the non-defense cap by \$63 billion. Given that the previous
caps were set to reduce overall discretionary spending by \$5 billion,
the net increase provided by the omnibus is \$138 billion over the FY
2017 level." The vote was on the motion to concur in the Senate
Amendment with an Amendment. The House agreed to the motion, thereby
passing the bill, by a vote of 256 to 167. The Senate later agreed to
the legislation, sending it to the president, who signed it into law.

    information sharing activities, \$8 million to assist states with
