### Condemning QAnon

**2020: Fitzpatrick Voted To Condemn QAnon And The Conspiracy Theories
It Promotes And Condemn All Far-Right And Far-Left Organizations And
Ideologies That Contribute To Conspiracies And Promote Destruction And
Violence Against Law Enforcement.** In October 2020, Fitzpatrick voted
for a resolution that would, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"express that the House of Representatives condemns QAnon and the
conspiracy theories it promotes, which baselessly allege that a group of
Satan-worshipping pedophiles in various positions of power are operating
a child sex trafficking ring and seeking to undermine President Donald
Trump. It would condemn all other groups and ideologies 'from the far
left to the far right' that contribute to the spread of conspiracy
theories and encourage destruction of property or attacks on law
enforcement officers. It would encourage the FBI to strengthen their
focus on preventing violence and harassment by such theories. It would
encourage the intelligence community to uncover any foreign support or
efforts to amplify QAnon online. It would urge Americans to seek
information from 'authoritative sources' and 'engage in political debate
from a common factual foundation.'" The vote was on passage. The House
passed the resolution by a vote of 371-18. \[House Vote 218,
