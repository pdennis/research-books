### Pregnant Prisoner Health

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require The Bureau Of Prisons To Address
The Health And Safety Needs Of Imprisoned Pregnant Women, Including
Prenatal Education And Birth Support Services, Screening And Adequate
Health Care For High-Risk Pregnancies, And Prohibiting Restrictive
Housing.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted for the Pregnant Women in Custody Act, which would
"add requirements for the Bureau of Prisons to provide services to
address the health and safety needs of incarcerated women related to
pregnancy and childbirth. It would require the BOP to provide a summary
of health- and safety-appropriate protocols to pregnant women when the
pregnancy is confirmed, including an assessment of changes relating to
bedding, water and bathroom access, diet, recreational activities and
transportation; provide pregnant women with prenatal education,
counseling and birth support services within 14 days of notification of
the pregnancy; and provide screening and adequate health care for
high-risk pregnancies, including elective transfer to a residential
reentry center during and after the pregnancy. The bill would prohibit
the use of restrive housing, which includes removal from the general
inmate population and placement in a locked room or cell, for pregnant
women through 12 weeks after delivery, unless a senior BOP official that
oversees women's health determines that it is required as a temporary
measure for the woman's medical safety. In the case of exceptions, it
would require officials to report on the placement and develop a plan to
move the individual to less restrictive housing. It would also prohibit
the use of solitary confinement in the third trimester. It would require
the BOP and the U.S. Marshals Service to establish a process for
incarcerated individuals to report a violation of this section. Among
other provisions, the bill would require the BOP to provide women of a
reproductive age access to contraception and testing for pregnancy and
sexually transmitted diseases; require the Justice Department to issue
rules for federal prisons to provide services for unexpected childbirth
deliveries and medical complications if a woman is unable to access a
hospital in a timely manner; and require biannual training for prison
employees to carry out the bill's requirements." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 324-90. The Senate did
not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 493,

-   **The Bill Would Have Required The Bureau Of Prisons To Provide
    Women With Contraception And Testing For STDs And Pregnancy,
    Instructed The Justice Department To Issue Rules For Unexpected
    Childbirth Deliveries In Federal Prisons, And Required Training For
    Prison Workers.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Among other
    provisions, the bill would require the BOP to provide women of a
    reproductive age access to contraception and testing for pregnancy
    and sexually transmitted diseases; require the Justice Department to
    issue rules for federal prisons to provide services for unexpected
    childbirth deliveries and medical complications if a woman is unable
    to access a hospital in a timely manner; and require biannual
    training for prison employees to carry out the bill's requirements."
