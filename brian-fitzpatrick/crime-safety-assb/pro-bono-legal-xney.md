# Pro Bono Legal Services

### Domestic Violence And Sexual Assault Victims

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Permanently Extend The Requirement For
Federal Judicial Districts To Host At Least One Yearly Event That
Promotes Pro Bono Legal Services For Domestic Violence And Sexual
Assault Victims.** In December 2022, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Pro bono Work to Empower and
Represent Act of 2021, which would "remove the sunset period to
permanently extend provisions in current law that require each federal
judicial district to host at least one annual event that promotes pro
bono legal services to empower survivors of domestic violence and sexual
assault and engage citizens in assisting survivors." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 406-14, thus the bill
was sent to President Biden and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote
