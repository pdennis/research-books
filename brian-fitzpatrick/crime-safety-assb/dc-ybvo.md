### Disapproval Of Criminal Code Adjustments

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted To Disapprove D.C.'s January 2023 Ordinance
That Would Allow Reform D.C.'s Criminal Code Starting In 2025, Which
Included Eliminating Most Mandatory Minimum Sentences, Expanding Jury
Trials For Misdemeanors, And Lowering Maximum Penalties For Certain
Crimes.** In February 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted for a resolution that would "establish congressional
disapproval of, effectively repealing, the January 2023 District of
Columbia Council legislation that would overhaul D.C.'s criminal code
effective October 2025. Among other provisions, the overhaul would
eliminate most mandatory minimum sentences, require jury trials for
misdemeanor offenses and reduce maximum penalties for certain crimes."
The vote was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of
250 to 173, thus the resolution was sent to the Senate. The Senate
passed the resolution, sent it to President Biden, and signed it in law,
effectively repealing the D.C. law. \[House Vote 119,

-   **D.C. Mayor Bowser Vetoed The D.C. Law, Claiming The Reductions To
    The Maximum Penalties Sent "The Wrong Message" On Crime Prevention
    And Opposing The Jury Trials For Misdemeanors Because They Could
    Overwhelm The Local Justice System.** According to the Associated
    Press, "The debate has put D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser in a curious
    political position. Bowser vetoed the rewrite of the city's criminal
    code in January, saying the maximum penalty reductions send 'the
    wrong message' on crime prevention, Bowser also apposed a measure
    that would allow for jury trials in most misdemeanor cases, saying
    the sudden spike in jury trials would overwhelm the local justice
    system." \[Associated Press,

    D.C. Council.** According to the Associated Press, "Her veto was

-   **Republicans Claimed D.C.'s City Council Was Soft On Crime During A
    Multi-Year Violent Crime Spike.** According to the Associated Press,
    "Republican lawmakers decried the D.C. government as soft on
    criminals in the midst of a multi-year local spike in violent crime.
    Several Republican lawmakers have cited Bowser's opposition to
    bolster their own arguments." \[Associated Press,

-   **The Criminal Code Overhaul Was Approved Unanimously By The D.C.
    Council And Supported By Major Stakeholders, Including D.C. Attorney
    General Brian Schwalb.** According to the Associated Press, "The
    sweeping rewrite of D.C's criminal code has been years in the
    making; it was approved unanimously last year by the 13-member D.C.
    Council and carries the support of major stakeholders, including
    D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb." \[Associated Press,

-   **The Criminal Law Reformed D.C.'s Criminal Code For The First Time
    Since 1902, Including By Lowering Sentences And Expanding The
    Ability For Jury Trials In Misdemeanor Cases.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The criminal bill would overhaul D.C.'s
    criminal statute for the first time since 1901, including by
    reducing sentences and expanding the right to a jury trial for
    misdemeanor cases. The D.C. Council advanced the bill in November."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/9/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7661305?5)\]

-   **The D.C. Police Union Opposed D.C.'s Criminal Code Reform,
    Claiming That Violent Crime Rates Would Continue To Increase.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "But the legislation, which
    would take effect in 2025, earned pushback from law enforcement. The
    D.C. Police Union said in a statement that the bill 'will lead to
    violent crime rates exploding even more than they already have.' And
    in January, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser vetoed it, writing in a
    letter that she had 'very significant concerns' about some of the
    bill's proposals." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/9/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7661305?5)\]

    Invasions.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Bowser
    specifically cited provisions that would reduce penalties for
    criminal offenses related to firearm possession as well as for
    robberies, burglaries and home invasions." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [2/9/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7661305?5)\]

-   **Senator Elizabeth Warren Argued That The Criminal Code Overhaul
    Brought D.C. Code Into The "Middle Of Most States, Red And Blue,"
    And Emphasized That D.C. Citizens Should Have The Right To Elect
    Local Representatives To Determine Their Own Criminal Laws.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Other Senate Democrats,
    however, have stood by the D.C. Council. Sen. Elizabeth Warren,
    D-Mass., said she opposes the resolution because the criminal code
    revisions bring the D.C. code 'into line with the middle of most
    states, red and blue.' 'But even more importantly, D.C. citizens
    should be accorded the same right to pick their elected
    representatives and have those representatives determine the
    criminal laws, the same way as every other state in the union,'
    Warren said." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/8/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7681968?10)\]

-   **One Of The Controversial Provisions Of The D.C. Criminal Code
    Reform Would Reduce The Maximum Penalty For Offenses Such As Armed
    Carjacking From 40 Years To 24 Years.** According to NPR, "At issue
    in what was a sweeping but otherwise noncontroversial effort to
    overhaul D.C.'s criminal statutes are provisions to reduce the
    maximum penalties for crimes like armed carjacking from 40 years
    down to 24, which supporters argue is in line with the actual
    sentences handed down in court in recent years." \[NPR,

-   **Many Criticized The Expansion Of Jury Trials Fro Certain
    Misdemeanors, Arguing It Would Overload The D.C. Court System And
    Lead To Prosecutors Dropping Cases.** According to NPR, "There was
    also objection to a provision to expanding the right to jury trials
    for certain criminal misdemeanor offenses, which critics say would
    overload a taxed D.C. court system and result in prosecutors
    dropping more cases." \[NPR,

-   **Senator Ben Cardin Emphasized That The Criminal Code Overhaul
    Would Increase Penalties For Gun Crimes.** According to NPR, "The
    split frustrated Democrats like Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, who voted
    against the GOP resolution. He said lost in the debate was that the
    revised code would also enhance penalties for gun crimes --- a major
    Democratic priority." \[NPR,

### Policing Reform

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted To Override President Biden's Veto And
Disapprove D.C. Legislation That Would Codify Accountability Measures
And Restrictions On Policing In D.C.** In June 2023, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted to override President Biden's
veto on a resolution that would "establish congressional disapproval of,
effectively repealing, the January 2023 District of Columbia Council
legislation that would codify or establish accountability measures and
restrictions on policing in the district. Among other provisions, the
D.C. law would establish a board to review the D.C. Metropolitan Police
Department's use of force; expand officer training requirements;
prohibit the hiring of officers with a history of serious misconduct;
ban the use of neck restraints by officers; restrict MPD purchases of
military-grade equipment; and establish new procedures to expand access
to body-worn camera footage and police disciplinary records." The vote
was on a veto override. The House failed to acquire a 2/3 majority vote
and rejected the motion by a vote of 233 to 197, thus the veto was
sustained. \[House Vote 253,

-   **The D.C. Bill Banned Police Chokeholds, Raised Public Access To
    Police Cameras, And Mandated De-Escalated Techniques, Which All
    Mirrored A Similar Biden Executive Order.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "D.C.\'s measure bans police chokeholds,
    increases public access to police body cameras and requires that
    police use de-escalation techniques. It largely mirrors an executive
    order from the Biden administration that set similar rules for
    federal law enforcement." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/13/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7768497?23)\]

    Was Part Of A "Soft On Crime" Agenda, Democrats Contended The Law
    Needed A Policing Overhaul.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Republicans have argued the law overly restricts police and is part
    of a 'soft on crime' agenda among Democrats. Democrats, meanwhile,
    have argued the law represents needed policing reforms"

    Requirements, Barred Hiring Officers With A Misconduct History, And
    Sought To Enhance Police Accountability And Transparency.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "D.C. officials and House
    Democrats contend the law increases public safety, as it strengthens
    training requirements, prohibits hiring police who have a history of
    misconduct, and aims to bolster police accountability and
    transparency." \[Congressional Quarterly,

    Performing Their Duties And Made Officer Retention Difficult.**

    makes officer retention difficult at a time when carjacking rates
    grab headlines in D.C." \[Congressional Quarterly,
