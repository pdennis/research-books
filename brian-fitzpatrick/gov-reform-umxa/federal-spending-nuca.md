### Spending At Trump Organization Hotels

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Prohibiting The Defense Department
From Spending Money At Hotels And Golf Resorts Affiliated With The Trump
Organization.** In July 2019, Fitzpatrick voted against an amendment to
the House FY 2020 NDAA that would, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"prohibit the use of funds authorized by the bill for the Defense
Department to reimburse certain expenses at properties owned by or
connected to President Donald Trump or his businesses. It would allow
the president to waive the limitation if he reimburses the Treasury
Department for the associated expenses." The vote was on adoption. The
House adopted the amendment by a vote of 223-205. \[House Vote 457,

-   **Democrats Rebuked The Trump Administration For Spending Taxpayers
    Money At Organizations Affiliated With The Trump Organization.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The \[state\] department
    since 2017 has paid nearly \$80,000 to properties owned, managed or
    branded by the president's private company, The Trump Organization,
    according to data tabulated by the investigative news site
    ProPublica. The tab for American taxpayers includes a nearly
    \$11,000 payment to the president's golf club in Doonbeg, Ireland.
    ProPublica said it was not clear when that specific payment was
    made." \[Congressional Quarterly,
