    for an unauthorized meeting in the Oval Office, and even though
    Clark assured DOJ officials that he would not meet with the
    president again, 'Clark brazenly violated the policy at least once
    more,' the report states." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [10/7/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6360702?1)\]

-   **The Judiciary Report Found That The Trump Administration's White
    House Chief Of Staff Mark Meadows Violated The Communications

    Department And White House Contact Policies Because The Attorney
    General Does Not Have The Authority To Remove A Senate-Confirmed
    Justice Department Official Who Violates Such Policies.** According
    to Congressional Quarterly, "Attorney General Merrick B. Garland and
    White House Counsel Dana Remus updated and reissued DOJ and White
    House versions of the contact policies in July. But the report
    concludes that a stricter oversight regime is needed, particularly
    because an attorney general does not have the authority to fire a
    Senate-confirmed DOJ official who violates it." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [10/7/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6360702?1)\]
