# District Of Columbia

### Budget Autonomy

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Washington, D.C.'s Budget Autonomy.**
In September 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against an amendment that would
have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "eliminate\[d\] the bill's
repeal of the District of Columbia's budget autonomy." The underlying
legislation was an FY 2018 omnibus. The House rejected the amendment by
a vote of 186 to 222. The House later passed the underlying legislation.
The Senate took no substantive action on the overall legislation.
