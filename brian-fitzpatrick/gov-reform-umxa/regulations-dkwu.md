# Regulations

### Congressional Disapproval

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Allow Congress To Disapprove Regulations
Made In A Presidents Final Year Via The Congressional Review Act En
Bloc.** In November 2016, Fitzpatrick voted for legislation that would
have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "permit\[ed\] a new Congress
to use the procedures under the Congressional Review Act to disapprove
en bloc multiple regulations issued during the final year of a
president's term." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by
a vote of 238 to 184. The Senate took no substantive action on the
legislation. \[House Vote 8,

### Overturning Supreme Court Precedent On Agency Deferral

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Repeal Supreme Court Precedent That
Deferred To Agency Interpretation Of The Underlying Law As Part Of
Legislation That Made Significant Changes To Federal Rule-Making.** In
January 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for legislation that altered the
procedure for federal rule-making. According to Congressional Quarterly,
"Passage of the bill that would modify the federal rule-making process,
including by codifying requirements for agencies to consider costs and
benefits of alternatives. The bill would create additional steps that
agencies would need to follow when planning 'major' rules with annual
costs of more than \$100 million or 'high-impact' rules with annual
costs of more than \$1 billion. For example, agencies would need to hold
an advanced-notice comment period prior to proposing such rules to
determine whether to continue the rule-making process. The measure would
postpone the effective dates of 'high impact' rules until any lawsuits
filed within 60 days of the rule's publication in the Federal Register
are resolved. It would effectively overturn two Supreme Court decisions
that require federal courts to defer to an agency's interpretation of
the underlying law or rule when considering legal challenges to rules.
It would also require agencies to evaluate the 'indirect' impacts of
proposed rules on small businesses." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 238 to 183. The Senate took no substantive
action on the legislation. \[House Vote 45,

### Postponing Enactment Of Regulations With At Least \$1 Billion Of Impact Until All Legal Challenges Filed Within 60 Days Of Publication Are Resolved

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Postpone Enactment Of Regulations With At
Least \$1 Billion Of Impact Until All Legal Challenges Filed Within 60
Days Of Publication Are Resolved As Part Of Legislation That Made
Significant Changes To Federal Rule-Making.** In January 2017,
Fitzpatrick voted for legislation that altered the procedure for federal

### Regulations, Generally

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Creating A "Regulatory
Budget."** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a budget
resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It
would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1
trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at
\$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas
Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and
would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense
account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and
would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into
a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs,
such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was
an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC
budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555,

-   **Legislation Would Call For The Creation Of A "Regulatory
    Budget."** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018
    Budget, "The RSC budget includes the Article I Regulatory Budget Act
    sponsored by RSC Chairman Mark Walker, to allow Congress to regain
    oversight and supremacy over the administrative state. A regulatory
    budget works similar to a fiscal budget. Under this proposal,
    Congress would establish annual caps on the costs executive branch
    agencies could impose on the economy through new regulations. Over
    time, as agencies seek to impose new regulations, they will be
    forced to repeal existing outdated and unnecessary rules, reducing
    the overall burden on the country. A regulatory budget could be tied
    to 'Legislative Impact Accounting', which would account for the
    regulatory costs of proposed legislation.88 Reviews of regulatory
    budgeting proposals show that they could save up to \$100 billion in
    costs imposed on the economy each year.89 More importantly,
    regulatory budgeting would change the way Washington works, helping
    to restore the proper balance of powers envisioned by the Framers
    and making government more accountable to the people it is supposed
    to serve." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed
    10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Prohibit Agencies From Publically
Supporting Or Opposing Pending Regulations.** In March 2017, Fitzpatrick
voted for the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017. According to
Congressional Quarterly, the legislation would have "require\[d\]
federal agencies to maintain and regularly update detailed online
databases of regulatory actions taken and pending before the agency.
Under the measure, an agency would \[have\] be\[en\] required to list
whether it is considering alternatives and whether it is accepting
comments. It would \[have\] explicitly prohibit\[ed\] agencies from
directly advocating support or opposition for pending regulatory actions
in public communications. As amended, the measure would \[have\]
require\[d\] an agency to list regulatory actions issued by the agency,
or any other agency, that would duplicate or overlap with the agency's
pending regulatory action." The vote was on passage. The House passed
the bill by a vote of 246 to 176. The Senate took no substantive action
on the legislation. \[House Vote 126,

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Create A Commission Tasked With Identifying
And Eliminating Government Regulations And Voted To Establish A System
Known As 'Cut-Go' Which Would Require Agencies To Repeal Regulations To
"Offset" New Rules.** In March 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for legislation
known as the SCRIB Act. The legislation would have, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "establish\[ed\] a nine-member commission to
review existing federal regulations and identify regulations that should
be repealed on the basis of reducing costs on the U.S. economy. The
commission would identify those regulatory policies that should be
repealed immediately, and would set up a 'Cut-Go' system that would
require agencies to repeal existing rules to offset costs before issuing
a new rule. The measure, as amended, would require the commission to
review a rule or regulation's unfunded mandate, whether the rule or
regulation limits or prevents government agencies from adopting
technology to improve efficiency, and the rule or regulation's impact on
wage growth, when determining if the rule or regulation should be
repealed." The vote was on passage. The House passed the legislation by
a vote of 240 to 185. The Senate took no substantive action on the
legislation. \[House Vote 114,

-   **The Nine Member Commission Would Be Tasked With Locating
    Regulations To Be Repealed Because Their Repeal Would Benefit The
    Economy.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Passage of the
    bill that would establish a nine-member commission to review
    existing federal regulations and identify regulations that should be
    repealed on the basis of reducing costs on the U.S. economy."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [1/7/16](http://www.cq.com/vote/2016/H/20?12)\]

-   **Commissioners Would Be Appointed By The President And Confirmed By
    The Senate; Eight Of Its Members Must Be From A List Given To The
    President By Congressional Leadership From Both Sides Of The
    Aisle.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The commission is to
    be composed of nine members appointed by the president and confirmed
    by the Senate. Under the measure, eight of those appointments must
    be from lists of possible nominees submitted by the speaker and
    minority leader of the House and the majority and minority leaders
    of the Senate (two from each list). The president would select and
    appoint the commission's chair, with this individual to be chosen
    from among past administrators of OMB's Office of Information and
    Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), the Administrative Conference of the
    United States or other individuals who have similar experience and
    expertise in rule-making and regulatory reviews. All appointments
    must be submitted to the Senate for confirmation within 180 days of
    enactment, and the commission could not hold any votes until all
    nine members of the commission are confirmed." \[Congressional
    Quarterly,
    [12/31/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4812983/3?18&search=EEuFY4IE)\]

-   **Bill Opponents Claim That The Bill Does Not Address An Existing
    Problem And Its 'Cut-Go' Procedure Would Hinder Agencies From
    Properly Performing Their Statutory Responsibilities.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents, including most Democrats, argue
    that the bill is a solution in search of a problem since there
    already exists an extensive framework for agencies to modify and
    repeal past regulations. The bill\'s premise, they say, is based on
    the false idea that federal agency rule-making somehow undermines
    economic growth and job creation. \[...\] They say the bill\'s new
    'cut-go' procedures are particularly egregious because they will
    inhibit agencies from doing their most basic functions by
    prohibiting a simple informal rule-making from taking place, even in
    the case of an emergency of threat to public health, until the
    agency offsets the costs of that new rule by repealing a rule
    identified by the commission." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [12/31/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4812983/3?18&search=EEuFY4IE)\]

-   **President Trump Has Called To Reduce Regulations.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "President Trump, meanwhile, has vowed to
    reduce regulations and has taken executive actions to impose a
    freeze on most pending regulations, as well as to require agencies
    to repeal two regulations for every new rule that is proposed. All
    agencies are required to set up a task force to identify outdated
    and costly rules, as well as those that hinder job creation, with
    those identified rules to be subject to possible repeal."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/24/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5049081/8?98)\]

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require The Commission Created By The SCRUB
Act, Which Would Require Agencies To Eliminate Old Rules In Order To
Create New Ones, To Consider Any Impact Of Public Health.** In February
2017, Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment that would have, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] the regulatory review commission,
in identifying which rules should be repealed, to consider the extent to
which repealing the rule would impact public health." The underlying
legislation, also according to Congressional Quarterly, "establish\[ed\]
a nine-member commission to review existing federal regulations and
identify regulations that should be repealed on the basis of reducing
costs on the U.S. economy. The commission would identify those
regulatory policies that should be repealed immediately, and would set
up a 'Cut-Go' system that would require agencies to repeal existing
rules to offset costs before issuing a new rule. The measure, as
amended, would require the commission to review a rule or regulation's
unfunded mandate, whether the rule or regulation limits or prevents
government agencies from adopting technology to improve efficiency, and
the rule or regulation's impact on wage growth, when determining if the
rule or regulation should be repealed." The vote was on the amendment.
The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 348 to 75. The House later
passed the SCRUB Act. The Senate took no substantive action on the
legislation. \[House Vote 105,

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Implementing The REINS Act.**
In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a budget resolution that
would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9

-   **Legislation Called For Implementing The REINS Act, Which Would
    Require Congressional Approval For Executive Agencies' "Major Rules"
    Before Their Implementation** According to the Republican Study
    Committee FY 2018 Budget, "The RSC regulatory reform plan would also
    incorporate H.R. 26, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of
    Scrutiny (REINS) Act, to require that Congress approve of any
    regulations that have an annual economic impact of \$100 million or
    more. As described by FreedomWorks, 'The REINS Act brings a crucial
    check on executive power, reduces the influence of federal
    regulatory agencies, and begins to reclaim Congress' constitutional
    power as the sole lawmaking authority under the Constitution.'"

**2015: Fitzpatrick Voted For Legislation That Would Require
Congressional Approval For Executive Agencies' "Major Rules" Before
Their Implementation.** In July 2015, Fitzpatrick voted for legislation
that required Congressional approval of executive agencies' proposals
categorized as "major rules." According to Congressional Quarterly, the
legislation would have required "Congress to approve all executive
agency regulatory proposals categorized as 'major rules' before their
implementation and would also create an expedited consideration process
for joint congressional resolutions of approval." The vote was on
passage of the legislation. The House approved the legislation 243 to
165. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House

-   **"Major Rules" Were Defined By The Legislation As "Regulations With
    An Annual Economic Impact Of More Than \$100 Million."** According
    to the Congressional Quarterly, "The measure defines the term 'major
    rule' as any rule that would have an annual economic effect greater
    than \$100 million; would cause a major increase in costs or prices;
    or would have a significant adverse effect on competition,
    employment, investment, productivity, innovation or U.S. economic
    competitiveness." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [12/30/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5010999/11?22)\]

-   **The Federal Government Issues 3,000 To 4,000 Rules A Year; About
    82 Rules Annually Over The Past Five Years That Would Be Considered
    Major Rules Under The REINS Act.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, " Federal agencies issue 3,000 to 4,000 final rules each
    year. Most of these are developed by the Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA) and the Transportation, Homeland Security and Commerce
    departments. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, on
    average, 82 proposed major rules, as defined by the bill, have been
    issued per year for the past six years." \[Congressional Quarterly,

    Legislation Amended The Congressional Review Act (1996) Which Has
    Been Largely Ineffective At Controlling Regulations From The
    Executive Branch.** According to the Hill, "The Judiciary
    Committee\'s report on the bill explains that back in 1996, the
    Congressional Review Act (CRA) was implemented as an attempt to get
    control over the large number of regulations coming from the federal
    government. But only one regulation has been undone using CRA, while
    60,000 regulations have come into being. Major regulations accounted
    for 1,000 of them." \[The Hill,

    the way Washington works for the better. It will help give Congress
    more oversight on spending, will make the executive branch more

-   **Obama Administration On Identical 2015 Bill: Legislation Was
    Unnecessary.** According to the Hill, "The controversial regulatory
    reform bill, which the House will vote on later this week, would
    give Congress the final say over all major regulations. 'This
    radical departure from the longstanding separation of powers between
    the executive and legislative branches would delay, and in many
    cases, thwart implementation of statutory mandates and executive of
    duly-enacted laws,' the White House wrote. \[...\] The White House
    said the REINS Act is unnecessary. 'This administration has already
    taken numerous steps to reduce regulatory costs and to ensure that
    all major regulations are designed to maximize net benefits to
    society,' the White House wrote." \[Hill,

    Representatives, "This is an extreme measure that would make it
    virtually impossible for agencies to issue any meaningful rules,
    threatening the health and safety of workers and the public. I urge
    you to vote against this legislation. \[...\] The REINS Act would
    cripple a regulatory process that already causes excessive delays in
    the issuance of crucial worker and public protections. For example,
    despite having unanimous support from industry and labor, the 2010
    Occupational Safety and Health Administration's construction safety
    standard on cranes and derricks took ten years to finalize. Under
    REINS, Congressional inaction could simply kill such commonsense
    rules. \[... The REINS Act represents a grave threat to our
    government's ability to protect workers and the public from harm."

    implementation of vital public health and environmental safeguards,
    which would mean more premature deaths, illnesses, and other health
    impacts on the American people at the hands of polluters dumping
    toxins into our air and water. The bill requires both houses of
    Congress to affirmatively approve all significant new public
    protections before they take effect. This is nothing more than a
    tool for polluters to scuttle new health and environmental
    safeguards." \[League of Conservation Votes,
