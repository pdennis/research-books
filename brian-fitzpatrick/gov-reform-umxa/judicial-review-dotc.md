### Agency Actions

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require Federal Courts To Decide Questions
Of Law Regarding Agency Actions Without Deferring To Such Agencies'
Precedence And Place Such Requirements On Judicial Review Of
Interpretation Of Constitutional And Statutory Provisions And Agency
Rules.** In June 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick
voted for the Separation of Powers Restoration Act of 2023, which would
"require federal courts to decide questions of law regarding agency
actions without deferring to an agency\'s previous legal determinations.
It would place such requirements on judicial review of interpretation of
constitutional and statutory provisions and other agency rules." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 220 to 211,
thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 271,

-   **The Bill Addressed The Decades-Old Legal Precedent, Chevron
    Deference, Which Courts Have Relied On To Uphold Agency Rules.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House has also indicated
    a possible floor vote soon on another bill (HR 288), which takes aim
    at a decades-old legal precedent known as the 'Chevron deference'
    that courts have relied on to uphold thousands of agency rules
    across the entire U.S. government." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/14/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7769383?8)\]

-   **The Chevron Deference Was Derived From The Chevron USA Inc. V.
    Natural Resources Defense Council Inc. (1984), Which The Court
    Determined That Judges Should Defer To The Agencies' Interpretations
    Of A Law.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "That doctrine
    stems from a 1984 Supreme Court case, Chevron USA Inc. v. Natural
    Resources Defense Council Inc., in which the court found that judges
    should defer to the agencies' interpretations of a law if it is
    ambiguous." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/14/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7769383?8)\]

-   **Republicans And The Conservative Legal Movement Criticized The
    Chevron Deference, Alleging It Allowed Agencies To Go Beyond
    Congressional Laws.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Republican lawmakers and the conservative legal movement have been
    critical of the doctrine for years, describing it as a way that
    regulatory agencies go beyond what Congress intended when it passed
    laws." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/14/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7769383?8)\]

-   **The Bill Would Essentially Overturn Two Supreme Court Rules That
    Mandated Courts To Provide Substantial Deference To An Agency's
    Interpretation Of The Law It Was Implementing And Their Own
    Regulation Interpretations.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "The legislation would effectively overturn two Supreme Court
    decisions that require courts to give substantial deference to a
    federal agency\'s interpretation of the law it is implementing, and
    to its own interpretation of regulations." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [6/15/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7769375?9)\]

-   **Republicans Claimed The Chevron Deference-Based Decisions Shifted
    The Balance Of Power Between Government Branches In Favor Of Federal
    Agencies, Allowing Them To Go Beyond Congressional Intent.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans argue those
    decisions shift the balance of power between the branches of
    government disproportionately in favor of regulatory agencies,
    giving them a way to go beyond what Congress intended when it passed
    laws." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/15/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7769375?9)\]

-   **Democrats Opposed The Bill Because It Would Override
    "Long-Standing, And Reasonable, Supreme Court Precedents."**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Democrats reject the measure,
    saying it overrides long-standing, and reasonable, Supreme Court
    precedents." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/15/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7769375?9)\]

-   **Far-Right House Republicans Organized To Vote Against The Rule As
    A Rebuke To GOP Leadership For The Passage Of The Bipartisan Debt
    Limit Package And For Backtracking On A Promise to Vote On Gun
    Rights Legislation.** According to Roll Call, "Hard-right House
    conservatives derailed legislation scheduled for floor votes Tuesday
    in a rebuke to GOP leadership. A group of House Republicans bucked
    their party to vote against a rule (H Res 463) devised by GOP
    leaders to take up legislation that included measures to rein in the
    federal regulatory process (HR 277, HR 288) and the Biden
    administration\'s ability to restrict gas stoves in particular (HR
    1615, HR 1640). The rule was defeated on a 206-220 vote, as 11 GOP
    defectors joined all Democrats in opposition. \[...\] The dissenting
    Republicans said the vote was intended to signal their frustration
    with GOP leadership for cutting a deal last week on the debt limit
    they opposed. They also said leaders backtracked on a pledge to
    schedule a floor vote on gun rights legislation (H J Res 44)."

-   **The Defeat Of The House Rule Was The First Defeat Since 2002.**
    According to Roll Call, "It was the first defeat of a House rule on
    the floor since 2002, according to C-SPAN\'s Howard Mortman. At that
    time, anti-abortion Republicans rebelled against bankruptcy overhaul
    legislation over language Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., helped
    author that would bar protesters at abortion clinics from declaring
    bankruptcy to avoid paying court-ordered fines and judgments."
