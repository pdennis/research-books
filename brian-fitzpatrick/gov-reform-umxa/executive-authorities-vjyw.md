# Executive Branch Authorities

### Weaponization Of The Federal Government Subcommittee

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted To Establish A House Select Subcommittee On
The Weaponization Of The Federal Government To Investigate Whether
Executive Branch Authorities Investigate And Collect Information On
American Citizens.** In January 2023, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for a resolution that would "establish a
Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government on
the House Judiciary Committee and require the subcommittee to conduct an
investigation of and submit a report on executive branch authorities and
activities to investigate and collect information regarding U.S.
citizens, including ongoing criminal investigations; how federal
agencies work with private and public entities to share information to
facilitate action against U.S. citizens, including any illegal or
unethical activities by agencies; and any other issues related to
violations of individual civil liberties. Among other provisions, the
resolution would specify that the subcommittee would be composed of 15
members, including six from the minority party. It would require the
subcommittee to issue a final report to the House on its findings no
later than Jan. 2, 2025, and sunset the subcommittee 30 days after it
files the report." The vote was on passage. The House adopted the
resolution by a vote of 221 to 211, thus the committee was established.

-   **The Committee Was Given Power To Investigate Executive Agencies
    And Their Ties To Private Entities And Was Given Oversight On
    Current Criminal Probes.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "House Republicans on Tuesday established a select subcommittee to
    investigate the 'weaponization' of the federal government. It will
    have the power to investigate executive branch agencies and their
    ties to private sector entities and have oversight of ongoing
    criminal probes. The House voted 221-211, along party lines, to
    approve the resolution (H Res 12) to create the subcommittee, one of
    the first actions of an aggressive Republican approach to oversight
    since they took control of the chamber." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Democrats Argued The Committee Was A Way For Republicans To
    Interfere With Former President Trump's Ongoing Investigations.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans likened the
    panel, which falls under the Judiciary Committee, to prior
    committees that investigated oversteps by the FBI and intelligence
    agencies. Democrats called it dangerous and a way for Republicans to
    interfere with ongoing investigations into former President Donald
    Trump." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Congressman Jim Jordan (R) Claimed That The Justice Department Had
    Investigated Parents Who Spoke At Local School Board Meetings And
    Investigated Communications With Social Media Platforms That Took
    Down Posts During The 2020 Election.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "During floor debate, Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan of
    Ohio pointed to a litany of alleged oversteps by the Justice
    Department in recent years, including investigations of parents who
    spoke at local school boards and communications with companies like
    Twitter about taking down posts during the 2020 election. 'We don't
    want to go after anyone, we want it to stop, and we want to respect
    the First Amendment to the Constitution that the greatest country in
    the world has,' Jordan said." \[Congressional Quarterly,
