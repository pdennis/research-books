# Equal Rights Amendment

### Ratification Deadline

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted To Remove The Deadline For The Equal Rights
Amendment Ratification, Which Would Allow The Proposed Constitutional
Amendment To Be Valid Whenever It Becomes Ratified By Three-Fourths Of
The States.** In March 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for a joint resolution
which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "remove the deadline
for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution,
which would state that 'equality of rights under the law shall not be
denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of
sex.' The ERA was proposed to the states in 1972, with a seven-year
deadline for ratification, which was subsequently extended through June
1982. The joint resolution would make the proposed constitutional
amendment valid as part of the Constitution whenever ratified by
three-fourths of the states." The vote was on passage. The House passed
the joint resolution by a vote of 222-204. The Senate did not take
substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 82,

    Virginia, Illinois and Nevada are asking the US District Court in
    Washington, DC, to force the archivist of the United States, who
    administers the ratification process, to 'carry out his statutory
    duty of recognizing the complete and final adoption' of the ERA as
    the 28th Amendment to the Constitution." \[CNN,

    argument that the ERA has already been ratified and should be
    published as the Constitution's 28th Amendment." \[CNN,

agreement, upon adoption of the rule, to a resolution (H Res 232) that

-   **The ERA Would Safeguard Women's Rights In The Constitution.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Democrats say that the ERA
    would finally enshrine equal rights for women in the Constitution
    and that Congress has the constitutional authority to retroactively
    remove the ratification deadline so the amendment can now be added
    to the Constitution." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Republicans Opposed The ERA Because They Believed It Would Be Used
    To Expand Abortion Rights.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "The ERA is also indivisible from the issue of abortion rights, with
    Republicans warning that ratification would lead to expanded use of
    abortion and rollbacks of anti-abortion legislation on the state
    level. Conservatives argue that because abortions are exclusive to
    women, any restrictions on the procedure could be deemed
    unconstitutional under the ERA. 'If ratified, the ERA would be used
    by pro-abortion groups to undo pro-life legislation and lead to more
    abortions and taxpayer funding of abortions,' \[Rep. Debbie\] Lesko
    warned." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **The ERA Had Bipartisan Support Until Social Conservatives
    Pressured Republicans To Oppose The Amendment In The 1970s.**
    According to Politico, "For most of its nearly 100-year-history, the
    ERA enjoyed bipartisan support, including from Presidents Richard
    Nixon and Dwight Eisenhower. But opposition from social
    conservatives in the 1970s prompted Republicans to drop it from
    their party platform in 1980, and to persuade the last few states
    needed to ratify not to do so." \[Politico,
