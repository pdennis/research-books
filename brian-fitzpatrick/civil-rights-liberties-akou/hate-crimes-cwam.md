### Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act, Which
Criminalized Lynching Under Federal Hate Crime Law.** In February 2022,
according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Emmett
Till Antilynching Act, which would "criminalize lynching under federal
hate crime law. Specifically, the bill would subject any individual who
conspires with another person to violate existing federal hate crime law
to a maximum prison term of 30 years, a criminal fine, or both, if the
crime results in death or serious bodily injury to the victim, or if it
includes attempted killing, kidnapping, attempted kidnapping, aggravated
sexual abuse or attempted aggravated sexual abuse. The provision would
apply to hate crimes defined in existing law, including those based on
an individual\'s actual or perceived race, religion, gender, sexual
orientation, disability or national origin." The vote was on passage.
The House passed the bill by a vote of 422-3. The Senate passed the
bill, sent it to the President, and ultimately became law. \[House Vote
