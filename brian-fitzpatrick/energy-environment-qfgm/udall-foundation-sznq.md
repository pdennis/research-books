# Udall Foundation

### Reauthorization

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Reauthorize The Udall Foundation Through FY
2028.** In February 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to
Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would reauthorize
the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation through fiscal 2028.
It would authorize \$2 million in annual funding for the Udall Trust
Fund through fiscal 2023. The bill would prohibit the foundation from
spending any interest generated by the funds appropriated to the trust
fund, starting in fiscal 2024, on education programs and scholarships
without further Congressional appropriations. It also would authorize
\$4 million annually to be deposited into the Environmental Dispute
Resolution Fund. Of that amount, \$3 million would be allocated each
year for operations of the McCain Center for Environmental Conflict
Resolution and \$1 million for grants to help state and local
governments, tribes, and non-government entities participate in
environmental conflict resolution proceedings. It would require the
inspector general of the Interior Department to complete an audit of the
Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation within four years of the
bill's enactment." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by
a vote of 350 to 58. \[House Vote 32,
