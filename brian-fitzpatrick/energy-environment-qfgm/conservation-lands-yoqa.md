# Conservation Lands

### Forest And Reef Conversation

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted To Reauthorize A 1998 Bill That Conserved
Tropical Forests And Also Expanded Coral Reef Conservation.** In
December 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "reauthorize\[d\] a 1998 act to conserve
tropical forests internationally, and expand\[ed\] its scope to also
focus on coral reef conservation. It would \[have\] authorize\[d\] \$20
million annually through fiscal 2020 for conservation programs,
including grants to other countries for maintaining coral reef
ecosystems." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the
bill. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a
vote of 332 to 43. The Senate had already passed the bill, thus sending
it to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 488,
