**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Choice In Automobile Retail Sales Act
Of 2023 And To Prohibit New Emissions Standards.** In December 2023,

as amended, that would prohibit the EPA from finalizing, implementing or
enforcing a May 2023 proposed rule that would establish new emissions
standards for light- and medium-duty vehicles beginning in model year
2027. It would also amend the Clean Air Act to prevent the EPA from
issuing any motor vehicle emission and pollution standards, effective on
or after Jan. 1, 2021, that either mandate the use of a specific
technology, or that would have the effect of limiting the availability
of new motor vehicles based on their engine type. It would require the
EPA, within 24 months of the bill's enactment, to modify any existing
motor vehicle emission standards in order to comply with the bill's
provisions." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 221 to 197, thus it was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 703,
