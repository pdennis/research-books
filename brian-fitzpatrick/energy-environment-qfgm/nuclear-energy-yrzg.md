### Nuclear Regulatory Commission

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Revamp The Nuclear Regulatory Commission.**
In February 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional
Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would revise the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission\'s (NRC) mission, modify nuclear regulatory
processes and increase hiring and retention flexibilities within the
NRC. Specifically, it would require the NRC to evaluate how to improve
the efficiency of its processes, including environmental reviews, and to
regularly review and assess its licensing performance metrics. It would
require the NRC to establish expedited processes for licensing new
nuclear reactors based on a previous design and located on the same site
as an existing reactor. It also would mandate the commission to
establish guidance for building nuclear reactors on brownfields sites,
and for licensing microreactors and fusion reactors. The measure would
modify the NRC\'s fee structure and authorize grants to cover the fee
costs for certain new nuclear reactors as well as allow the commission
to directly recruit and hire employees, increase compensation to retain
employees and grant hiring bonuses. It also would include provisions
intended to spur the production of nuclear energy both globally and
domestically, and to ensure that the U.S. becomes a major participant in
assisting other nations with the development of their nuclear power
resources." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote
of 365 to 36. \[House Vote 55,

-   **The Union Of Concerned Scientists Warned Of Dangerous Provisions
    In The Bill That Threatened The NRC's Ability To Protect Public
    Health And The Environment.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "The Union of Concerned Scientists wants to see changes in a bill
    (HR 6544) passed by the House in February to revamp regulation of
    the nuclear power industry. The scientific advocacy group said in an
    April 8 letter to House and Senate leaders that the House bill
    contains 'dangerous provisions' that could undermine the Nuclear
    Regulatory Commission\'s independence and oversight of the industry.
    The legislation threatens the NRC\'s 'ability to protect public
    health, worker safety and the environment from releases of
    radioactive material that could occur during nuclear power plant
    accidents and sabotage attacks,' said the letter to House Speaker
    Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer,
    D-N.Y. \[...\] he UCS argues the House bill should be reconciled
    with a Senate measure (S 1111) sponsored by Shelley Moore Capito,
    R-W.Va., by eliminating provisions that 'micromanage' NRC processes
    and allow foreign ownership of domestic nuclear plants."

### Radiation Exposure

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Amendment That Would Express An Apology
On Behalf Of Congress To Residents In New Mexico, Utah, Idaho, And Other
States That Have Suffered Exposure To Radiation From Nuclear Testing.**
In September 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment to the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 which would, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "provide an apology on behalf of Congress to
individuals in New Mexico, Utah, Idaho and other specified states and
territories who were exposed to radiation from nuclear testing." The
vote was on adoption of an amendment. The House adopted the amendment by
a vote of 240-185. \[House Vote 291,

### Regulations

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Reduce Regulatory Hurdles And To Increase
International Cooperation For For Nuclear Energy.** In May 2024,
Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill,
as amended, that would direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the
Energy Department to take steps to reduce regulatory hurdles to the
development and commercial deployment of advanced nuclear reactors and
related technologies. It also would streamline NRC licensing and review
procedures, increase international cooperation on nuclear energy with
U.S. partners and improve NRC workforce hiring and retention. The bill
also would direct the NRC to review and update its licensing procedures
for next generation reactor designs, including micro-reactors, fusion
reactors and its licensing and review for plants on reclaimed brownfield
sites. The bill also would grant the NRC direct hire ability and allow
the commission to pay employees a more competitive salary for certain
scientific and technical positions. The bill also would direct both the
NRC and DOE to take steps to improve U.S. nuclear technology and
information sharing with allies and partner countries, and permits
foreign governments and companies to invest in U.S. nuclear power
plants." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of
393 to 13. \[House Vote 194,

### Yucca Mountain

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For The FY 2020 Minibus Appropriations Bill,
Which Provided No Funding For The Yucca Mountain Waste Repository.** In
December 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for the FY 2020 minibus spending bill,
which represented 8 of the 12 appropriations bills. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "The bill includes no funding for the Yucca
Mountain Waste Repository in Nevada, nor does it include any funding for
interim storage of spent nuclear fuel." The vote was a motion to concur
in the Senate amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of
297-120. The Senate later passed the bill and the President signed the
bill into law. \[House Vote 689,

-   **The Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository Was Deeply Unpopular
    Amongst Nevadans.** According to USA Today, "Congress selected Yucca
    Mountain in 1987 to become the nation's permanent repository for
    nuclear waste generated by utility power plants and the military.
    The government already has spent \$15 billion studying the location,
    and the Energy Department began pursuing a license for the facility
    in 2008. But the Obama administration abandoned the project three
    years later amid intense opposition from residents and political
    leaders in Nevada, including Harry Reid, who at the time was the
    Senate's top Democrat." \[USA Today,

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted To Effectively Authorizing The Yucca Mountain
Nuclear Waste Repository.** In May 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for
legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"require\[d\] a decision within 30 months of enactment by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission on the licensing process and construction relating
to the nuclear repository at Yucca Mountain. It would also \[have\]
authorize\[d\] the establishment of interim storage facilities to be
operated by the Energy Department until the repository is finished, and
would additionally authorize a rail line to connect Yucca Mountain with
the national rail system. The bill would also \[have\] increase\[d\]
from 70,000 metric tons to 110,000, the allowable storage for the
repository and provide additional financing mechanisms for the Yucca
Mountain project as well as the compensation to Nevada for hosting the
national nuclear waste repository." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 340 to 72. The Senate took no substantive
action on the legislation. \[House Vote 179,
