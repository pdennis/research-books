### Resilience Improvement And Vulnerability To Natural Disasters

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Authorize Several Activities To Improve
Electric Grid Resilience And Direct The Energy Department To Keep A Map
Identifying Critical Electric Grid Infrastructure Vulnerable To Natural
Disasters.** In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted for the Continental Divide Trail Completion Act, which
would "authorize various activities to improve electric grid resilience
and direct the Energy Department to maintain a map identifying critical
electric grid infrastructure vulnerable to natural disasters to inform
federal disaster aid." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 218-199, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. The
Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 414,
