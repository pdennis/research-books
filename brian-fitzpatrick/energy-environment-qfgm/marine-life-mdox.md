### Sea Turtles

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Establish A Sea Turtle Rescue Grant.** In
April 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional
Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would require the Commerce
Department to establish a grant program for sea turtle rescue
assistance, which would include the recovery and treatment of stranded
sea turtles and data collection for scientific research. Grants to any
single entity would be limited to \$150,000 for a 12-month period and
would require a non-federal cost share of 50 percent. The bill would
require the department to establish stranding and rehabilitation regions
and distribute funds equally across the regions, taking into account the
needs of threatened or endangered turtles and each region's specific
needs over the previous five years." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 332 to 82. \[House Vote 111,
