# Energy Efficiency

### Appliance Standards

**2025: Fitzpatrick Voted To Disapprove A Department Of Energy Rule That
Established Energy Efficiency Standards For Various Appliances.** In
March 2025, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional
Quarterly, "the joint resolution that would provide for congressional
disapproval of, and nullify, the Department of Energy's final rule which
established new appliance energy efficiency certification reporting and
labeling requirements for dozens of products, including air
conditioners, heat pumps, pool equipment and walk-in freezers." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 222 to 203.

### Home Energy Rebates

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Providing \$9 Billion For Energy
Efficiency Improvement Rebates For Home Residences.** In August 2022,
according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted against
concurring in the Senate amendment to the Inflation Reduction Act of
2022, which would "provide \$9 billion for residential energy efficiency
improvement rebates." The vote was on a motion to concur. The House
concurred with the Senate by a vote 220-207, thus the bill was sent to
President Biden for final signage. President Biden signed the bill and
it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 420,
