# Offshore Drilling

### Oil And Gas Leasing

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For Ending Oil And Gas Leasing In The Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge Area Of Alaska.** In September 2019,
Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that would, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "repeal existing law authorizing an Interior Department
program for the leasing, development, and transportation of oil and gas
in and from the coastal plane of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It
would also require the Interior Department to collect inspection fees
from certain oil and gas facilities operating on the outer Continental
Shelf and set annual levels and schedules for fees collected from
facilities above the waterline, drilling rigs, and non-rig units. Such
fees would be deposited into a Treasury Department ocean energy safety
fund established under the bill\'s provisions, with funds to be made
available through annual appropriations acts to carry out inspections of
outer Continental Shelf facilities." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 225-193. \[House Vote 530,

-   **The Bill Blocked The Trump Administrations Plans To Expand
    Offshore Drilling, Which Was Opposed By Coastal Lawmakers Who
    Claimed Offshore Drilling Hurts Their Tourism And Seafood
    Industries.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Trump
    administration has proposed adding those areas to its offshore
    leasing plan as it seeks to expand the country's energy
    production. Those plans have met with resistance from coastal
    lawmakers and governors from both parties who fear the damage
    drilling activity could have on their tourism and seafood
    industries, as well as marine life. The administration has put its
    plan on hold, but lawmakers aren\'t taking chances. The mere specter
    of oily beaches can lead to hundreds of hotel cancellations, the
    lawmakers contend" \[Congressional Quarterly,

    and 180 million in gross domestic product, while harming countless
    coastal ecosystems. He also noted that every east and west coast

    security \[...\] Republicans who support Trump's energy goals argued
    on Tuesday that the bills would cede U.S. global energy leadership

further oil and gas leasing within the Atlantic Region or Pacific Region
outer Continental Shelf planning areas. It would also require the

Continental Shelf to conduct an archaeological study for their lease
area. The rule requires such operators to submit the study to DOI's
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management when they put forward exploration or
development plans of such resources for approval, in order to ensure
that such activities won\'t harm anything of historical, cultural or
archaeological significance." The vote was on passage. The House passed

    highly controversial plan to expand offshore drilling off the U.S.
    Pacific and Atlantic coasts, the west coast of Florida in the Gulf
    of Mexico, and Alaska. Though this drilling proposal has been
    delayed as a result of litigation, coastal communities remain deeply
    concerned that the administration's final decision will irreversibly
    damage the health of America's coastal and marine environments."

    the additional fossil fuels extracted would add as many as 46
    billion metric tons of GHG emissions to the world's atmosphere. That

    activity, the number of large oil spills---those of at least 42,000

-   **In 2018 The Trump Administration Put Forward A Proposal To Expand
    Offshore Drilling Off The U.S. Pacific And Atlantic Coasts That Has
    Been Delayed Due To Litigation.** According to the Center for
    American Progress, "In 2018, the Trump administration put forward a
    highly controversial plan to expand offshore drilling off the U.S.
    Pacific and Atlantic coasts, the west coast of Florida in the Gulf
    of Mexico, and Alaska. Though this drilling proposal has been
    delayed as a result of litigation, coastal communities remain deeply
    concerned that the administration's final decision will irreversibly
    damage the health of America's coastal and marine environments."

-   **CAP: The Proposal Would Emit An Additional 46 Billion Metric Tons
    Of Greenhouse Gases, Equivalent To The Yearly Emissions Of 10
    Billion Cars And 3 Percent Of What Remains In The Global Carbon
    Budget.** According to the Center for American Progress, "The data
    show that if this plan were implemented, the resulting combustion of
    the additional fossil fuels extracted would add as many as 46
    billion metric tons of GHG emissions to the world's atmosphere. That
    is nearly seven times more than all GHG emitted by the entire United
    States each year. Put another way, such an increase is the
    equivalent of the yearly emissions from nearly 10 billion
    cars---nine times as many cars as are on the road worldwide today
    \[...\] The 46 billion metric tons of carbon that would be released
    by Trump's plan would account for more than 3 percent of what
    remains in the entire global carbon budget." \[Center for American

-   **CAP: The Proposal "Would Also Lead To More Than 10 Times More
    Large Oil Spills," An Increase from 8 to 92 over 30 years.**
    According to the Center for American Progress, "According to CAP
    estimates, the Trump administration drilling plan would also lead to
    more than 10 times more large oil spills than the current plan
    \[...\] Based on the spill rate associated with increased drilling
    activity, the number of large oil spills---those of at least 42,000
    gallons, or 1,000 barrels---would increase from eight to 92 over the
    30-year course of the plan." \[Center for American Progress,

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Opening Up Additional Areas
Of The Outer Continental Shelf For Energy Exploitation.** In October
2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a budget resolution that would in part,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new
budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal
2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap
total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and
would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for
fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to
war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of
the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the
Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program.
It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the
U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the
budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget
resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281.

-   **Budget Called For Opening Up Additional Areas Of The Outer
    Continental Shelf For Energy Exploitation** According to the
    Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "This budget proposes
    opening up new areas of the Outer Continental Shelf for domestic
    energy production, repealing the ban on energy exploration in the
    Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, allowing states to develop
    resources on federal land within their borders, and stopping the
    federal government from implementing any hydraulic fracturing
    regulations in a state that has already issued its own regulations."
