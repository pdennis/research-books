### Authorities

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Transfer The Authority To Approve Gas
Imports And Exports From The Department Of Energy To The Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission.** In February 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for "the
bill that would remove the Energy Department\'s role in approving gas
imports and exports and instead give that authority to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission. It also would modify current law to
provide FERC the exclusive authority to approve or deny an application
for the siting, construction, expansion or operation of any facility to
export or import natural gas, not just a liquefied natural gas terminal.
It also would require FERC, when determining whether to grant such an
application, to deem such exportation or importation to be consistent
with the public interest." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 224 to 200. \[House Vote 52,

Congressional Actions, [H.R.
7176](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7176/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bill Came As A Response To President Biden's Pause On
    Liquefied Natural Gas Exports.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The House Republican majority, fighting the Biden
    administration\'s pause on some liquefied natural gas exports,
    passed a bill that would cut the Energy Department out of the export
    review process. The bill passed 224-200 with nine Democrats joining
    the Republicans. The legislation (HR 7176) sets the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission as the sole authority for the siting,
    construction, expansion or operation of LNG import or export
    facilities. It would also require the commission to deem the import
    and export of natural gas to be in the public interest. Those
    changes would all but eliminate the role for administration
    officials, handing it to a commission made up of officials from both
    parties." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/15/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7941545?14)\]

-   **President Biden's Pause On Exports Applied To Non-Free Trade
    Agreement Countries.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    proposal received renewed attention after the administration's Jan.
    26 announcement that it would pause approvals of new export permits
    to non-free trade agreement countries. During this pause, the Energy
    Department will review the economic, national security and
    environment impact of these exports, criteria used to inform whether
    they are in the public interest." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/15/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7941545?14)\]

-   **The Biden Administration Stated The Bill Put Consumer Interest And
    Domestic Energy Security At Risk.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The Office of Management and Budget voiced its
    opposition to the bill, but stopped short of promising a veto in a
    statement of administration policy released Feb. 13. It said the
    bill would 'eliminate an important check that exports to non-FTA
    countries will be consistent with U.S. law and policy.' 'The
    Administration believes that the critical protections current law
    provides, which this legislation would repeal, should be retained to
    protect residential and industrial consumers and national and
    domestic energy security,' the statement said." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [2/15/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7941545?14)\]

### Energy Conservation Standards

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Prohibit Conservation Standards For Clothes
Washers.** In December 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to
Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would prohibit the Energy
Department from prescribing or enforcing an energy conservation standard
for clothes washers unless the standard is technologically feasible,
economically justified, unlikely to result in additional net costs for
consumers and likely to result in significant conservation of energy."
The House passed the bill by a vote of 215 to 200. \[House Vote 497,

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Overhaul The Energy Department's Procedures
For Issuing Energy Efficiency Standards For Appliances.** In May 2024,
Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill,
as amended, that would overhaul the Energy Department\'s procedures for
issuing energy efficiency standards with respect to certain home
appliances. The bill would allow an individual to petition the DOE to
conduct a rulemaking to determine whether such standards for such
products should be revoked. It would require the DOE to grant a petition
to determine if the standards for a product should be amended or revoked
if there is certain evidence, including that such standards result in
additional costs to consumers. It would require the DOE, within two
years of issuing any final rule for a new or amended energy conservation
standard for such a product, to evaluate it to determine whether the
standard is technologically feasible and economically justified and
whether the regulatory impact analysis for the rule remains accurate. As
amended, it would provide that the April 2024 Energy Department final
rule titled 'Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards
for Distribution Transformers' would not take effect." The vote was on
the passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 212 to 195. \[House

-   **The Bill Allowed Petitions To Revoke Or Amend Energy Conservation
    Standards And Required Standards To Be Economically Justified
    Despite This Language Already Existing In Law.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The bill (HR 6192) from Rep. Debbie Lesko,
    R-Ariz., to be considered under a rule, would amend the Energy
    Policy and Conservation Act (PL 94--163) to allow the Energy
    Department to grant a petition to revoke or amend energy
    conservation standards if it finds they are not feasible with
    current technology. It would also require that any standards be
    economically justified, meaning they are unlikely to raise consumer
    costs while resulting in 'significant conservation of energy or
    water.' While this language is in the EPCA, Republicans said it was
    necessary to reaffirm these requirements due to the Biden
    administration\'s recent rulemaking." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/7/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8004058?13)\]

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Maintaining The Energy Department's
Procedures For Issuing Energy Efficiency Standards For Appliances.** In
May 2024, Fitzpatrick voted against , according to Congressional
Quarterly, the "motion to recommit the bill to the House Energy and
Commerce Committee." The vote was on the motion to recommit. The
underlying bill overhauled the Department Of Energy's procedures
relating to energy efficiency standards for appliances. The House
rejected the motion by a vote of 202 to 206. \[House Vote 183,

**2024: Fitzpatrick Vted Against A Department Of Energy Rule On Energy
Conservation Standards For Distribution Transformers.** In May 2024,
Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "amendment
no. 3 that would provide that the April 2024 Energy Department final
rule titled 'Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards
for Distribution Transformers' would not take effect." The vote was on
the amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 208 to 199.

### Energy Efficiency And Renewable Energy Programs

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Reducing Funding For The Energy
Department's Energy Efficiency And Renewable Energy Programs To Offset
An Increase In Funding For The Department's Grid Deployment Account.**
In July 2024, Fitzpatrick voted against , according to Congressional
Quarterly, "amendment no. 64 that would increase by \$10 million funding
for the Energy Department\'s Grid Deployment account, intended to
enhance the security of existing electrical transformers from cyber
threats and from physical attacks from individuals. As an offset, it
would reduce funding by an equal amount for the Energy Department\'s
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs and activities." The
vote was on the amendment. The underlying legislation was the FY 2025
Energy-Water appropriations. The House rejected the amendment by a vote
of 214 to 203. \[House Vote 379,

### Energy Surveys On Crude Oil And Fuel Markets

**2022: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against An Amendment That Required
The Energy Information Administration To Conduct Surveys Of Energy
Companies On U.S. Crude Oil And Transportation Fuel Markets.** In May
2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick effectively
voted against the manager's amendment to the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging
Prevention Act, which would "require the Energy Department\'s Energy
Information Administration to conduct surveys of energy companies to
collect information on U.S. crude oil and transportation fuel markets;
consistently and promptly publish analyses of survey results; and enter
into a data-sharing agreement to promptly share information collected
with the Federal Trade Commission. It would authorize such sums as
necessary through fiscal 2027 to carry out the survey requirements." The
vote was on the adoption of the rule. The House adopted the rule by a
vote of 218-202, thus the manager's amendment was automatically adopted.

provides a total of \$38.6 billion for the Energy Department --- \$2.9
billion (8%) more than FY 2019 funding and \$7.1 billion (22%) more than
requested. Within the total provided for the department, almost half
(\$16.7 billion) is for nuclear weapons activities conducted by the
National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and another \$6.3
billion is for continued environmental cleanup of defense facilities
where nuclear weapons activities were conducted. When including
non-defense cleanup programs, the bill provides a total of \$7.5 billion
for environmental cleanup. It provides \$7.0 billion for the Energy
Department\'s science account --- \$415 million (6%) more than FY 2019
and \$1.5 billion (26%) more than requested. The account funds the
department\'s work on basic energy research, nuclear physics, biological
and environmental sciences, fusion and other related endeavors. It
rejects the administration\'s request to eliminate funding for the

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For The \$1.3 Trillion FY 2018 Omnibus
Spending Deal Which Raised Spending By \$138 Billion Over FY 2017
Levels, Including \$34.5 Billion For The Energy Department.** In March
2018, Fitzpatrick voted for the FY 2018 Omnibus spending bill. According
to Congressional Quarterly, "Combined, the spending measures would
provide about \$1.3 trillion in discretionary spending, with \$1.2
trillion subject to discretionary spending caps, and \$78.1 billion
designated as Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The measure\'s
spending levels are consistent with the increased defense and
non-defense budget caps set by the two-year budget deal agreed to last
month. That agreement increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80 billion

    technologies by \$11 million. It also increases sustainable
    transportation research (such as vehicle and fuel technologies
    (including hydrogen and fuel cell technologies) by 10%, and energy
    efficiency research for building and manufacturing by 10%. The
    administration proposed substantial cuts to all the programs within

    funding). The total includes \$35 million in unrequested funds to
    support two large-scale pilot programs that are to focus on
    transformational coal technologies that represent a new way to
    convert energy and enable a step change in performance, efficiency
    and the cost of electricity compared to today\'s technologies."
