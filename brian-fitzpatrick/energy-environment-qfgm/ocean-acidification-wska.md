# Ocean Acidification

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For Providing \$19.1 Billion In Supplemental
Funds For Damage Caused By Natural Disasters.** In June 2019,
Fitzpatrick voted for a motion that would, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "authorize the establishment of a program awarding
competitive prizes for the development of monitoring, management, and
adaption options in response to ocean acidification, particularly for
programs to address communities, environments, or industries "in
distress" due to ocean acidification." The vote was on a motion to
suspend the rules and pass the bill as amended. The House agreed to the
motion by a vote of 395-22. \[House Vote 241,
