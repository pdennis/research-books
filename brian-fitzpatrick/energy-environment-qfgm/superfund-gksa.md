### Funding

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Increase EPA Superfund Funding By \$12
Million.** In September 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment that
would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "increase\[d\] funding
for EPA Superfund sites by \$12 million, and would \[have\]
decrease\[d\] funding for the Bureau of Land Management's oil and gas
