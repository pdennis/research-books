### Saline Lake Ecosystems

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Provide \$5 Million Annually Through FY
2027 For The Establishment Of The Saline Lake Ecosystems In The Great
Basin States Assessment And Monitoring Program.** In December 2022,
according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Saline
Lake Ecosystems in the Great Basin States Program Act of 2022, which
would "authorize \$5 million annually through fiscal 2027 for the U.S.
Geological Survey to establish a Saline Lake Ecosystems in the Great
Basin States Assessment and Monitoring Program. The program would assess
and monitor the hydrology of saline lake ecosystems in the Great Basin
and the migratory birds and other wildlife that depend on those
ecosystems to support coordinated management and conservation actions.
It would require the agency to develop an implementation plan with input
from other federal, state and tribal agencies, educational institutions,
nonprofits and other local stakeholders and submit a report to Congress,
within one year of enactment, on the plan." The vote was on passage. The
House passed the bill by a vote of 356-56, thus the bill was sent to
President Biden and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 518,
