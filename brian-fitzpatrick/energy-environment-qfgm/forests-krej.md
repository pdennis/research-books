### Logging In The Tongass

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Amendment To The FY 2020 Continuing
Appropriations To Curb Logging In Alaska's Tongass National Forest.** In
June 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment that would, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit the use of funds made available under
the bill to plan or construct, for the purpose of timber harvesting by
private entities, a forest development road in the Tongass National
Forest in Southeast Alaska." The vote was on adoption of the amendment.
The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 243-188. \[House Vote 382,

-   **The Amendment Effectively Blocked The Trump Administration's
    Proposal To Allow Logging In The Tongass National Forest.**
    According to the Washington Post, "The Trump administration \[In
    October, 2019\] proposed allowing logging on more than half of
    Alaska's 16.7 million-acre Tongass National Forest, the largest
    intact temperate rainforest in North America. President Trump
    instructed federal officials to reverse long-standing limits on tree
    cutting at the request of Alaska's top elected officials, on the
    grounds that it will boost the local economy." \[Washington Post,

-   **Alaska's Entirely Republican Delegation Supported Expanding
    Development In The Tongass.** According to the Washington Post,
    "Alaska's entire congressional delegation, which is all Republican
    members, has also asked Trump to expand development in the Tongass
    \[...\] 'As Alaskans know well, the Roadless Rule hinders our
    ability to responsibly harvest timber, develop minerals, connect
    communities, or build energy projects to lower costs --- including
    renewable energy projects like hydropower, all of which severely
    impedes the economy of Southeast,' said Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska)
    in a statement." \[Washington Post,
    [10/15/19](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/trump-administration-proposes-expanding-logging-in-alaskas-tongass-national-forest/2019/10/15/92e47db8-ef77-11e9-8693-f487e46784aa_story.html)\]

-   **The Regulations, Known As The 'Roadless Rule,' Provided Critical
    Protection To The Region's Salmon Fishery And Tourism Operations.**
    According to the Washington Post, "But critics say that protections
    under the 'roadless rule,' finalized just before President Bill
    Clinton left office in 2001, are critical to protecting the region's
    lucrative salmon fishery and tourism operations." \[Washington Post,
    [10/15/19](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/trump-administration-proposes-expanding-logging-in-alaskas-tongass-national-forest/2019/10/15/92e47db8-ef77-11e9-8693-f487e46784aa_story.html)\]

-   **Washington Post: Road Building Would "Fragment Critical Habitat"
    And Logging Could Remove Trees That "Trap Sediment And Keep
    Waterways Cool."** According to the Washington Post, "scientists who
    have worked in the area say the road building that would be required
    to take out more timber could fragment critical habitat, and logging
    could remove trees that trap sediment and keep waterways cool."

### Logging Regulations, Generally

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Exempting Federal Forest Regulations
After Certain Disasters As Part Of Legislation Allowing Emergency FEMA
Funds To Go To Wildfire Disasters.** In November 2017, Fitzpatrick voted
against legislation that would have, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "allow\[ed\] for a presidential declaration of a major
disaster with regard to wildfires, which would allow for the release of
funding from Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund
to fight major wildfires, and would modify the disaster cap under the
Budget Control Act to account for expected wildfire funding needs. It
would also \[have\] exempt\[ed\] various forest management activities
from filing environmental impact statements and would provide for
expedited timber salvage operations and reforestation activities after
catastrophic events. It would \[have\] prohibit\[d\] any court from
issuing restraining orders or injunctions against salvage operations or
reforestation activities undertaken in response to a large-scale
catastrophic event." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill
by a vote of 232 to 188. The Senate took no substantive action on the
legislation. \[House Vote 598,

Quarterly, [11/1/17](http://www.cq.com/vote/2017/H/598?14);

2936](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2936/all-actions)\]

-   **Democrats Who Opposed The Bill Opposed The Legislation Because It
    Reduced Too Many Environmental Protections.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents of the bill, primarily
    Democrats, say that it fails to protect the environment because it
    allows too many exemptions from environmental reviews, permits
    immediate logging after wildfire disasters, changes the goals of
    forest management and disregards the right of citizens to confront
    their government. They say it significantly expands the acreage in
    which non-reviewed logging activities can occur, including by
    permitting clear-cutting of forests, which is currently not allowed.
    They argue that the bill\'s restrictions on legal activities,
    including the requirement to post bonds when challenging
    collaborative projects and the ban on recovering attorneys\' fees if
    plaintiffs win, will block concerned citizens and allow only
    corporations with deep pockets to make legal challenges. Opponents
    also condemn the change in dedicated funding under the Rural Schools
    program, saying it fundamentally changes the direction of the
    program from restoring forests and watersheds to generating revenue
    through timber sales." \[Congressional Quarterly,
