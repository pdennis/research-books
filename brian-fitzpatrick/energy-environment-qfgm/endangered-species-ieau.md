### Grey Wolf

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Removing Federal Endangered Species
Protections For The Grey Wolf.** In November 2018, Fitzpatrick voted
against legislation that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would
direct the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to issue a rule removing the
gray wolf from the list of endangered and threatened wildlife, thus
removing federal protections for the species, in the 48 contiguous
United States. It would also direct the Interior Department to reissue a
2011 rule delisting gray wolves in the Western Great Lakes region of
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and would exempt both rules, and
another rule delisting the species in Wyoming, from judicial review."
The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 196 to
180. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House
