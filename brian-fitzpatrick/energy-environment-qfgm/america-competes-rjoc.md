    That Speaker Nancy Pelosi Should Have Kept The Bill Focused
    Exclusively On Countering Chinese Influence.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Other provisions in the House Democrats'
    legislative package address climate change and low-carbon energy
    programs. Republicans objected to those and other provisions, saying
    Pelosi should have kept her version as narrowly focused on China as
    did the Senate." \[Congressional Quarterly,
