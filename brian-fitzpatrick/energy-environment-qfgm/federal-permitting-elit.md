Declaring A Moratorium On Fracking And From Taking Actions That Would
Delay New Leases, Sales And Drilling Permits For Oil And Gas, Coal Or
Mineral Exploration.** In March 2023, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted against the Lower Energy Costs Act, which
would "prohibit the president from declaring a moratorium on the use of
hydraulic fracturing and from taking any action that would delay new
leases, sales and drill permits for oil and gas, coal or mineral
exploration." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 225 to 204, thus the bill was sent to the Senate for their
consideration. \[House Vote 182,

    End Burning Fossil Fuels To Prevent Catastrophic Climate Change.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Passage comes a little more
    than a week after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the
    world's leading body of climate scientists, warned humanity must
    work swiftly to slash greenhouse gas emissions and stop burning
    fossil fuels to avert catastrophic rapid climate change."

### Streamlining

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Fiscal Responsibility Act Of 2023,
Which Streamlined The Permitting Process And Review For Federal Projects
Under The National Environmental Policy Act.** In May 2023, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Fiscal Responsibility
Act of 2023, which, "Among provisions to streamline the permitting
process under the National Environmental Policy Act, the bill would set
deadlines of one year for environmental assessments and two years for
environmental impact statements; limit the page length of such
documents; adjust thresholds for levels of review; limit the scope of
reviews to 'reasonably foreseeable' environmental effects of an action;
and limit the definition of major federal actions under NEPA to those
subject to 'substantial federal control and responsibility.'" The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 314 to 117, thus
the bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate passed the bill, sent it to
