### Authorizing Lease Sales

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Authorizing Wind Lease Sales On The
Shelf Adjacent To U.S. Territories And Against Prohibiting New Wind Or
Solar Development Rights On Federal Lands For A Decade With The
Exception Of Certain Oil Or Gas Lease Sales.** In August 2022, according
to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted against concurring in the
Senate amendment to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which would
"authorize wind lease sales adjacent to U.S. territories but prohibit
new wind or solar development rights on federal lands for 10 years
unless the department completes certain oil or gas lease sales." The
vote was on a motion to concur. The House concurred with the Senate by a
vote 220-207, thus the bill was sent to President Biden for final
signage. President Biden signed the bill and it ultimately became law.

### Offshore Wind Environmental Review Study

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Amendment That Would Require A Study On
The Sufficiency Of The Environmental Review Process For Offshore Wind
Projects, The Impacts On Whales, Fishing, Air Quality, Military Use, And
The Sustainability Of Shoreline Beaches, And The Costs Of Offshore Wind
Projects.** In March 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment to the Lower Energy Costs Act, which
would "require the Government Accountability Office, within 60 days of
enactment, to conduct a study to assess the sufficiency of the
environmental review process for offshore wind projects. Among other
provisions, it would require the study to consider the impacts of
offshore wind projects on whales, fishing, air quality, military use,
and the sustainability of shoreline beaches and inlets; the impacts of
hurricanes on offshore wind projects; how agencies determine which
stakeholders are consulted; and the estimated cost of and who pays for
offshore wind projects." The vote was on the adoption of an amendment.
The House adopted the amendment by a vote of 244 to 189. \[House Vote

### Tax Credits For Wind Energy Production

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The House GOP's 2017 Tax Reform Plan Which
Significantly Cut Taxes For The Rich And Corporations And Phased Out The
Investment Tax Credit For Wind Energy.** In November 2017, Fitzpatrick
voted for reconciliation legislation which significantly altered the
federal tax code. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill
substantially restructures the U.S. tax code to simplify the code and
reduce taxes on individuals, corporations and small businesses. For
individuals, it consolidates the current seven tax brackets down to four
and eliminates or restricts many tax credits and deductions, including
by eliminating the deduction for state and local income taxes and
limiting the deduction for property taxes to \$10,000 and the interest
deduction for a home mortgage to the first \$500,000 worth of a loan.
\[...\] On the business side, it reduces the corporate tax from 35% to
20% and establishes a 'territorial' tax system that would exempt most
income derived overseas from U.S. corporate taxation. It allows
businesses to immediately expense 100% of the cost of assets acquired
and placed into service, and for small businesses it raises the Section
179 expensing limit to \$5 million for five years. It also establishes a
25% rate for a portion of pass-through business income that would
otherwise have to be paid at the ordinary individual tax level, and for
small businesses where an individual would receive less than \$150,000
in pass-through income it taxes the first \$75,000 of that income at a
9% rate." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote
of 227 to 205. President Trump later signed an amended version of the
bill into law. \[House Vote 637,

-   **Bill Repeals Numerous Energy Tax Credits, Including The Per-Barrel
    Credit For Crude Oil And Certain Clean Energy Tax Credits.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill makes a number of
    modifications to tax credits provided for the production of energy,
    including repeal of the inflation adjustment for the renewable
    electricity production tax credit for qualified projects placed in
    service after Nov. 2, 2017, with the credit amount reverting to 1.5
    cents per kilowatt hour (from 2.3 cents in 2016), and harmonization
    of the expiration dates, phase-out schedules and application of the
    30% investment tax credit as applied to solar, fuel cell, and small
    wind energy. That investment tax credit would not be available for
    properties beginning construction after 2021." \[Congressional

### Wind Energy Impact Study

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Amendment That Would Require A Report
On All Potential Adverse Impacts Of Wind Energy Development In The North
Atlantic Planning area, Including Infrastructure And Vessel Traffic,
Maritime Safety, Economic Effects On Commercial Fishing, And Marine
Environment And Ecology.** In March 2023, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment to the Lower Energy Costs
Act, which would "require the Government Accountability Office to
publish a report on all potential adverse effects of wind energy
development in the North Atlantic Planning Area, including associated
infrastructure and vessel traffic, on maritime safety, the economic
impacts on commercial fishing, and marine environment and ecology." The
vote was on the adoption of an amendment. The House adopted the
