# Critical Minerals

### Increasing Mining And Waiving Pollution Regulations

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Boosting Domestic Critical Mineral
Supplies Through Increased Mining And By Allowing The EPA To Temporarily
Waive Certain Pollution Regulations At Certain Critical Energy Resource
Facilities.** In March 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted against the Lower Energy Costs Act, which, "To address
critical mineral supply, the bill would require the Energy Department to
conduct ongoing assessments of and develop strategies to strengthen
domestic supply chains for critical energy resources, including through
increased mining and processing and permit the EPA to temporarily waive
certain pollution regulation requirements for processing and refining
projects at critical energy resource facilities to address supply chain
concerns. It would make coal and critical mineral mining projects
eligible for certain expedited infrastructure permitting processes;
provide for appointment of a lead agency to coordinate the permitting
process for mineral exploration; and limit the withdrawal of federal
lands and waters from mineral leasing." The vote was on passage. The
House passed the bill by a vote of 225 to 204, thus the bill was sent to
the Senate for their consideration. \[House Vote 182,

-   **The Bill Passed After The Intergovernmental Panel On Climate
    Change Urged Action To Swiftly Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions And
    End Burning Fossil Fuels To Prevent Catastrophic Climate Change.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Passage comes a little more
    than a week after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the
    world's leading body of climate scientists, warned humanity must
    work swiftly to slash greenhouse gas emissions and stop burning
    fossil fuels to avert catastrophic rapid climate change."

Critical Minerals.** In November 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according
to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would amend the Energy Act of
2020 to include critical materials in the definition of critical
minerals. The bill would place onto the U.S. Geological Survey\'s list

material deemed to be a critical material by the Energy Department." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 245 to 155.
