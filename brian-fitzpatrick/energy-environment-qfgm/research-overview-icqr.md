### Inter-Department Collaboration

**2025: Fitzpatrick Voted To Allow The Departments Of Energy And The
Environment To Enter Into A Memorandum Of Understanding For
Cross-Cutting And Collaborative Research.** In March 2025, Fitzpatrick
voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would
direct the Energy and Agriculture departments to enter into a memorandum
of understanding (or another interagency agreement) to establish
cross-cutting and collaborative research and development activities
focused on jointly advancing the departments\' research missions. It
would authorize both departments to conduct or support collaborative
research in a variety of areas, including fundamental research on
agricultural, biological, computational and environmental sciences and
engineering, advanced crop science, biological pest control, biofuels,
environmentally sustainable fuels, invasive species management, rural
grid modernization, wildfire prevention and mitigation, and science and
technology solutions in the agricultural and energy sectors. It also
would authorize both departments to enter into agreements to reimburse
each other and other appropriate entities. The bill also would require
the Agriculture and Energy departments to jointly report to Congress,
within two years of the bill's enactment, on cooperative research
activities undertaken by the two departments, collaborative research
achievements, potential opportunities to expand the departments\'
respective technical capabilities, and areas of future cooperation and
coordination." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 372 to 35. \[House Vote 73,

### Low-Emission Concrete

**2025: Fitzpatrick Voted To Establish A Seven Year Research Project On
The Development Of Low-Emission Concrete, Asphalt, And Cement.** In
March 2025, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional
Quarterly, "the bill that would codify certain Energy Department
activities related to research, development and demonstration projects
for producing cement, concrete and asphalt with low emissions. The bill
would require the department, within 180 days of the bill's enactment,
to establish a seven-year program of research, development,
demonstration and commercial application of advanced tools, technologies
and methods for advanced production and use of low-emissions cement,
concrete and asphalt. It would stipulate that the DOE coordinate with
all programs and activities related to industrial and manufacturing
technologies authorized in the Energy Act of 2020, and all relevant
program offices within the department. Among other provisions, it would
require the DOE to develop a five-year strategic plan identifying
research, development, demonstration and commercial application goals
for the program. It would mandate that the program focus on heat
generation, carbon capture, resource efficiency and high-performance
computing. It would require the DOE, in collaboration with the
Transportation Department, the General Services Administration, industry
partners, institutions of higher education and the National
Laboratories, to support demonstrations of advanced production of
low-emissions cement, concrete and asphalt." The vote was on passage.
The House passed the bill by a vote of 350 to 73. \[House Vote 74,
