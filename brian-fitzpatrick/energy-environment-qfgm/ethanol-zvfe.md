### Renewable Fuel Standard

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Ending The Ethanol Fuel
Blending Mandate From The RFS.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted
against a budget resolution that would in part, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget
authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by
reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total
discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would
assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal
2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or
terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010
health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's
Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would
require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S.
Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the
budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget
resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281.

-   **Budget Called For Ending The Ethanol Fuel Blending Mandate From
    The RFS** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018
    Budget, "The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is a program that
    requires fuel sold in the U.S. to contain a minimum volume of
    renewable fuels. However, the standard has caused a dramatic
    increase in the price of corn, food, and gasoline.93 A reform of the
    standard would end ethanol fuel-blending mandates. This proposal
    mirrors Representative Bob Goodlatte's H.R. 1314, the Renewable Fuel
    Standard Elimination Act." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed
