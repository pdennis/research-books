# Greenhouse Gas Emissions

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For The FY 2020 Minibus Appropriations Bill,
Which Placed Restrictions On The EPA's Ability To Curb Greenhouse Gas
Emissions.** In December 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for the FY 2020 minibus
spending bill, which represented 8 of the 12 appropriations bills.
According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure prohibits EPA from
issuing a rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from
manure management systems, bars the EPA from imposing reporting
requirements regarding greenhouse gas emissions, and prohibits EPA from
using funds to regulate lead content in ammunition or fishing tackle
under the Toxic Substances Control Act." The vote was a motion to concur
in the Senate amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of
297-120. The Senate later passed the bill and the President signed the
bill into law. \[House Vote 689,

### Clean Power Plan

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against An Amendment To The FY 2020 Continuing
Appropriations To Defund The Clean Power Plan.** In June 2019,
Fitzpatrick voted against an amendment that would, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit the use of funds made available under
the bill to implement two October 2015 Environmental Protection Agency
rules regarding regulation of carbon pollution and greenhouse gas
emissions." The vote was on adoption of the amendment. The House
rejected the amendment by a vote of 192-240. \[House Vote 381,

-   **The Amendment Would Defund The Clean Power Plan.** According to
    Congressional Records, Representative Jeff Duncan introduced the
    amendment "'to ensure that no funds go to the Obama-era Clean Power
    Plan.'" \[House Congressional Record,
    [6/20/12](https://www.congress.gov/116/crec/2019/06/20/CREC-2019-06-20-pt1-PgH4929-2.pdf)\]

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Stopping The Clean Power
Plan.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a budget resolution
that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for
\$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance
the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over
10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion
for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency
Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would
incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense
account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and
would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into
a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs,
such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was
an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC
budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555,

-   **Legislation Would Block The Clean Power Plan.** According to the
    Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "The RSC budget would
    block the Obama administration's so-called Clean Power Plan. Despite
    the fact the American people rejected the cap-and-trade proposal,
    the Obama EPA had been moving ahead with job-killing climate change
    regulations on new and existing power plants until a stay was
    granted by the Supreme Court. This regulation could cost the economy
    between \$41 and \$73 billion per year, hitting consumers in the
    wallet.91 The budget would block other anti-energy EPA regulations,
    such as the Ozone rule, which has been called 'the most expensive
    regulation of all time.'" \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed
    10/17/17](https://rsc-walker.house.gov/files/Initiatives/SecuringAmericasFutureEconomyRSCFY2018Budget.pdf)\]

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Subject Rules That Add The Equivalent Of
25,000 Metric Tons Or More Of Carbon emissions To Be Considered A 'Major
Rule' Under The REINS Act, Thus Requiring Congressional Approval.** In
January 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment to the REINS Act which
would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] agencies
to include an accounting of greenhouse gas emission impacts associated
with a rule in the report that would be required by the bill to be
submitted to Congress. The report also would \[have\] need\[ed\] to
include an analysis of the rule's impacts on low-income and rural
communities. If a rule would \[have\] increase\[d\] carbon equivalent
emissions by 25,000 metric tons annually or possibly increase the risk
of certain diseases to low-income or rural communities, then the rule
would be considered a 'major rule.'" The underlying legislation was the
REINS Act. The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the
amendment by a vote of 193 to 230. \[House Vote 13,
[1/5/17](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll013.xml); Congressional

26](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/26/all-actions)\]

-   **The REINS Act Would Amend The Rule Making Process To Require
    'Major Rules' -- Those With An Annual Economic Impact Of More Than
    \$100 -- To Need Congressional Approval.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "This bill modifies the federal rule-making
    process by preventing all 'major rules' from being implemented
    unless Congress enacts legislation approving them. Specifically, it
    amends the Congressional Review Act (CRA; PL 104-121) to require
    Congress to approve executive agency regulatory proposals that are
    deemed to be 'major rules' --- rather than just giving Congress an
    opportunity to disapprove those proposed rules and regulations, as
    is currently the case under the CRA. The measure creates expedited
    procedures for House and Senate consideration of congressional
    resolutions of approval, which would not be subject to amendment.
    Under the measure, 'major rules' that would require congressional
    approval to be implemented generally would be those having an annual
    economic impact greater than \$100 million. Proposed rules
    determined to be non-major would not need congressional approval to
    be implemented, but Congress could move to disapprove such rules
    using existing CRA disapproval procedures." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [12/30/16](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5010999/11?22)\]

### Federal Acquisition Regulation Council Rule

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Prohibiting The Implementation Of A
Federal Acquisition Regulation Council Rule Regarding Greenhouse Gas

according to Congressional Quarterly, "amendment no. 164 that would
prohibit the use of funds under the bill to finalize, implement or
enforce the Federal Acquisition Regulation Council\'s 2022 proposed rule
regarding disclosures of greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related
financial risk." The vote was on the amendment. The underlying
legislation was the FY 2025 Defense Appropriations. The House adopted
the amendment by a vote of 211 to 199. \[House Vote 328,

-   **The Rule Required Federal Contractors To Report Their Greenhouse
    Gas Emissions And Climate-Related Financial Risk And To Establish
    Targets To Reduce Their Emissions.** According to the Center For
    American Progress, "On November 14, 2022, the U.S. Department of
    Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration proposed to require certain
    federal contractors to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and
    climate-related financial risks and set science-based targets to
    reduce their greenhouse gas emissions." \[Center For American
    Progress,

the bill for the Environmental Protection Agency to prepare or
promulgate any regulation or guidance referencing analysis contained in
certain documents published by the White House council on environmental
quality and by interagency working groups on the social cost of carbon
and greenhouse gases." The vote was on adoption of the amendment. The
House rejected the amendment by a vote of 189-243. \[House Vote 386,

2022, which would "provide funding for various activities to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, promote energy-efficient technologies and
mitigate the impacts of climate change, including \$27 billion for
grants to state, local and nonprofit entities for greenhouse gas
emission reduction activities; \$9.7 billion for zero-emission or carbon
capture rural electric systems; \$5 billion for loan guarantees to
replace or reduce emissions of energy infrastructure; \$3 billion for
zero-emission vehicles for the Postal Service; and \$1.6 billion for
methane emissions reduction and mitigation." The vote was on a motion to
