# Energy Tax Credits

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For The FY 2020 Minibus Appropriations Bill,
Which Did Not Include Tax Breaks Supporting Renewable Energy.** In
December 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for the FY 2020 minibus spending bill,
which represented 8 of the 12 appropriations bills. According to the
Washington Post, "A majority of House Democrats supported creating or
extending tax breaks --- lawmakers' favorite tool for supporting
renewable energy --- for solar energy, offshore wind turbines, electric
vehicles and big batteries. But almost none of those tax credits made it
into the final deal. Democrats say the week began with a tentative
agreement between both parties that contained several of those clean
energy provisions. But the White House objected to their inclusion,
Democrats said, so they were pulled from the final deal to avoid a
government shutdown before the holidays." The vote was a motion to
concur in the Senate amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote
of 297-120. The Senate later passed the bill and the President signed
the bill into law. \[House Vote 689,

-   **Washington Post: The Oil Industry "Vigorously Lobbied" Against Tax
    Breaks For Renewable Energy.** According to the Washington Post, "In
    particular, the oil and natural gas industry, a major ally of
    President Trump, vigorously lobbied against an expansion of a tax
    break for buyers of cars that need little to no gasoline to run.
    Democrats say the Trump administration decided to side with the oil
    sector over General Motors and other automakers, which had mounted
    their own campaign in Congress this year to save the dwindling tax
    credit for electric vehicles." \[Washington Post,
