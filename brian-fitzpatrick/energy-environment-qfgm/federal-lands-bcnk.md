**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Disapproving A Rule That Changed The
Bureau Of Land Management Procedures For Resource Management Plans.** In
February 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a resolution that would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "disapproves the Resource
Management Planning rule issued by the Interior Department on Dec. 12,
2016 (commonly known as Planning 2.0), which modifies the Bureau of Land
Management's process for developing resource management plans for public
lands. The measures provides that the rule will have no force or
effect." The vote was on the legislation. The House agreed to the

-   **The Rule Was An Attempt For The BLM To Address A Wider Variety Of
    Issues, Including Wildfire Risks And The Appropriate Demand For
    Renewable Energy Sources; Rule Also Emphasized Using High Quality
    Data.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The final rule is
    intended to more readily address a wider variety of issues and
    possible impacts, including wildfire risk, wildlife habitat,
    appropriate development or the demand for renewable and
    non-renewable energy sources. It emphasizes the role of using
    high-quality information in the planning process, including the best
    available scientific information, and the importance of evaluating
    resource, environmental, ecological, social and economic conditions
    at the outset of planning." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/3/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5034970/9?7)\]

-   **Supporters Of The Rule Argued That The Rule Will Make BLM Provide
    A More Holistic Approach To Resource Management.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents of the resolution, mainly
    Democrats, say the rule will provide a more holistic approach to BLM
    resource management planning and allow the agency to respond to
    critical environmental, economic and social changes in a timely
    manner. They praise provisions intended to gather more information
    at the outset of a project and to work more closely with local
    communities in an open and transparent manner, saying it will help
    create more resilient public lands and habitats in the face of
    climate change. The rule, they say, effectively gives the public a
    better seat at the table in managing public lands." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [2/3/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5034970/9?7)\]

-   **Rule Updated Decades Old Guidelines; Because A CRA Prevents
    Similar Rules In The Future, The Old Rules Would Remain In Place.**
    According to The Hill, "Conservation groups and most Democrats
    support the rule, saying it would update decades-old guidelines
    within the Interior Department and disputing GOP claims that it
    would diminish input from individuals and local governments.  In a
    letter to lawmakers on Monday, 13 groups noted that CRA resolutions
    prevent agencies from writing similar rules in the future, meaning
    BLM's management policies could be frozen for years. \[...\] 'If
    Congress wants to return to a system that was plagued with lawsuits,
    conflict, and the outsized influence of big oil companies then this
    is the way to go. If they want to maintain a system that allows for
    both energy development and protecting public lands, then they
    should keep Planning 2.0.'" \[The Hill,

and the U.S. Geological Survey. Through 2022, it would reauthorize
several programs related to wildlife conservation, invasive species
management, and prevention of illegal poaching and trafficking. The bill

regulation, exchange, and management of federal public lands and
forests. It would make additions and boundary adjustments to several
national parks, monuments, and historic sites. It would authorize and

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Allow The Transfer Of Federal Lands To
State And Tribal Groups To Have No Cost From A Budget Scoring
Perspective.** In January 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for House rules that
would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "effectively
shield\[ed\] from Congressional Budget Office scoring any legislation
that would require or authorize the conveyance of federal land to a
state, local government or tribal entity. By not requiring the budget
analysis, the affected legislation wouldn\'t need offsets or budgetary
pay-fors that can trip up a lands bill before it hits the House floor.
According to the provision, land transfers 'shall not be considered as
providing new budget authority, decreasing revenues, increasing
mandatory spending, or increasing outlays.'" The vote was on the
resolution. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 234 to 193.

-   **Federal Land Can Generate Receipts, Including Potential Land
    Sales.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Federal land can
    generate receipts from a variety of sources, including natural
    resources like coal or timber on the land, from activities such as
    grazing and utility right-of-way fees and from potential land sales
    from an authorized federal agency." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [1/3/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/news-5011968?1&srcpage=news&srcsec=cqn)\]

-   **Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-AZ): "This Proposed Rule Change Would
    Make It Easier To Implement This Plan By Allowing The Congress To
    Give Away Every Single Piece Of Property We Own, For Free, And
    Pretend We Have Lost Nothing Of Any Value."** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "House Democrats, led by Natural Resources
    ranking member Raúl M. Grijalva, D-Ariz., called foul on the
    proposal, saying it is 'outrageous and absurd' that Congress would
    give away federal land 'for free.' 'This proposed rule change would
    make it easier to implement this plan by allowing the Congress to
    give away every single piece of property we own, for free, and
    pretend we have lost nothing of any value,' Grijalva said in a
    statement. 'Not only is this fiscally irresponsible, but it is also
    a flagrant attack on places and resources valued and beloved by the
    American people.' Grijalva said local governments are unlikely to
    have the necessary resources to effectively manage the land, and
    this type of transfer would lead to state land sales. 'The proposal
    is one more example of the Trump Republicans' plans to use federal
    resources to enrich wealthy developers by making it easier for them
    to get their hands on invaluable federal lands currently owned by,
    and open to, all Americans,' Grijalva said." \[Congressional
    Quarterly,

### National Monuments

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Requiring National Monuments
Receive Congressional Approval.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted
against a budget resolution that would in part, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget
authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by
reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total
discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would
assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal
2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or
terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010
health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's
Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would
require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S.
Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the
budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget
resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281.

-   **Budget Called For Effectively Gutting Presidential Authority To
    Create National Monuments By Requiring They Receive Congressional
    Approval.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018
    Budget, "Reform the Antiquities Act The Antiquities Act of 1906 was
    enacted to give the president authority to protect archeological
    sites from looting. Like other unchecked powers given to the
    executive branch, this authority has been abused. President Obama
    has used the Antiquities Act to remove 533 million additional acres
    of land and water from productive use, more than any other
    president.437 Because a national monument designation imposes strict
    restrictions on land use, the Antiquities Act can hurt local
    economies that rely on logging, mineral development, energy
    creation, or recreational activities on the federal land. Further,
    ever-growing federal land holdings spread the resources to manage
    those holding too thin, resulting in the neglect and mismanagement
    of land that often results in destruction of the environments
    proclamations were intended to protect. Before an area is designated
    as a national monument, the designation should be approved by an act
    of Congress." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed
