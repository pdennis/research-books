### Subsidies

Caucus's Budget Resolution, Which Among Other Things, Increased Taxes On
The Rich And Corporations And Called For Closing Loopholes And Subsidies
For Coal, Oil And Natural Gas.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted
against an FY 2018 CPC budget resolution. According to Congressional
Quarterly, the resolution would "provide for \$3.8 trillion in new
budget authority in fiscal 2018, not including off-budget accounts. It
would raise overall spending by \$3.5 trillion over 10 years and would
increase revenues by \$8.2 trillion over the same period through
policies that would increase taxes for corporations and high-income
individuals. It would repeal the Budget Control Act sequester and caps
on discretionary spending, would modify the tax code by adding five
higher marginal tax rates, would create a public insurance option to be
sold within the current health insurance exchanges and would call for
implementation of comprehensive immigration overhaul." In addition,
according to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, "Closes tax loopholes
and ends subsidies provided to oil, gas and coal companies." The
amendment was a substitute amendment for the GOP's FY 2018 budget
resolution in part designed to start the process for tax reform. The
House rejected the amendment by a vote of 108 to 314. \[House Vote 553,
