### Air Quality Standards

**2020: Fitzpatrick Voted For Maintaining Strict Air Standards For
Soot.** In July 2020, Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment to the FY 2021
four-bill appropriations package that would, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "prohibit the use of funds provided by the bill to enforce an
April 30, 2020, EPA rule related to air quality standards for
particulate matter." The vote was on adoption. The House adopted the
amendment by a vote of 233-176. \[House Vote 163,

-   **The Amendment Reverses An EPA Rule Implemented In April That
    Rolled Back Regulations On Soot.** According to Roll Call, the
    amendment "would cut off funding for the EPA to finish and implement
    a regulation it proposed in April, when it decided not to require
    more stringent air standards for fine particulate matter, sometimes
    referred to as soot. Democrats argued that not implementing stricter
    soot standards is a disservice to Americans and would
    disproportionally affect communities of color." \[Roll Call,

-   **Republicans Backed The EPA Rule, Stating It Used "Solid Science,"
    And Claimed The Requirements Are Already Burdensome To Some
    States.** According to Roll Call, "GOP lawmakers argued the EPA's
    review of the current standard uses solid science and its process of
    reviewing more than 66,000 public comments on the proposed rule
    should be allowed to continue unimpeded by Congress. 'There are
    already too many states and counties struggling to meet the current
    standards,' said Rep. David Joyce, R-Ohio, the ranking member on the
    Interior-Environment Subcommittee." \[Roll Call,

### Pollution

**2025: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Disapproving An EPA Rule That
Established Emissions Standards For Rubber Processing In Tire
Manufacturing.** In March 2025, Fitzpatrick voted against , according to
Congressional Quarterly, "the joint resolution that would provide for
congressional disapproval of, and nullify, an EPA final rule which
established National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants
(NESHAP) for rubber processing in tire manufacturing. The joint
resolution would nullify the regulation, but disapproval of the rule
would leave in place existing emissions standards for the other three
phases of manufacturing rubber tires." The vote was on passage. The
House passed the bill by a vote of 216 to 202. \[House Vote 58,

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted Against An Amendment That Would Repeal The Law
That Mandates State Governors To Deter Or Eliminate Air Pollutants That
Endanger Public Health Or Welfare.** In March 2023, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted against an amendment to the
Lower Energy Costs Act, which would "repeal current law that requires
state governors to prevent or eliminate air pollutants emitted in their
states that the EPA determines endanger public health or welfare in a
foreign country, if certain conditions are met." The vote was on the
adoption of an amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of
96 to 336. \[House Vote 173,
