database to track individuals receiving SNAP benefits. The bill would
reauthorize and extend supplemental agricultural disaster assistance
programs, the current sugar policies and loan rates, several
international food aid programs, nonrecourse marketing assistance loans
for loan commodities, several dairy programs, including the dairy risk
management program (previously the margin protection program) and would
modify certain utility standards in the Home Energy Assistance Program
to require SNAP benefits recipients to provide documentation of such
expenses in order to receive increased benefits using the Standard
Utility Allowance. The bill would authorize, with modifications, the
farm risk-management program, which gives agriculture producers a choice
of receiving price loss coverage or agriculture risk coverage, on a
covered-commodity-by-covered-commodity basis, for the 2019 through 2023
crop years. The bill would reauthorize several conservation programs,
and would increase the conservation reserve program from 24 to 29
million acres and reduce from 750,000 to 500,000 acres the cap for
Farmable Wetland Program enrollment. It would also increase the amount
authorized annually for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program for
the 2019 through 2023 crop years, with a maximum authorization of \$3
billion in 2023. It would eliminate the conservation stewardship program
and would also allow the Environmental Protection Agency to determine

designated threatened or endangered species, or the habitat of such a
species, without having to consult with federal agencies." The vote was

-   **Legislation Gave The EPA The Authority To Delay Protections

    EPA The Authority To Delay Protections Against Pesticides. "Secretly
    Delaying EPA Pesticide Protections. State pesticide regulatory
    agencies often are closely allied with the agricultural chemical
    corporations. The bill provides these agencies a secret chance to
    slow or effectively veto EPA pesticide protections before they
    become public or are even proposed. The bill requires that before
    EPA can propose or finalize any pesticide rules, state pesticide
    agencies must be notified, provided a chance to object or argue
    against the rules, and EPA must respond before moving ahead with any
    action---a formula for delay and possible death of the rules through
    secretive political pressure." \[NRDC,

Evaluation Act, which would "authorize \$3 million in fiscal 2023 for

polyfluoroalkyl substances. It would specify that one agreement would
direct a study on research and knowledge gaps identified at the 2020
Federal Government Human Health PFAS Research Workshop. The National
Science Foundation, in addition to the EPA, would enter into the second
agreement, which would direct a study on the research and development
needed to advance the understanding of human and environmental
contamination by PFAS, including strategies for PFAS treatment and safe
alternatives to the chemicals. It would require both agreements to be
reached within 90 days of the appropriation of funds, and the National
Academies\' reports to be submitted to Congress within 540 days of the
agreements being finalized. It would direct the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy, within 180 days of the reports\'
submission, to submit to Congress a plan to coordinate federal PFAS
research, development and demonstration activities." The vote was on

finalize a military specification for PFAS firefighting agent by January
2023, and it prohibits their use in firefighting after October 2023. It
also imposes a complete ban on fluorinated foams on military
installations by October 2024, although the department may extend the

projects. Among other provisions, it would reauthorize the Economic
Development Administration within the Commerce Department for five years
through fiscal 2029. The measure also would redistribute unobligated
Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act funds to states
through the Surface Transportation Block Grant program. It also would

-   **Bill Opponents Noted That The Current Rules Have Not Been A
    Hindrance And That The Current Rule Protects Water Quality.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents of the bill,
    primarily Democrats, argue that the Obama administration\'s EPA
    rules have been in place for five years without any of the predicted
    dire effects. They point out that farmers and forestry operators
    have been able to grow crops successfully under the rule and that
    public health officials have been able to deal with threats of
    mosquito-borne illness, including continuing concerns regarding
    Zika, as effectively as they did before the rule. EPA and the
    states, they say, have received few if any complaints of the rule
    interrupting regular agriculture operations, and they argue that the
    current permitting requirements are critical to ensure that the
    nation\'s water quality is protected --- which improves health
    outcomes for everyone." \[Congressional Quarterly,
