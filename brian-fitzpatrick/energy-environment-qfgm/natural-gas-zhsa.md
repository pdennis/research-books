    resources on federal land within their borders, and stopping the
    federal government from implementing any hydraulic fracturing
    regulations in a state that has already issued its own regulations."

    Quarterly, "Prior to the release of the proposed rule, the
    department produced a technical support document that said 20 of 21

    Quarterly, "It would also prohibit the department from determining
    that an energy conservation standard for kitchen ranges or ovens is

    United States based on what type of fuel it consumes."

against an amendment to the Save Our Gas Stoves Act, which would "strike

Stove Protection and Freedom Act, which would "prohibit the Consumer
Product Safety Commission from using federal funds to regulate gas
stoves as banned hazardous products or to impose any consumer product

-   **The Rule Requires That Oil And Gas Producers Use The Most Current
    Technology And Process To Cut Flaring In Half, Inspect Their
    Operations For Leaks And Limit Venting From Storage Tanks.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "As part of Obama's climate
    plan, the Interior Department sought to reduce the release of
    natural gas into the atmosphere from oil and gas operations on
    public and Indian lands by updating existing regulations on venting,
    flaring and leaks of natural gas. \[...\] The final rule, which was
    issued Nov. 18, 2016, requires oil and gas producers to use
    currently available technologies and processes to cut flaring in
    half at oil wells on public and tribal lands. Operators must also
    periodically inspect their operations for leaks and replace outdated
    pieces of equipment that vent large quantities of gas into the air.
    It also requires operators to limit venting from storage tanks, use
    best practices to limit gas losses when removing liquids from wells
    and restores the government\'s flexibility to set royalty rates at
    or above 12.5% of the value of production." \[Congressional

    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents of the resolution,
    mainly Democrats, say that even though the United States is the
    largest producer of natural gas in the world, Americans have not
    benefited from the full potential of this energy resource because of
    venting, flaring and leaks of significant quantities of gas during
    the production process. They say that enough natural gas was lost
    between 2009 and 2015 to serve more than 6 million households a
    year, which, according to the Government Accountability Office
    (GAO), means states, tribes and federal taxpayers lose millions of
    dollars annually in royalty revenue due the federal government and
    the states that share it. The rule is an important step in both
    protecting the environment and in reducing associated problems

    extremely hazardous gas with a 'rotten egg' smell. It occurs
    naturally in crude petroleum and natural gas, and can be produced by
    the breakdown of organic matter and human/ animal wastes (e.g.,
    sewage). It is heavier than air and can collect in low-lying and

    irritation of eyes, nose, throat, or respiratory system; effects can
    be delayed. Moderate concentrations -- more severe eye and
    respiratory effects, headache, dizziness, nausea, coughing, vomiting
