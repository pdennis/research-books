### Diesel Emissions Reduction

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For Reauthorizing The Diesel Emissions
Reduction Act.** In September 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that
would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "reauthorize \$100 million
annually through fiscal 2024 for EPA programs under the Diesel Emissions
Reduction Act that provide grants and loans to retrofit diesel vehicles
to meet emission standards." The vote was on a motion to suspend the
rules and pass the bill. The House passed the bill by a vote of 295-114.
