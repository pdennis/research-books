# Alternative Energy, Generally

### Funding

**2020: Fitzpatrick Voted For A \$135 Billion Spending Package On
Renewable Energy Programs.** In September 2020, Fitzpatrick voted for
the Expanding Access to Sustainable Energy Act that would, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "authorize Energy Department activities and
programs related to renewable and alternative energy, energy efficiency,
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and energy infrastructure and
workforce development. It would authorize or reauthorize a wide range of
DOE research and development programs through fiscal 2025, including to
authorize over \$5.5 billion for programs related to renewable energy
technologies, including solar, wind, geothermal and water power; \$3.5
billion for programs to modernize and improve the national electric
grid; a number of carbon reduction programs, including \$3.2 billion for
a carbon storage program; and a number of nuclear energy programs,
including \$174 million to support the availability of high-assay low
enriched uranium \[...\] It would require all federal agencies to assess
public health impacts of proposed actions that may affect communities
disproportionately impacted by environmental hazards; require the EPA to
take actions to identify disproportionate health and environmental
effects on communities of color and low-income communities; and
authorize \$5 billion through fiscal 2025 for grants to local
governments or nonprofits for environmental justice projects." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 220-185. The
Senate did not take action on the bill. \[House Vote 206,

-   **The Bill Funded Programs To Boost Energy Efficiency And Renewable
    Energy Sources To Combat Climate Change.** According to The Hill,
    "The House on Thursday passed a broad bill that aims to boost energy
    efficiency and renewable energy sources as part of an attempt to
    combat climate change. \[...\] The legislation would create research
    and development programs for solar, wind, advanced geothermal energy
    and hydroelectric power as well as lessening pollution from fossil
    fuel production." \[The Hill,

-   **The White House Issued A Veto Threat For The Bill.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The White House budget office issued a
    veto threat on Monday against the bill and Republicans criticized
    the legislation, arguing it would raise electricity costs and delay
    permitting for new energy projects." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [9/24/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6014915?11)\]

-   **Republicans Argued That The Bill Would Raise Electric Costs For
    Americans.** According to The Hill, "'The top Republicans on the
    National Resources, Energy and Commerce and Transportation and
    Infrastructure Committees released a joint statement criticizing the
    legislation this week. 'Here we are in the middle of a global
    pandemic and Speaker Pelosi wants to spend more than \$135 billion
    on a piece of legislation that will never become law,' said Reps.
    Rob Bishop (R-Utah), Greg Walden (R-Ore.), and Frank Lucas
    (R-Okla.). 'This bill is chock-full of government mandates that
    would raise what Americans pay for everything from the vehicles they
    drive to what they pay to heat, cool, and power their homes.'" \[The

**2020: Fitzpatrick Voted For Increasing Funding For The Efficiency And
Renewable Energy Division At The DOE By 50 Percent.** In September 2020,
Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment to a renewable energy package that
would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "increase energy efficiency
and renewable energy funding authorization levels by 50% annually
through fiscal 2025 for Energy Department research and development
activities related to solar, wind, and water energy. It also would add
authorization totals for research, development, demonstration, and
commercialization activities under the Energy Department\'s Office of
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy through fiscal 2025, authorizing
\$3.2 billion in fiscal 2021 increasing incrementally to \$3.4 billion
in fiscal 2025." The vote was on adoption. The House adopted the
amendment by a vote of 235-173. \[House Vote 203,
