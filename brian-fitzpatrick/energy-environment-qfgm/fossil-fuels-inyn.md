    According to Politico, "In its statement of administration policy
    opposing the bill, the White House noted that both domestic oil and
    gas production are set to reach record highs this year as companies
    have responded to last year's high prices to bring more supply to
    the market. Gasoline prices have come down from record highs since
    the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year but they
    could be set to rise again this summer during peak driving season."
