of at least 99 years. It would allow D.C. to develop and use the campus
for stadium purposes, including training facilities and offices;
commercial and residential development; facilities, open space and
public outdoor opportunities; and demolition purposes to facilitate
development. However, it would stipulate that for D.C. to move forward
with development, it must follow certain guidelines, including providing
parking facilities, public safety and security measures and reducing the
impact of noise and traffic. It would stipulate that D.C. would be
responsible for paying any costs associated with transferring the
administrative jurisdiction. It would require the jurisdiction to revert
to the department if the terms of the bill have not been complied with
and not been corrected within 90 days of a written notice of
