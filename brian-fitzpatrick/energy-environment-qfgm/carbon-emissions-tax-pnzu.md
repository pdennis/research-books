# Carbon Emissions Tax

### Imposing Taxes And Fees On Carbon Emissions

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Rejecting The Carbon Tax.** In March
2024, Fitzpatrick voted against , according to Congressional Quarterly,
"the concurrent resolution (H Con Res 86) that would express the sense
of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to U.S. families and
business and is not in the best interest of the country. The measure
would also state that a carbon tax would reduce America's global
competitiveness and instead encourage development abroad in countries
that have not imposed a similar tax." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the concurrent resolution by a vote of 222 to 196. \[House Vote
