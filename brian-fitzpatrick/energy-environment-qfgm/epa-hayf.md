-   **"Backstop Actions" Is The Highest Level Of EPA Assistance In
    Ensuring Pollutant Limits Are Met.** According to the EPA, "Each
    time the EPA assessed the Phase I and Phase II WIPs, it determined
    whether the jurisdiction would achieve its goals on its own or
    whether the EPA needed to take additional actions to assist the
    jurisdiction in meeting its goals using three levels of increasing
    action. Under the lowest level, Ongoing Oversight, the EPA continues
    to monitor the jurisdiction's progress. Under next level, Enhanced
    Oversight, the EPA has identified specific concerns with meeting the
    2025 goals and may identify one or more federal actions it may use
    to keep the jurisdiction on track. The highest level, Backstop
    Actions, indicates that the EPA has identified substantial concerns
    with a jurisdiction's implementation and that the Agency has taken
    federal actions to ensure the WIP stays on track." \[EPA,

### Disapproving Methane Emission Rule

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted To Disapprove A September 2020 Environmental
Protection Agency Rule That Rescinded Methane Emissions Standards.** In
June 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for a joint resolution which would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for congressional
disapproval of a September 2020 Environmental Protection Agency rule
that reversed 2012 and 2016 rules establishing emission standards \-- or
new source performance standards \-- to limit the amount of methane and
volatile organic compounds that can be released in the production,
processing, transportation and storage of oil and natural gas.
Specifically, the 2020 rule rescinded the methane-specific standards and
rescinded the applicability of all standards to transportation and
storage activities. The rule also required the EPA, before promulgating
new air pollutant standards, to determine that the pollutant causes or
contributes significantly to dangerous air pollution. The rule took
effect on September 14, 2020. Under the provisions of the joint
resolution, the 2020 rule would have no force or effect, and the
Obama-era emission standards would be effectively reinstated." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the joint resolution by a vote of
229-191, thus the resolution was sent to the President and it ultimately
became law. \[House Vote 185,

    Methane Missions, A Byproduct For Natural Gas Drilling That Is
    Responsible For A Fourth Of The "World's Warming Since The 1800s,"
    With A Weaker Standard In August 2020.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The Senate voted Wednesday to revive an Obama-era rule
    to limit the emissions of methane, a highly potent heat-trapping gas
    byproduct of drilling for natural gas that is responsible for about
    one-quarter of the world's warming since the 1800s. By a vote of
    52-42, the Senate passed a joint resolution (S J Res 14) to
    reinstate a rule the EPA put in place in 2016 before the Trump
    administration rescinded it and implemented a weaker standard in
    August of last year." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [4/28/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6206874?8)\]

-   **The Reinstated Obama-Era Rule Would Require Oil And Gas Companies
    To Observe For Any Methane Leaks And Fix Faulty Equipment.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Once reactivated, the EPA
    rule would require oil and gas companies to monitor for methane
    leaks at their facilities and repair faulty equipment."

-   **The Amendment Reenacted "Emergency" Affirmative Defense Positions
    For Stationary Sources Of Air Pollution.** According to the
    Environmental Protection Agency, On June 3, 2016, the EPA proposed
    "to align its operating permits program with requirements for air
    emissions limits set under other Clean Air Act programs. This
    proposal would remove 'emergency' affirmative defense positions from
    the title V operating permit program regulations." \[Environmental
    Protection Agency, [Accessed

    Protection Agency (EPA) --- \$17 million more than comparable FY
    2018 funding and \$2.7 billion (30%) more than requested after
    accounting for \$62 million in rescissions. Of the total, \$791
    million represents a separate, additional appropriation for EPA
    elsewhere in the agreement outside of the regular EPA accounts for
    water infrastructure and other purposes; excluding that funding, net
    EPA funding would total \$8.1 billion, equal to FY 2018."

Levels, Including A \$763 Million Increase For The EPA.** In March 2018,
Fitzpatrick voted for the FY 2018 Omnibus spending bill. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "Combined, the spending measures would provide
about \$1.3 trillion in discretionary spending, with \$1.2 trillion
subject to discretionary spending caps, and \$78.1 billion designated as
Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The measure\'s spending levels
are consistent with the increased defense and non-defense budget caps
set by the two-year budget deal agreed to last month. That agreement
increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80 billion and the non-defense
cap by \$63 billion. Given that the previous caps were set to reduce
overall discretionary spending by \$5 billion, the net increase provided
by the omnibus is \$138 billion over the FY 2017 level." The vote was on
the motion to concur in the Senate Amendment with an Amendment. The
House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 256

### PFAS

**2020: Fitzpatrick Was Absent During A Vote On Strengthening EPA
Regulation Of Per- And Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS).** In January
2020, Fitzpatrick missed a vote on the PFAS Action Act that would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "require the Environmental
Protection Agency to issue a number of regulations and take certain
actions to address the impacts of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances.
Specifically, it would require the EPA to designate certain PFAS \--
perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, as well as perfluorooctane
sulfonic acid and its salts \-- as hazardous chemicals under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act."
The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 247-159.

    hazardous substance is released into the air, land or water in
    amounts exceeding the threshold, it triggers an investigation and
    potential cleanup. By contrast, when a substance is simply a
    'pollutant or contaminant,' it must be shown to pose an 'imminent

    chemicals that have been designated as 'hazardous substances' and
    things that are merely considered 'pollutants or contaminants.'
    Under current law, PFAS chemicals are considered 'pollutants or

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Prohibiting The EPA From Making Rules
Unless The Rule Is Based On Research That Is Entirely Publically
Available.** In March 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against prohibiting the
EPA from making rules unless the all the rule is based on research that
is entirely publically available. According to Congressional Quarterly,
the bill would have "prohibit\[ed\] the EPA from proposing, finalizing
or disseminating a rule, regulation or standard unless the scientific
and technical information on which the EPA's decisions relied is
publicly available for independent analysis. It would \[have\]
require\[d\] any personally identifiable information, trade secrets or
sensitive business information to be redacted prior to the publication
of the scientific information." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the legislation by a vote of 228 to 194. The Senate took no
substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 206,

-   **The Bill Requires The EPA To Release All Materials Necessary To
    Understand Its Conclusions.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Specifically, EPA must release all materials, data and associated
    protocols necessary to understand and assess the conclusions made by
    the agency; computer codes and models used in the creation and
    analysis of such information; recorded factual materials; and
    detailed descriptions of how to access and use such information. Any
    personally identifiable information, trade secrets, or commercial or
    financial information must be redacted prior to being made publicly

    information.'" \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Bill Opponents, Mostly Democrats Claimed That The Legislation
    Would Prevent The EPA From Using Data That Is Kept Sealed Due To
    Confidentially Agreements, Thereby Compromising The Quality Of The
    Agencies' Work.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents,
    mostly Democrats, argue that the bill imposes burdensome and costly
    requirements that would effectively block EPA from using many
    important research studies and thereby compromise the quality of its
    work by forcing it to rely on less scientific data. The bill, they
    say, is based on a false premise: that EPA relies on secret research
    to make its decisions. While some nonpublic research is used, EPA
    relies mostly on research that has been published in respected
    journals after rigorous peer review, a formal process in which
    experts review the research and have the opportunity to question and
    challenge the author's data and assumptions. Valuable nonpublic
    research used by EPA is also peer-reviewed and adds significantly to
    EPA's knowledge base to make decisions, even though confidentiality
    agreements prevent EPA from publicly releasing the research."

-   **Supporters Of The Bill, Mostly Republicans, Believed That The EPA
    Regulatory Process Is Both Hidden And Flawed.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Bill supporters, mostly Republicans, argue
    that the underlying regulatory process at EPA is both hidden and
    flawed. If the EPA has nothing to hide, and if its data justifies
    its regulations, then the agency should make the information public,
    they say. Major regulations proposed by EPA routinely have been
    justified by nontransparent data and unverifiable claims, and the
    bill would correct that by simply requiring the underlying data to
    be made public --- a policy consistent with the data access
    requirements of major scientific journals, the White House
    Scientific Integrity Policy and the recommendations of independent
    groups. They say Americans affected by EPA regulations have a right
    to see the data and determine for themselves whether the agency\'s
    actions are based on sound science or a partisan agenda."

### Science Advisory Board

**2015: Fitzpatrick Voted Against A Bill That Would Modify The Selection
And Qualification Process For The EPA's Science Advisory Board.** In
March 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a bill that would modify the
qualifications and selection process for the EPA's Science Advisory
Board. According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill would, "establish
a selection process for members of the EPA's Science Advisory Board. The
bill would require the board\'s members represent a variety of
scientific and technical viewpoints. It would require board member
nominees to disclose financial relationships that would be relevant to
EPA advisory activities. It would require the board to generally avoid
making policy determinations or recommendations to the EPA." The vote
was on passage and the House passed the bill 236 to 181. The Senate took
no substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 208,

-   **The EPA's Science Advisory Board, Established In 1978, Is To
    Advise The Agency And Interested Congressional Committees; Board
    Requires At Least Nine Members, Appointed By The EPA Administrator
    For Three Year Terms.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    Science Advisory Board within the Environmental Protection Agency
    (EPA) was established in 1978 by the Environmental Research,
    Development, and Demonstration Authorization Act \[...\] to provide
    scientific advice to the agency and interested congressional
    committees as requested. According to the EPA, the board's mission
    includes reviewing the quality and relevance of the scientific and
    technical information being used or proposed as the basis for agency
    regulations; reviewing research programs and the technical basis of
    applied programs; reviewing generic approaches to regulatory
    science, including guidelines governing the use of scientific and
    technical information in regulatory decisions, and critiquing such
    analytic methods as mathematical modeling; advising the agency on
    broad scientific matters in science, technology, social and economic
    issues; and advising the agency on emergency and other short-notice
    programs. \[...\] The 1978 act establishing the board requires a
    minimum of nine members who are appointed by the EPA administrator
    to serve a three-year term and may be reappointed for a second term;
    currently, the board contains 51 members. There are no statutory
    guidelines governing the selection process for board members."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/17/15](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-4642197/8?6&search=2PvszEm4)\]

-   **Opponents Of The Bill Claimed It Would Place "Industry-Funded
    Scientists" On The EPA's Advisory Panel "At The Expense Of
    Independent Scientists."** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Bill opponents, primarily Democrats, argue that it is a veiled
    attempt to get industry-funded scientists on EPA's science advisory
    panel at the expense of independent scientists from academic and
    research institutions. The additional requirements that the bill
    demands of the board are designed to keep it from getting anything
    accomplished, they say, especially since it contains no additional
    resources for the board to function. Additionally, opponents argue
    that the bill requires the EPA to treat scientists who conduct
    EPA-funded research, and who may have had a past contractual
    relationship with the agency, as having a financial conflict of
    interest while at the same time loosening the financial
    conflict-of-interest standards for industry-funded experts. The
    bill, they say, will skew the composition of the Science Advisory
    Board and, in the process, diminish the sound science and good
    judgment that EPA and the public have come to rely on."

### Truck Emissions Rule

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Disapproving An EPA Rule That Imposed
Stricter Emissions Standards On Heavy-Duty Vehicles.** In May 2023,
according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted against a joint
resolution that would "provide for congressional disapproval of the
January 2023 EPA rule imposing more stringent emissions standards on
heavy-duty engines and vehicles. The rule requires heavy-duty vehicles,
starting in model year 2027, to comply with reduced emissions limits of
nitrogen oxides and other pollutants, both in real-world conditions and
laboratory-tested scenarios. It would also lengthen the period during
the engine\'s operational life when the reduced emissions standard must
be met. According to the EPA, the rule will reduce nitrogen oxide
emissions from heavy-duty trucks by almost 50 percent by 2045. The EPA
rule took effect on March 27, 2023. Under the joint resolution, the rule
would have no force or effect." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the resolution by a vote of 221 to 203, thus the resolution was
sent to the President. President Biden vetoed the resolution. The Senate
failed override the veto, thus the veto was sustained. \[House Vote 232,

    in December, requires heavy- and medium-duty vehicles to meet the
    more stringent nitrogen oxide emission standards beginning in model
    year 2027. The EPA said the update, the first in over two decades,
    would reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by heavy-duty truck fleet by

    would allow manufacturers to commercialize the technology by 2027
    and that there would be larger costs to public health if the
