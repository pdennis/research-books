# State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)

### 2018 Extension

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For A February 2018 Two-Year Budget Deal
Which, Among Other Things, Increased Spending By \$300 Billion,
Suspended The Debt Ceiling, Extended CHIP's Authorization For Four More
Years And Extended Numerous Tax Breaks.** In February 2018, Fitzpatrick
voted for a two-year budget deal that re-opened the government after a
brief shutdown. According to the New York Times, "With Mr. Trump's
signature, the government will reopen before many Americans were aware
it had closed, with a deal that includes about \$300 billion in
additional funds over two years for military and nonmilitary programs,
almost \$90 billion in disaster relief in response to last year's
hurricanes and wildfires, and a higher statutory debt ceiling." In
addition, according to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation "would
provide funding for federal government operations and services at
current levels through March 23, 2018 \[...\] \[and\] retroactively
extends numerous tax breaks that expired at the end of 2016. It also
extends the CHIP program for another four years (through FY 2027) and
funds community health centers for another two years." The vote was on a
motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the
bill. The House agreed to the motion, essentially on passage, by a vote
of 240 to 186. The bill was then sent to the president, who signed it
into law. \[House Vote 69,

-   **January Continuing Resolution Had Already Extended CHIP Through
    2023.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The agreement
    authorizes the Children's Health Insurance Program for an additional
    four years, through FY 2027, providing 'such sums as are necessary'
    from FY 2024 through FY 2026 and \$15.3 billion in FY 2027 to be
    provided in two semi-annual allotments. The January CR Extension
    that funded the government through Feb. 8 (PL 115-120) extended CHIP
    funding for six years, through FY 2023." \[Congressional Quarterly,

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For An FY 2018 Continuing Resolution Funding
The Government Through February 8 And Reauthorized CHIP For Six Years.**
In January 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for legislation that would have,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] funding for federal
government operations and services at current levels through Feb. 8,
2018. The measure would \[have\] fund\[ed\] the state Children's Health
and Insurance Programs at \$21.5 billion annually starting in fiscal
2018 and would gradually increase the funding annually through fiscal
2023." In addition, also according to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill
also suspends or delays for one or two years three health-related taxes
that were enacted as part of the 2010 health care overhaul to help
finance the law --- the medical device tax, the tax on high-value
employer-sponsored health insurance plans (the so-called 'Cadillac'
tax), and annual fees on health insurance companies." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 266 to 150. The Senate
had already agreed to the version of the bill. President Trump later
signed it into law. \[House Vote 44,

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For An FY 2018 Continuing Resolution Funding
The Government Through February 16 And Reauthorized CHIP For Six Years,
But Did Not Offer Any Fixes For DACA Recipients.** In January 2018,
Fitzpatrick voted for legislation that would have, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] funding for federal government
operations and services at current levels through Feb. 16, 2018, at an
annualized rate of \$1.23 trillion for federal departments and agencies
covered by the 12 unfinished fiscal 2018 spending bills, of which an
annualized rate of \$621.5 billion would be designated for defense and
an annualized rate of \$511 billion for nondefense discretionary
spending. The measure would \[have\] fund\[ed\] the state Children's
Health and Insurance Programs at \$21.5 billion annually starting in
fiscal 2018 and would gradually increase the funding annually through
fiscal 2023." In addition, also according to Congressional Quarterly,
"The bill suspends or delays three health-related taxes that were
enacted as part of the 2010 health care overhaul to help finance the law
--- the medical device tax, the tax on high-value employer-sponsored
health insurance plans (the so-called 'Cadillac' tax), and annual fees
on health insurance companies." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 230 to 197. The Senate later blocked the
bill, shutting down the government for three days. A revised version of
the legislation, funding the government through February 8th was later
signed into law. \[House Vote 33,

### Funding

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted Against A Recession Spending Package That
Cancelled \$14.8 Billon In Approved Spending, Including \$7 Billion In
CHIP Funding And \$4.3 Billion In Funding From The Energy Department's
Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program.** In June 2018,
Fitzpatrick voted against a recession package. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "Passage of the bill that would cancel
approximately \$14.8 billion in previously approved spending, including
reductions in budget authority for mandatory programs. It would rescind
allocated funding across various departments and programs, including \$7
billion from the Children's Health Insurance Program, \$4.3 billion from
the Energy Department's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan
Program, \$683 million from Innovative Technology Loan Guarantees, and
\$800 million in mandatory funding from the Center for Medicare and
Medicaid Innovation. It would not rescind any of the funding provided by
the fiscal 2018 omnibus appropriations measure." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 210 to 206. The Senate
later rejected the bill. \[House Vote 243,

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Reauthorizing CHIP And
Combining Its Funding With Medicaid Into A Single Block Grant.** In
October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a budget resolution that would
in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9
trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the
budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10
years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for
fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations
funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate
funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would
assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert
Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block
grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social
Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be
included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House
GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of
139 to 281. \[House Vote 555,

-   **Budget Called For Combining CHIP And Medicaid Into A Block Grant
    And Called For Reducing The Expanded CHIP Grant Level From The
    ACA.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget,
    "The RSC budget would extend federal SCHIP funding through FY 2019
    as part of a larger state block grant, but provide the enhanced
    SCHIP matching rate only for state coverage of families with incomes
    at or below 200 percent FPL. The budget would eliminate federal
    financial participation for state coverage of families making more
    than 300 percent of the FPL. This will enable states to return their
    SCHIP program's focus to accomplishing SCHIP's primary mission:
    providing high quality health care coverage to vulnerable low income
    children. Additionally, by fully repealing Obamacare, this budget
    would repeal Obamacare's 23 percent increase to federal SCHIP
    matching payments. SCHIP had been hailed as a success by bipartisan
    governors and Members of Congress before Obamacare, when the federal
    share of SCHIP payments ranged between 65 and 85 percent.
    Nevertheless, Obamacare increased this range to 88 and 100 percent,
    superseding the need for states to contribute to their own programs
    in a dozen states." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed
