**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For The \$1.3 Trillion FY 2018 Omnibus
Spending Deal Which Raised Spending By \$138 Billion Over FY 2017
Levels, Including A \$3.0 Billion Increase In NIH Funding.** In March
2018, Fitzpatrick voted for the FY 2018 Omnibus spending bill. According
to Congressional Quarterly, "Combined, the spending measures would
provide about \$1.3 trillion in discretionary spending, with \$1.2
trillion subject to discretionary spending caps, and \$78.1 billion
designated as Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The measure\'s
spending levels are consistent with the increased defense and
non-defense budget caps set by the two-year budget deal agreed to last
month. That agreement increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80 billion
and the non-defense cap by \$63 billion. Given that the previous caps
were set to reduce overall discretionary spending by \$5 billion, the
net increase provided by the omnibus is \$138 billion over the FY 2017
level." The vote was on the motion to concur in the Senate Amendment
with an Amendment. The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the
bill, by a vote of 256 to 167. The Senate later agreed to the
