### Stockpile

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted For Authorizing Through FY 2024 \$705 Million
Annually To Strengthen The National Strategic Stockpile, \$500 Million
Annual For A Supply Chain Manufacturing Pilot Program, And \$3.5 Billion
Annually For A Pilot Grant Program To Aid States Maintain Strategic
Stockpiles Of Medical Supplies.** In October 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for
the Strengthening America's Strategic National Stockpile Act which
would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "authorize funding for and
require the Health and Human Services Department to take actions to
strengthen the National Strategic Stockpile. Through fiscal 2024, it
would authorize \$705 million annually for the stockpile to maintain
drugs, vaccines, medical devices and other medical supplies to provide
for national emergency health security needs; \$500 million annually for
a new supply chain flexibility manufacturing pilot program to improve
domestic reserves of critical medical supplies; and \$3.5 billion
annually for a new pilot grant program to help states expand or maintain
strategic stockpiles of medical supplies. Among other provisions, it
would require HHS to ensure that contents of the stockpile are in good
working order, submit a report to Congress every 30 days on all state
and local requests for supplies related to the COVID-19 pandemic and
improve processes for the use and distribution of supplies from the
stockpile." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote
of 397-22. \[House Vote 322,

    would be used to maintain the supply and ensure the items are
    working so they can be distributed to states when necessary."
