**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The American Health Care Act That
Would Eliminated Prevention And Public Health Fund.** In May 2017,
Fitzpatrick voted against the American Health Care Act which would have
significantly repealed portions of the Affordable Care Act by cutting
Medicaid, cutting taxes on the rich, removing safeguard for pre-existing
conditions and defunding Planned Parenthood. According to CNN, "Public
health advocates are warning lawmakers the GOP plan to repeal Obamacare
will eliminate nearly \$1 billion in Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention funding used for programs like preventing disease outbreaks
and childhood lead poisoning. But Republican critics say the Prevention
and Public Health Fund, which amounts to 12% of CDC\'s budget, is a
'slush fund' that has been spent on Zumba classes and massage sessions.
Their proposal includes a new fund that they say provides states 'broad
flexibility' to address local health concerns. The Republican bill would
eliminate the fund, created under the Affordable Care Act, which has
grown from a small slice of the CDC budget to providing \$931 million
last year." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote
of 217 to 213. The bill, in modified forms, died in the Senate. \[House

-   **Director Of The Big Cities Health Coalition Chrissie Juliano: The
    Fund Funds Vaccines For The Flu, Measles, Mumps, Track Emergence Of
    Diseases Like Zika And Ebola, And Address Foodborne Illnesses Such
    As Salmonella.** According to Chrissie Juliano, director of the Big
    Cities Health Coalition, "At the macro level, the Prevention and
    Public Health Fund supports and fights a multitude of health threats
    that do not respect state or national borders. Immunization programs
    supported by the fund ensure access to vaccines that protect the
    most vulnerable among us from routine diseases like the flu, and
    recently re-occurring ones like mumps or measles. The fund also
    supports the ability to track outbreaks of recently emerged diseases
    like Zika or Ebola, but also routine foodborne illnesses, like
    Salmonella. Without these dollars provided by the Affordable Care
    Act, CDC's ability to protect the health and safety of Americans
    will be dramatically reduced. And our collective ability to address
    the next big public health threat will put us at risk." \[Chrissie

    And Respond To Diseases Like The Flu.** According to CNN, "CDC\'s

    to detect, prevent and respond to health threats including pandemic
    flu." \[CNN,
