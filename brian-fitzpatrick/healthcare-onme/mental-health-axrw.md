### School Behavioral Intervention Teams

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted To Establish Behavioral Interventional Teams
In Schools And Require HHS And Stakeholders To Provide Technical
Assistance When Schools Start Implementation.** In May 2021, Fitzpatrick
voted for the Behavioral Intervention Guidelines Improvement Act of 2021
which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require the Health
and Human Services Department to develop best practices for schools to
establish and train behavioral intervention teams to identify and
address behavioral health issues, including best practices to avoid
inappropriate use of mental health assessments, impeding law enforcement
proceedings and endangering students\' privacy. It would require the
department to coordinate with relevant stakeholders in developing best
practices and provide technical assistance to schools for
implementation." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 323-93. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill.
