# Medicaid And CHIP

### Income Eligibility

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted To Exclude Classification As Income For
Particular Pandemic-Related Unemployment Compensation For Medicaid And
CHIP Eligibility.** In March 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for a bill which
would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "exclude certain
pandemic-related unemployment compensation from being classified as
income for the purposes of Medicaid and Children\'s Health Insurance
Program eligibility." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill
by a vote of 246-175, sent to the Senate and President and ultimately
became law. \[House Vote 96,

Congressional Actions, [H.R.
1868](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1868/actions)\]

-   **H.R. 1868 Would Ensure Hospitals That Serve A Higher Number Of
    Uninsured Patients Are Not Punished For Receiving Additional
    Financial Aid.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill
    also would make several other changes to the aid law, including a
    correction aimed at ensuring that hospitals serving a
    disproportionate share of uninsured patients are not penalized for
    receiving additional aid." \[Congressional Quarterly,
