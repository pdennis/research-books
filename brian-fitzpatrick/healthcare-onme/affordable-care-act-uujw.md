### Cadillac Tax

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For The FY 2020 Minibus Appropriations Bill,
Which Repealed The Cadillac Tax.** In December 2019, Fitzpatrick voted
for the FY 2020 minibus spending bill, which represented 8 of the 12
appropriations bills. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill
permanently repeals three major health industry taxes that were imposed
under the 2010 healthcare overhaul to help pay for Obamacare.
Specifically, it repeals the so-called 'Cadillac Tax' on expensive
employer-provided health insurance plans provided by wealthy companies
and major labor unions, and also repeals a 2.3% tax on medical devices
and an annual health insurance fee." The vote was a motion to concur in
the Senate amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of
297-120. The Senate later passed the bill and the President signed the
bill into law. \[House Vote 689,

-   **CBO: The Repeal Of The Cadillac Tax Would Cost \$377 Billion In
    Lost Revenue Over Ten Years.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "The Cadillac tax in particular was intended both to pay for
    Obamacare and to help 'bend the cost curve' of spiraling healthcare
    costs by encouraging individuals to insist on lower cost plans. CBO
    estimates the repeals would cost \$377 billion in lost revenue over
    ten years." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Politico: Repealing The Cadillac Tax "All But Guts The Funding
    Provisions" For The ACA.** According to Politico, "Congress
    preserved a moratorium on the 'Cadillac' tax until 2022 \[...\] The
    move all but guts the funding provisions for the Affordable Care
    Act, with the Cadillac tax repeal alone projected to cost nearly
    \$200 billion." \[Politico,

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For Repealing The "Cadillac Tax".** In July
2019, Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that would, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "repeal the 40 percent excise tax, known as the
'Cadillac tax' on the incremental costs of employer-sponsored health
care plans above certain thresholds. The tax was imposed by the 2010
health care overhaul and is currently set to take effect at the
beginning of 2022." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and
pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 419-6.

-   **The Cadillac Tax Was Enacted As A Key Way TO Pay For The
    Affordable Care Act.** According to Congressional Quarterly, the
    bill "Would permanently repeal the 40 percent excise tax on
    high-cost employer-provided health insurance, which was envisioned
    as a key way to pay for the 2010 health care law." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [12/16/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5795161?25)\]

-   **Congressional Quarterly: Without Offsets To Pay for The Repeal, It
    Could Cost \$1 Trillion By The 2030s, Which "Makes Health Economists
    Shudder."** According to Congressional Quarterly, "the prospect of
    repeal, especially without offsets to pay for it, makes health
    economists shudder. The Congressional Budget Office projected in May
    that rolling back the excise tax would cost \$193 billion between
    2019 and 2029. Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on
    Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote this week that could reach \$1
    trillion in the 2030s." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [7/12/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5593274?22)\]

-   **Congressional Quarterly: The Repeal Was A "Top Priority For The
    Insurance Industry."** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "There's bipartisan support in both the House and Senate for its
    repeal and it has been a top priority for the insurance industry and
    labor unions." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [7/12/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5593274?22)\]

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For A \$100 Billion Tax Bill That Delayed ACA
Taxes, Included Tax Relief For Disaster Victims And Offered Fixes For
The 2017 Tax Reform Bill.** In December 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for
legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"provide\[d\] tax relief to individuals and businesses who have been
harmed by certain natural disasters during 2018 and \[...\] \[made\] it
easier for small businesses to offer retirement savings plans for their
employees while also giving individuals greater flexibility to
contribute to and use funds from their retirement accounts. It also
allow\[ed\] churches and other non-profits to become politically active
while maintaining their tax-exempt status; delay\[ed\] or repeal\[ed\]
four taxes created by the 2010 health care overhaul to finance that law;
\[made\] certain modifications and technical corrections to the 2017 tax
overhaul; and modernize\[d\] the IRS to improve customer service and
help prevent identity theft and tax return fraud." The vote was on a
motion to concur in the Senate amendment with a further House amendment.
The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of
220 to 183. The bill died in the Senate. \[House Vote 470,

-   **Bill Delayed The Cadillac Tax For From Starting In 2022 To 2023.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The \[Cadillac\] tax was
    originally to be implemented for calendar year 2018, but like the
    medical device tax was delayed by the December 2015 omnibus/tax
    extenders package (for two years) and January 2018 CR and is
    currently set to begin Jan. 1, 2022. The bill delays the so-called
    'Cadillac tax' for an additional year, until Jan. 1, 2023."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [12/19/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5434052?6)\]

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For An FY 2018 Continuing Resolution Funding
The Government Through February 8 And Delayed The Cadillac Tax For Two
Years.** In January 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for legislation that would
have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] funding for
federal government operations and services at current levels through
Feb. 8, 2018. The measure would \[have\] fund\[ed\] the state Children's
Health and Insurance Programs at \$21.5 billion annually starting in
fiscal 2018 and would gradually increase the funding annually through
fiscal 2023." In addition, also according to Congressional Quarterly,
"The bill also suspends or delays for one or two years three
health-related taxes that were enacted as part of the 2010 health care
overhaul to help finance the law --- the medical device tax, the tax on
high-value employer-sponsored health insurance plans (the so-called
'Cadillac' tax), and annual fees on health insurance companies." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 266 to 150.
The Senate had already agreed to the version of the bill. President
Trump later signed it into law. \[House Vote 44,

    Congressional Quarterly, "The measure delays for an additional two
    years, until the start of 2022, the health care law\'s tax on
    certain high-value employer-sponsored health insurance plans. Under
    the 2010 health care law, that tax was initially scheduled to go
    into effect in 2018 but was delayed for two years (until the start
    of 2020) by the FY 2016 omnibus appropriations/tax extenders package
    enacted in December 2015." \[Congressional Quarterly,

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For An FY 2018 Continuing Resolution Funding
The Government Through February 16 And Delayed The Cadillac Tax For Two
Years, But Did Not Offer Any Fixes For DACA Recipients.** In January
2018, Fitzpatrick voted for legislation that would have, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] funding for federal government
operations and services at current levels through Feb. 16, 2018, at an
annualized rate of \$1.23 trillion for federal departments and agencies
covered by the 12 unfinished fiscal 2018 spending bills, of which an
annualized rate of \$621.5 billion would be designated for defense and
an annualized rate of \$511 billion for nondefense discretionary
spending. The measure would \[have\] fund\[ed\] the state Children's
Health and Insurance Programs at \$21.5 billion annually starting in
fiscal 2018 and would gradually increase the funding annually through

on health insurance companies." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 230 to 197. The Senate later blocked the
bill, shutting down the government for three days. A revised version of
the legislation, funding the government through February 8th was later
signed into law. \[House Vote 33,

### Cost-Sharing Subsidies

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The American Health Care Act That
Would Have In Part Repealed Cost-Sharing Subsidies In 2020.** In May
2017, Fitzpatrick voted against the American Health Care Act which would
have significantly repealed portions of the Affordable Care Act by
cutting Medicaid, cutting taxes on the rich, removing safeguard for
pre-existing conditions and defunding Planned Parenthood. According to
the Kaiser Family Foundation, "ACA cost sharing subsidies are repealed
effective January 1, 2020." The overall legislation would have in part
"ma\[d\]e extensive changes to the 2010 health care overhaul law, by
effectively repealing the individual and employer mandates as well as
most of the taxes that finance the current system. It would \[have\], in
2020, convert\[ed\] Medicaid into a capped entitlement that would
provide\[d\] fixed federal payments to states and end\[ed\] additional
federal funding for the 2010 law's joint federal-state Medicaid
expansion. It would prohibit federal funding to any entity, such as
Planned Parenthood, that performs abortions and receives more than \$350
million a year in Medicaid funds. \[...\] It would \[have\] allow\[ed\]
states to receive waivers to exempt insurers from having to provide
certain minimum benefits." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 217 to 213. The bill, in modified forms, died in the
Senate. \[House Vote 256,

### Expansion

**2020: Fitzpatrick Voted For Strengthening The ACA By Expanding Access
To Health Insurance And Medicaid.** In June 2020, Fitzpatrick voted for
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act that would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "include a number of provisions to
expand enrollment in and reduce consumer costs for state- and
federally-operated Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplaces;
incentivize Medicaid expansion by states; and authorize maximum price
negotiations for prescription drugs under Medicare. Title I of the bill
would expand eligibility for federal tax subsidies toward insurance
premiums and increase the percentage of premiums such subsidies would
cover. It would provide \$10 billion annually beginning in fiscal 2022
to help states lower costs of ACA plans, including to provide
reinsurance payments to health insurance issuers and subsidies to
individuals. It would provide \$200 million for grants to states to
establish and operate state-based ACA health insurance marketplaces;
\$100 million annually for Health and Human Services Department consumer
outreach related to ACA marketplace plans; \$100 million annually for
the HHS \"navigator\" program, which helps individuals enroll in
qualified plans; and \$200 million annually through fiscal 2024 for
grants to states to encourage plan enrollment. It would also prohibit
implementation of August 2018 regulations related to health insurance
plans that are not required to meet ACA patient protection requirements,
including short-term, limited-duration plans. Title II of the bill would
provide for full federal reimbursement of state Medicaid expansion costs
for new enrollees for three years, then gradually decrease the federal
medical assistance cost-share to 90% for those enrollees." The vote was
on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 234-179. \[House Vote

-   **The Bill Expanded ACA Eligibility, Incentivized States To Expand
    Medicaid, And Allowed Medicare To Negotiate Drug Prices.** According
    to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill would make more people
    eligible for federal financial assistance to purchase health
    insurance, incentivize states to expand Medicaid eligibility and
    allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. It is not expected to be
    taken up in the Republican-controlled Senate." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [6/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5942619?2)\]

-   **The Bill Reduced Federal Funding For The 14 States Who Have Not
    Expanded Medicaid.** According to the Washington Post, "The
    legislation would place financial pressure on states that have not
    expanded Medicaid \[...\] The ACA originally expanded Medicaid
    nationwide, but a 2012 Supreme Court ruling, in which justices
    upheld the law's constitutionality, gave each state the choice of
    whether to expand Medicaid. For 14 states that have not expanded the
    program, the bill would reduce federal funding for traditional
    Medicaid. It would also add an inducement, paying for the entire
    initial cost of an expansion --- as the law did when expansions
    first were allowed in 2014." \[Washington Post,
    [6/29/20](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/house-democrats-push-through-first-bill-in-a-decade-expanding-affordable-care-act/2020/06/29/350d3046-ba0f-11ea-8cf5-9c1b8d7f84c6_story.html)\]

-   **By Eliminating The 400 Percent Threshold, The Bill Mandated That
    No One Would Be Required To Pay More Than 8.5% Of Their Income On
    Popular Marketplace Health Plans.** According to the Washington
    Post, "Under \[the ACA\], federal insurance marketplaces and similar
    state ones opened in 2014 for individuals and families who cannot
    get affordable health benefits through a job. The law provides
    federal subsidies for insurance premiums for those with incomes up
    to 400 percent of the federal poverty level --- about \$51,000 for
    an individual and nearly \$105,000 for a family of four. The bill
    would eliminate the 400 percent threshold, saying for the first time
    that no one would be required to pay more than 8.5 percent of their
    income on the most popular tier of marketplace health plans."
    \[Washington Post,
    [6/29/20](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/house-democrats-push-through-first-bill-in-a-decade-expanding-affordable-care-act/2020/06/29/350d3046-ba0f-11ea-8cf5-9c1b8d7f84c6_story.html)\]

-   **The Bill Included A Long-Sought After Provision For Democrats
    Allowing Federal Health Officials To Negotiate The Price Of Drugs
    Under Medicare.** According to the Washington Post, "The bill also
    includes a longtime Democratic goal of allowing federal health
    officials to negotiate the price of drugs under Medicare, the vast
    federal insurance program for older and disabled Americans. Trump
    used to support that idea but turned against it." \[Washington Post,
    [6/29/20](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/house-democrats-push-through-first-bill-in-a-decade-expanding-affordable-care-act/2020/06/29/350d3046-ba0f-11ea-8cf5-9c1b8d7f84c6_story.html)\]

-   **CBO: The Bill Would Reduce Deficits And Spending In Future Decades
    And Increase The Number Of Insured Americans By 4 Million.**
    According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB),
    "According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the coverage
    provisions would cost \$586 billion over a decade while the drug
    provisions would save \$582 billion and interactions would save \$23
    billion. Overall, the bill would be fully paid for over a decade
    (\$18 billion of net deficit reduction) and would likely reduce
    deficits and spending in future decades. CBO estimates the bill
    would reduce the number of uninsured by 4 million people per year
    and reduce pre-subsidy (but post-reinsurance) non group premiums by
    about 10 percent." \[CRFB,

-   **Democrats Passed The Health Care Bill Days After The Trump
    Administration Asked The Supreme Court To Rule The Law
    Unconstitutional.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House
    passed, 234-179, on Monday legislation to enhance the 2010 health
    care law, days after the Trump administration asked the Supreme
    Court to scrap it \[...\] Democrats hope to contrast their plans to
    expand the health care law with the administration's efforts to
    overturn the law ahead of the November election, in which health
    care is expected to be a top issue for voters." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [6/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5942619?2)\]

-   **Democrats Emphasized The Importance Of Health Care Access During
    The COVID-19 Pandemic.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Democrats also have sought to underscore the significance of the
    law during the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has sickened
    millions and led to millions of job losses. As some Americans lost
    their jobs, they also lost their employer-sponsored health
    insurance. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a
    report last week that found about 487,000 consumers signed up for a
    marketplace plan during a special enrollment period after losing
    their workplace coverage this year, an increase of 46 percent
    compared to the same time period last year." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [6/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5942619?2)\]

-   **Republicans Opposed The Partisan Nature Of The Bill And Stated
    That The Drug Pricing Conditions Would Make It Harder To Develop New
    Treatments.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Republicans
    argued that Democrats should instead work on a bipartisan fashion to
    improve the health care system. They said the drug pricing
    conditions in the measure would make it more difficult to develop
    new cures and treatments, which are needed even more with the new
    coronavirus." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/29/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5942619?2)\]

-   **Both Senate Republicans And The White House Opposed The Bill,
    Making It Nearly Impossible For The Bill To Become Law.** According
    to the Washington Post, "The 234-179 vote, almost entirely along
    party lines, was a hollow exercise in terms of any chance the bill
    would become law and reshape federal health policy. Moments after
    the debate began, the White House announced the president would veto
    the legislation if it reached his desk, though a wall of Senate
    Republican opposition to the measure makes that a moot point."

### Federal Subsidies

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Extending Tax Subsidies Toward
Affordable Care Act Insurance Premiums For Eligible Individuals Through
2025.** In August 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted against concurring in the Senate amendment to the
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which would "extend through 2025 tax
subsidies toward Affordable Care Act marketplace insurance premiums for
individuals under a certain income level." The vote was on a motion to
concur. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote 220-207, thus the
bill was sent to President Biden for final signage. President Biden
signed the bill and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 420,

-   **The Inflation Reduction Act Included \$64 Billion To Prevent
    Health Insurance Premium Increases For Approximately 13 Million
    Americans Who Purchased Policies Through The Affordable Care Act
    Marketplace.** According to The Washington Post, "The bill also
    includes \$64 billion to stave off health insurance premium
    increases for about 13 million Americans who buy coverage through
    state and federal exchanges under the Affordable Care Act." \[The
    Washington Post,
    [8/7/22](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/08/07/senate-inflation-reduction-act-climate/)\]

-   **Individuals Covered Under The Affordable Care Act Received A
    Discounted Price Under A Coronavirus-Era Program, Which Was Expected
    To Expire In Late 2022.** According to The Washington Post, "These
    beneficiaries currently receive discounted coverage under a
    coronavirus-era program set to expire this year, threatening them
    with premium increases into hundreds of dollars next month." \[The
    Washington Post,
    [8/7/22](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/08/07/senate-inflation-reduction-act-climate/)\]

-   **The Inflation Reduction Act Provided A Three-Year Extension On
    Federal Health Care Subsidies In The Affordable Care Act, Which
    Retained Premiums At \$10 Per Month Or Less For The Majority Of The
    People Covered By The ACA.** According to NPR, "There's also a
    three-year extension on healthcare subsidies in the Affordable Care
    Act originally passed in a pandemic relief bill last year, estimated
    by the government to have kept premiums at \$10 per month or lower
    for the vast majority of people covered through the federal health
    insurance exchange. That helps millions of Americans avoid spikes in
    their health care costs." \[NPR,

### Federal Tax Subsidies Towards Marketplace Insurance Premiums

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Extending Expanded Eligibility For Tax
Credits Through 2025 For Affordable Care Act Marketplace Insurance
Premiums.** In November 2021, Fitzpatrick voted against the Build Back
Better act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "establish

### Health Insurance Fee

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For A \$100 Billion Tax Bill That Delayed ACA
Taxes, Included Tax Relief For Disaster Victims And Offered Fixes For
The 2017 Tax Reform Bill.** In December 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for
legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly,

employees while also giving individuals greater flexibility to
contribute to and use funds from their retirement accounts. It also
allow\[ed\] churches and other non-profits to become politically active
while maintaining their tax-exempt status; delay\[ed\] or repeal\[ed\]
four taxes created by the 2010 health care overhaul to finance that law;
\[made\] certain modifications and technical corrections to the 2017 tax
overhaul; and modernize\[d\] the IRS to improve customer service and
help prevent identity theft and tax return fraud." The vote was on a
motion to concur in the Senate amendment with a further House amendment.
The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of
220 to 183. The bill died in the Senate. \[House Vote 470,

-   **The ACA's Health Insurance Fee, Which Is Set To Return In 2020,
    Would Instead Be Suspended Until 2022 Under The Bill.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The 2010 law imposed an annual flat fee on
    the health insurance industry, starting at \$8 billion in 2014 and
    growing to \$14.3 billion in 2018, after which it would be adjusted
    by the same rate as the growth in health insurance premiums. Fees on
    individual insurers are based on the net amount of premiums written
    the year before, as well as the insurers' market share. The fee was
    imposed for 2014, 2015 and 2016 but it was suspended for calendar
    year 2017 by the December 2015 omnibus/tax extenders package. After
    being imposed again in 2018, Congress through the January 2018 CR
    suspended it for calendar year 2019. It is currently set to return
    for calendar year 2020. The measure suspends the annual fee on
    health insurance providers for an additional two years --- for
    calendar years 2020 and 2021 --- so that it wouldn't return until
    2022." \[Congressional Quarterly,

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For An FY 2018 Continuing Resolution Funding

Feb. 8, 2018. The measure would \[have\] fund\[ed\] the state Children's
Health and Insurance Programs at \$21.5 billion annually starting in

fiscal 2023." In addition, also according to Congressional Quarterly,
"The bill also suspends or delays for one or two years three
health-related taxes that were enacted as part of the 2010 health care
overhaul to help finance the law --- the medical device tax, the tax on
high-value employer-sponsored health insurance plans (the so-called
'Cadillac' tax), and annual fees on health insurance companies." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 266 to 150.

Fitzpatrick voted against an amendment that would have, according to

using funds appropriated by the bill to enforce certain health insurance
requirements." The underlying bill was an FY 2019 Interior, Environment
and Financial Services appropriations bill. The House adopted the

    Bill Through 2024.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    medical device tax imposes a 2.3% excise tax on a wide array of
    devices that are often used in hospitals and doctors' offices. The
    tax is imposed on the sale of devices in the United States by the

    devices. It applies to any device intended for humans --- but does
    not include eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids or other retail
    devices available for purchase by the general public and not
    primarily intended for use in a medical institution or office. The
    tax initially went into effect in 2013 and was suspended for 2016
    and 2017 by the FY 2016 omnibus appropriations/tax extenders package
    enacted in December 2015 (PL 114-113). The Further Appropriations
    Act for FY 2018 (PL 115-120) enacted in January 2018 suspended the
    tax for an additional two years, through the end of calendar

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The American Health Care Act That
Would Have In Part Repealed The Medical Device Tax.** In May 2017,
Fitzpatrick voted against the American Health Care Act which would have
significantly repealed portions of the Affordable Care Act by cutting
Medicaid, cutting taxes on the rich, removing safeguard for pre-existing
conditions and defunding Planned Parenthood. According to the Kasier
Family Foundation, the legislation had the "ACA taxes repealed,
effective January 1, 2017, except where otherwise noted: \[...\] \[The\]
Excise tax on sale of medical devices." The overall legislation would
have in part "ma\[d\]e extensive changes to the 2010 health care
overhaul law, by effectively repealing the individual and employer
mandates as well as most of the taxes that finance the current system.
It would \[have\], in 2020, convert\[ed\] Medicaid into a capped
entitlement that would provide\[d\] fixed federal payments to states and

### Navigator Program

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against An Amendment To The FY 2020 Minibus
That Would Have Cut Funding To Health Insurance Navigators To Help
Eligible Consumers Enroll In Medicaid.** In June 2019, Fitzpatrick voted
against a bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "strike
from the bill the requirement that the Health and Human Services
secretary obligate \$100 million in fiscal 2020 for a health insurance
marketplace navigator program, including specified obligation for
advertising." The vote was on adoption of the amendment. The House
rejected the amendment by a vote of 186-237. \[House Vote 284,

-   **The Trump Administration Cut Funding For The Navigator Program
    From \$63 Million To \$10 Million.** According to the Kaiser Family
    Foundation, "Since taking office, the Trump administration has
    dramatically reduced funding for federal marketplace Navigators. The
    Affordable Care Act (ACA) created Navigator programs to provide
    outreach, education, and enrollment assistance to consumers eligible
    for marketplace and Medicaid coverage and requires that they be
    funded by the marketplaces. As recently as 2016, the Centers for
    Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provided \$63 million in
    funding per year for Navigator programs in federally facilitated
    marketplace (FFM) states. In 2017, however, CMS reduced federal
    Navigator funding to \$36.1 million, then reduced funding again in
    2018 to \$10 million. The Trump administration has also reduced
    funding for outreach outside of navigator programs by 90%." \[Kaiser

### Pre-Existing Conditions

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For Health Care Legislation That Was Designed
To Bring More Generic Drugs To The Marketplace, Restore Funding To
Promote ACA Plans, Fund States To Create Their Own State-Based ACA
Exchanges, And Stop A Trump Administration Rule Increasing Eligibility
For Short-Term Insurance Plans That Do Not Comply With ACA Rules, Such
As Protections For Pre-Existing Conditions.** In May 2019, Fitzpatrick
voted for the MORE Health Education Act. According to Congressional
Quarterly, "\[t\]his bill includes a number of provisions intended to
lower the price of prescription drugs by helping to bring generic and
biosimilar drugs to market more quickly, and it seeks to bolster
enrollment in Affordable Care Act marketplaces by restoring funding to
promote ACA health plans and help individuals find affordable plans
while also providing funding for states to establish their own
state-operated health insurance marketplaces (rather than relying on the
existing federal marketplace). In addition, it revokes a Trump
administration rule that expands the availability of short-term health
plans that don't have to comply with ACA consumer protections, such as
protections for individuals with preexisting conditions." The vote was
on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 234 to 183. \[House

-   **Short-Term Insurance Plans Do Not Have To Comply With ACA
    Requirements, Such As Pre-Existing Conditions, They Can Charge More
    Based On Gender Or Age, And Can Impose Lifetime Or Annual Limits.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill prohibits the Health
    and Human Services, Treasury and Labor departments from taking any
    action to implement, enforce or otherwise give effect to the
    regulation entitled 'Short-Term, Limited Duration Insurance' that
    was issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid on August 1,
    2018, and it prohibits the departments from developing any
    substantially similar rule. Short-term, limited duration insurance
    plans are outside the ACA and do not have to comply with the ACA's
    patient protection requirements. Consequently, insurers selling such
    plans may charge higher premiums based on health status or other
    factors such as gender or age, may exclude coverage for preexisting
    conditions and for other categories of benefits such as prescription
    drugs, and may impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits. Such
    plans traditionally have been considered emergency health insurance
    intended to provide coverage for periods when an individual might be
    between jobs or recently unemployed. The Obama administration in
    2016 issued a rule that limited the duration of such plans to three
    months, but the Trump administration's August 2018 rule allows that
    insurance to be effective for almost one year --- with such coverage
    eligible to be extended for up to 3 years total." \[Congressional

### Premiums, Generally

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted To Prevent HHS And Treasury From Doing
Anything That Would Make Health Care Premiums More Expensive For Health
Insurance As Comprehensive As The ACA's With Essential Health
Benefits.** In May 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment that would
have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit\[ed\] the Health
and Human Services and Treasury departments from taking any action that
would result in increased health insurance premiums for individuals
enrolled in health insurance at least as comprehensive as the
\"essential health benefits package\" defined under the 2010 health care
law." The underlying legislation would have, also according to
Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] the Trump administration to
rescind a 2018 guidance that made it easier for states to change their
individual insurance markets and bypass the 2010 health care law.
\[...\] In October, the administration released a guidance to give
states more flexibility by exempting them from some of the waiver
requirements. The administration later suggested ways states could
change their insurance markets, including revising the rules for
consumers to qualify for premium subsidies, allowing those subsidies to
go toward plans that don't comply with all of the 2010 law's regulations
or setting up high-risk pools or reinsurance programs to help cover the
most expensive patients." The vote was on the amendment. The House
passed the amendment by a vote of 308 to 112. The House later passed the
underlying bill. \[House Vote 194,

-   **The Trump Administration Has Significantly Cut Funding For ACA
    Navigators -- Individuals Who Would Help People Find ACA Coverage;
    The Legislation Appropriated \$100 Million Per Year For
    Navigators.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Starting in
    2017, as part of an effort to dismantle and replace the ACA, the
    Trump administration reduced funding for the navigators and
    shortened the amount of time the health insurance exchanges were
    open for annual enrollment and re-enrollment. The administration
    also reduced advertising of the open enrollment period. That funding
    was further reduced in 2018, with \$10 million being provided for
    navigators (versus \$63 million in 2016) and \$10 million for public
    education and outreach (versus \$100 million in 2016). The bill
    provides \$100 million per year for the ACA navigator program,
    starting FY 2020 (with the funds to be obligated from amounts
    collected through the user fees from participating health insurance
    providers), and it appropriates \$100 million a year for consumer
    outreach and education activities." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/10/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5534992/17?4&search=4QggTqwN)\]

-   **Funding For States To Set Up Their Own ACA Exchanges Expired In
    2014; The Legislation Would Give Grants Through 2022.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The bill appropriates \$200 million to
    allow states to establish their own state-based health insurance
    exchanges (prior federal funding under the ACA for states to
    establish their own exchanges ended after 2014). The funding would
    be provided to states in the form of grants for a period of two
    years; grants could not be renewed, and no grant could be awarded
    after Dec. 31, 2022. Grants can only be made to states that do not
    yet have a state-based exchange, and states must ensure that
    exchanges are self-sustaining starting Jan. 1, 2024. State-based
    exchanges could charge assessments or user fees to participating
    health insurance issuers (currently, health insurers offering plans
    through an exchange are charged a user fee of 3% on state exchanges
    and 3.5% on the federal exchange)." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/10/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5534992/17?4&search=4QggTqwN)\]

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For Restoring Funding For ACA Marketplace
Promotion, Funding For States To Create State-Based Exchanges, And
Stopping A Trump Rule That Allows People To Get Junk Short-Term
Insurance That Does Not Include ACA Requirements Such As Pre-Existing
Conditions Protections.** In May 2019, Fitzpatrick voted against an
amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"remove\[d\] from the bill Title II, which contains several provisions
that would facilitate enrollment in and support Affordable Care Act
health insurance marketplaces." Also according to Congressional
Quarterly, "\[t\]he bill includes a number of provisions that seek to
bolster enrollment in Affordable Care Act marketplaces by restoring
funding to promote ACA health plans and help individuals find affordable
health care plans, while also providing funding for states to establish
their own state-operated health insurance marketplaces (rather than
relying on the existing federal marketplace). It also revokes a Trump
administration rule that expands the availability of short-term health
plans that don't have to comply with ACA consumer protections, such as
protections for individuals with preexisting conditions. Increasing the
number of individuals who purchase ACA-compliant plans through the ACA's
state exchanges would broaden the insurance risk pool and help reduce
the cost of ACA health insurance." The underlying legislation included
provisions designed to lower prescription drugs and shored up the ACA.
The vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a
vote of 189 to 230. \[House Vote 210,

### Protection

**2020: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Amendment To The Six-Bill FY 2021
Appropriations Package That Prevented The Justice Department From
Bringing Suit Against The ACA.** In July 2020, Fitzpatrick voted for an
amendment to the FY 2021 six-bill appropriations package that would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit the use of funds
provided by the bill for the Justice Department to argue in any
litigation that the provisions of the 2010 health care law and certain
related provisions are unconstitutional or invalid on any grounds." The
vote was on adoption. The House adopted the amendment by a vote of

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted To Prohibit The Justice Department To

voted for an amendment that would, according to Congressional Quarterly,

### Public Option

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Congressional Progressive
Caucus's Budget Resolution, Which Among Other Things, Increased Taxes On
The Rich And Corporations And Called For Creating A Public Option In The
ACA's Marketplace.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against an FY
2018 CPC budget resolution. According to Congressional Quarterly, the
resolution would "provide for \$3.8 trillion in new budget authority in
fiscal 2018, not including off-budget accounts. It would raise overall
spending by \$3.5 trillion over 10 years and would increase revenues by
\$8.2 trillion over the same period through policies that would increase
taxes for corporations and high-income individuals. It would repeal the
Budget Control Act sequester and caps on discretionary spending, would
modify the tax code by adding five higher marginal tax rates, would
create a public insurance option to be sold within the current health
insurance exchanges and would call for implementation of comprehensive
immigration overhaul." The amendment was a substitute amendment for the
GOP's FY 2018 budget resolution in part designed to start the process
for tax reform. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 108 to
314. \[House Vote 553,

### Repeal

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted To Direct The Office Of The General Counsel Of
The House To Represent The House In The Texas ACA Case Which Overturned
The Entire ACA.** In January 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for rules for the
116th Congress. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Adoption of the
resolution that would establish the rules of the House for the 116th
Congress. Title III of the resolution would authorize the speaker, on
behalf of the House of Representatives, to intervene in the Texas court
case that found the 2010 healthcare law unconstitutional and other cases
related to the law. It would also direct the Office of General Counsel
to represent the House in any such litigation." The House passed the
resolution by a vote of 235 to 192. \[House Vote 19,

-   **In December, A Federal Judge Overturned The Entire ACA Due To The
    2017 Tax Law.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House
    adopted on Wednesday, 235-192, a resolution to intervene in a
    lawsuit challenging the 2010 health care law, although Democrats
    already filed a motion last week to do just that. The resolution (H
    Res 6) would allow lawyers for the House to join a coalition of
    Democratic state attorneys general in defending the health care law
    (PL 111-148, PL 111-152) in a lawsuit brought by Texas and other
    conservative state officials. The Democrats are essentially
    repeating action they took last week in an effort to emphasize their
    support of the pre-existing condition protections in the health law.
    Wednesday's vote on Title III of the resolution, the House
    Democrats' rules package for this Congress, follows votes last week
    to approve the other parts of the rules package. The third section
    of the rules package is similar to another resolution (H Res 14) by
    freshman Rep. Colin Allred, D-Texas. Another part of the resolution,
    which the House adopted last week, authorized the House general
    counsel to file to become a party in the case. The vote Wednesday on
    the third section, which includes additional justification for why
    the House should intervene and background on the case, offers
    Democrats another chance to put Republicans on record voting against
    the popular pre-existing condition protections. The Trump
    administration declined to defend those protections. A federal judge
    ruled in favor of the conservative states last month, saying the law
    should fall after Republicans acted in 2017 to end the penalty for
    not having insurance coverage. California Attorney General Xavier
    Becerra filed an appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals last
    week." \[Congressional Quarterly,

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For A February 2018 Two-Year Budget Deal
Which, Among Other Things, Increased Spending By \$300 Billion,
Suspended The Debt Ceiling, Reauthorized Community Health Centers For
Two Years And Repealed The Independent Payment Advisory Board.** In
February 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for a two-year budget deal that
re-opened the government after a brief shutdown. According to the New
York Times, "With Mr. Trump's signature, the government will reopen
before many Americans were aware it had closed, with a deal that
includes about \$300 billion in additional funds over two years for
military and nonmilitary programs, almost \$90 billion in disaster
relief in response to last year's hurricanes and wildfires, and a higher
statutory debt ceiling." In addition, according to Congressional
Quarterly, the legislation "would provide funding for federal government
operations and services at current levels through March 23, 2018 \[...\]
\[and\] retroactively extends numerous tax breaks that expired at the
end of 2016. It also extends the CHIP program for another four years
(through FY 2027) and funds community health centers for another two
years." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to
the House amendment to the bill. The House agreed to the motion,
essentially on passage, by a vote of 240 to 186. The bill was then sent
to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 69,

    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The agreement repeals the
    provisions of the 2010 health care law that created IPAB and it
    restores previous law to maintain the current Medicare spending
    review process, under which MedPAC makes non-binding
    recommendations. CBO estimates that repealing IPAB would increase

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Final Version Of Trump's Tax Reform
Plan, Which Substantially Cut Taxes For Rich Americans And Corporations,
And Repealed The Individual Mandate.** In December 2017, Fitzpatrick
voted for the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, also known as Trump's tax reform
bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "This Conference Summary
deals with the conference report on HR 1, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which
the House will consider Tuesday. The agreement significantly cuts
corporate and individual taxes and seeks to simply the tax code,
although most individual tax provisions would expire after 2025. It
reduces the corporate tax from 35% to 21% and reduces taxation of
so-called 'pass-through' businesses where profits are taxed at the
individual rate. For corporate taxes it also establishes a 'territorial'
tax system that exempts most overseas income from U.S. taxation. Most
individual tax rate rates would be reduced, including by dropping the
top rate from 39.6% to 37%, and it eliminates personal exemptions but
nearly doubles the standard deduction so fewer taxpayers will itemize
deductions." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 227 to 203. The Senate later passed a slightly modified version
of the bill, which the House later agreed to. President Trump later
signed an amended version of the bill into law. \[House Vote 692,

    Congressional Budget Office, "Average premiums in the nongroup
    market would increase by about 10 percent in most years of the
    decade (with no changes in the ages of people purchasing insurance
    accounted for) relative to CBO's baseline projections. In other

-   **In 2027, 83 Percent Of The Total Tax Benefit Would Go To The Top
    One Percent.** According to Tax Policy Center, "n 2027, the overall
    average tax cut would be \$160, or 0.2 percent of after-tax income
    (table 3), largely because almost all individual income tax
    provisions would sunset after 2025. On average, taxes would be

    Office said Wednesday. Some of the nation's sickest would pay much
    more for health care. Under the House bill, the number of uninsured
    would be slightly lower, but deficits would be somewhat higher, than
    the budget office estimated before Republican leaders made a series

-   **Legislation Replaced The Individual Mandate With A Potential 12
    Month 30 Percent Premium Surcharge For Those Who Are Without
    Coverage For Longer Than 63 Days.** According to Vox, "Unlike
    Obamacare, the AHCA does not mandate that all Americans be covered
    by health insurance or pay a fee. It repeals the individual mandate,
    which was one of Obamacare's least popular provisions. Instead, it
    has a different way of penalizing people who decide to remain
    uninsured: requiring those who don't maintain 'continuous coverage'
    to pay a hefty fine when they want to reenter the insurance market.
    This continuous coverage policy has shown up a lot in Republican
    replacement plans. It was part of Speaker Ryan's A Better Way
    proposal and Rep. Tom Price's Empowering Patients First Act. Here's
    how it works: If a worker goes straight from insurance at work to
    her own policy, her insurer has to charge her a standard rate --- it
    can't take the cost of her condition into account. But if said
    worker had a lapse in coverage longer than 63 days --- perhaps she
    couldn't afford a new plan between jobs --- and went to the
    individual market later, insurers could charge her a 30 percent
    premium surcharge. She would need to pay that higher premium for a
    full year before returning to the standard rate." \[Vox,

    requirement that prevents insurers from charging older people
    premiums that are more than three times larger than the premiums
    charged younger people in the nongroup and small-group markets.
    Unless a state sets a different limit, H.R. 1628 would allow
    insurers to charge older people five times more than younger ones
    beginning in 2018." \[CBO,

-   **Legislation Would Allow States To Seek A Waiver On Insurance
    Requirements.** According to the Washington Post, "Congressional
    analysts concluded that one change to the House bill aimed at
    lowering premiums, by allowing states to opt out of some current
    insurance requirements, would encourage some employers to maintain
    coverage for their workers and get younger, healthier people to buy
    plans on their own. But those gains would be largely offset by
    consumers with preexisting conditions, who would face higher
    premiums than they do now." \[Washington Post,

    that waive key consumer protections in the current law, including
    the ban on insurers charging sick consumers more. The budget office
    estimates that about one-sixth of the U.S. population live in states
    that would seek such waivers, which would be allowed under the House
    bill. 'Over time, it would become more difficult for less healthy
    people (including people with preexisting medical conditions) in

    Insurance With Fewer Benefits, Likely Driving Up Consumer Costs For

    Health And Substance Abuse.** According to the Los Angeles Times,
    "The budget office projected that average premiums for those who buy
    their own coverage would be lower in some states after 2020 than
    under Obamacare, an estimate quickly hailed by Republicans. \[...\]
    But the decrease would be driven largely driven by the fact that
    more people would have plans that cover fewer benefits and shift
    more costs to consumers, budget analysts wrote. Healthier consumers
    'would be able to purchase nongroup insurance with relatively low
    premiums,' the budget office said. But skimpier plans with high
    deductibles would be particularly problematic for Americans facing
    high medical needs. 'Some people enrolled in nongroup insurance
    would experience substantial increases in what they would spend on
    healthcare,' the report notes. Out-of-pocket costs for pregnancy,
    mental health and substance abuse would likely 'increase by
    thousands of dollars' for people in some states, the budget office
    said." \[Los Angeles Times,

-   **CBO: States That Opt Out Of Community Rating Protections Would
    Lead To Sick Americans Being Priced Out Of The Insurance Market.**
    According to the CBO, "Community-rated premiums would rise over
    time, and people who are less healthy (including those with
    preexisting or newly acquired medical conditions) would ultimately
    be unable to purchase comprehensive nongroup health insurance at
    premiums comparable to those under current law, if they could
    purchase it at all---despite the additional funding that would be
    available under H.R. 1628 to help reduce premiums. As a result, the
    nongroup markets in those states would become unstable for people
    with higher-than-average expected health care costs. That
    instability would cause some people who would have been insured in
    the nongroup market under current law to be uninsured." \[CBO via

    would also see higher premiums or lose coverage altogether. For
    example, under the House bill, a 64-year-old single American with an
    income of \$26,500 a year would see his or her annual insurance bill
    jump from \$1,700 to \$13,600 in states that waive protections now
    mandated by Obamacare, according to the budget office. By contrast,
    a similar consumer who is 21 would see his or her premiums decrease
