    Epidemic And Pandemic Preparedness, Including Public Wealth
    Workforce Retention And Pathogens Of Pandemic Research.** According

    for pathogens of pandemic concerns." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **The FY 2023 Omnibus Package Would Phase Out A Requirement That
    Prevented States From Dis-Enrolling Medicaid Recipients During The
    COVID-19 Public Health Emergency.** According to CNN, "The
    legislation would phase out the requirement that prevents states
    from disenrolling Medicaid recipients as long as the national public
    health emergency is in effect in exchange for an enhanced federal
    match. This continuous coverage measure was enacted as part of a
    Covid-19 relief package passed in March 2020 and has led to a record
    90 million enrollees in Medicaid, many of whom may no longer meet
    the income requirements to qualify." \[CNN,

    redeterminations as of April 1. The legislation also calls for
    phasing down the enhanced federal match between April and the end of
    2023, a longer time frame than the relief measure currently in
    effect would provide. That would relieve states of some of the
    pressure to winnow their Medicaid rolls quickly. Estimates vary on
    how many people would lose their Medicaid benefits, though they
    range as high as 19 million. Many folks, however, could qualify for
    other coverage." \[CNN,

    Children.** According to CNN, "Also, under a provision in the law,
    Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP,

    uninterrupted access to health care throughout the year." \[CNN,

    Postpartum Coverage For 12 Months For Medicaid Recipients, A Policy
    That Was Made Available Through The American Rescue Plan.**

    for states to offer 12 months of postpartum coverage for low-income
    mothers through Medicaid, rather than just 60 days. More than two
    dozen states, plus the District of Columbia, have implemented the
    measure, which was available on a temporary basis through the
    American Rescue Plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
    Another seven states are planning to implement the option." \[CNN,

    Of Health, The CDC, And The Assistant Secretary For Preparedness And
    Response, Which Would Boost Development Of New Therapies And

    National Biosecurity.** According to CNN, "Plus, the package
    provides more money for the National Institutes of Health, the
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Assistant
    Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The funds are intended to
    speed the development of new therapies, diagnostics and preventive

    low-income families to afford child care." \[CNN,
    [12/29/22](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/politics/spending-bill-congress-omnibus/index.html)\]

    pride in touting their victory in the months-long battle to keep new
    partisan riders out of the omnibus while retaining legacy riders
    that benefit their party, like the Hyde amendment that bars federal
    funding for abortion in most cases. 'At no time should U.S. taxpayer
    dollars be used to kill the unborn,' Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky.,
    said, referring to the GOP's successful effort in getting the Hyde
    amendment and other anti-abortion policies restored to the bill."
