### Early Hearing Detection And Intervention

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Reauthorize Grants To Support State Infant
And Young Child Hearing Screening And Intervention Programs Through FY
2027.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted for the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act
of 2022, which would "reauthorize through fiscal 2027 grants to support
state infant and young child hearing screening and intervention programs
and relevant technical assistance, authorizing \$17.8 million annually
to the Health Resources and Services Administration for the program, as
well as \$10.7 million annually to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention for related technical assistance, research and data
collection. It would also require the Government Accountability Office
to report to Congress, within two years of enactment, on state early
hearing detection and intervention programs, including, among other
provisions, how information collected through the programs informs
knowledge about hearing loss and existing efforts to address disparities
and improve access to and awareness of EHDI programs." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 408-17, thus the bill
was sent to President Biden and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote
