### Rural Hospitals

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For Establishing Grants To Encourage Hospitals
In Rural And Medically Underserved Areas.** In December 2019,
Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment to a bill lowering drug prices for
Medicare that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "require the
Health and Human Services Department to establish grant programs to
award grants of no more than \$250,000 to encourage hospitals in rural
and medically underserved areas including critical access hospitals, to
establish medical residency training programs or to establish
partnerships with other hospitals to host residents under such a
program." The vote was on adoption of an amendment. The House adopted
the amendment by a vote of 351-73. \[House Vote 677,
