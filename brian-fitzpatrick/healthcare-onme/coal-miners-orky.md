### Health Care Benefits For Coal Miners

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The May 2017 FY 2017 Omnibus
Appropriations Bill That Included A Permanent Fix For Health Benefits To
Retired Coal Miners.** In May 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for the FY 2017
omnibus appropriations bill that would keep much of the government open
and would have provided \$1.16 trillion in discretionary spending.
According to PBS, "On Monday, lawmakers announced that they had reached
a permanent solution for miners by glomming a health care fix onto the
new government funding bill on track for passage this week. Funding for
the miners provision would rely on trade fees, called customs user fees,
that apply to a variety of transactions like merchandise processing,
harbor maintenance and passenger transportation. All told, it would net
about \$1.38 billion over the next ten years, according to a recent
Congressional Budget Office estimate --- more than enough to fund those
health benefits for the next decade." Overall, the legislation would
have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] \$1.16
trillion in discretionary appropriations through Sept. 30, 2017 for
federal departments and agencies covered by the remaining 11 fiscal 2017
spending bills. \[...\] The measure would also \[have\] provide\[d\]
\$608 million for health benefits for retired coal miners, \$296 million
for Medicaid payments to Puerto Rico, and \$341 million to replace 40
miles of existing fencing along the southwestern border, though the
designs of the fencing must have been 'previously deployed'." The vote
was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendments. The House agreed to
the motion by a vote of 309 to 118. The Senate later also agreed to the
legislation, sending the bill to the president, who signed it into law.

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Extend Health Care Benefits For Retired
Coal Miners.** In April 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for a one-week
continuing resolution. According to Congressional Quarterly, the
legislation would have "extend\[ed\] continuing appropriations for
federal government operations through May 5, 2017. It would also
\[have\] provide\[d\] for an extension, through May 5, of health care
benefits for retired coal miners." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the joint resolution by a vote of 382 to 30. The Senate later
agreed to the legislation by voice vote and the president signed it into
law. \[House Vote 236,
