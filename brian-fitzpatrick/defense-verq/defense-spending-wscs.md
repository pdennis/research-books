### Energy Resiliency In European Command Zone

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Direct The Defense Department To Enhance
Energy Resiliency Of Operating Bases In The European Command Zone And
End The Use Of Russian Energy Within Five Years.** In December 2022,
according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the James M.
Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, which
would, in part, "require the DOD to make plans to increase the energy
resiliency of operating bases in the European Command zone and eliminate
the use of Russian energy within five years." The vote was on passage.
The House passed the bill by a vote of 350-80, thus the bill was sent to
the Senate for final concurrence. The Senate concurred with the House,
sent the final bill to President Biden, and it ultimately became law.

### FY 2017

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For The May 2017 FY 2017 Omnibus
Appropriations Bill That Increased Defense Spending By \$15 Billion;
Trump Had Requested \$30 Billion.** In May 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for
the FY 2017 omnibus appropriations bill that would keep much of the
government open and would have provided \$1.16 trillion in discretionary
spending. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The \$1.163 trillion
package provide\[d\] \$593 billion for defense, including \$15 billion
of the \$30 billion in supplemental defense funds requested by President
Trump in March." Overall, the legislation would have, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] \$1.16 trillion in discretionary
appropriations through Sept. 30, 2017 for federal departments and
agencies covered by the remaining 11 fiscal 2017 spending bills. \[...\]
The measure would also \[have\] provide\[d\] \$608 million for health
benefits for retired coal miners, \$296 million for Medicaid payments to
Puerto Rico, and \$341 million to replace 40 miles of existing fencing
along the southwestern border, though the designs of the fencing must
have been 'previously deployed'." The vote was on a motion to concur in
the Senate amendments. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 309
to 118. The Senate later also agreed to the legislation, sending the
bill to the president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 249,

-   **Legislation Did Not Include A Dollar For Dollar Increase In
    Defense And Non-Defense Spending.** According to The Hill, "Speaker
    Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is touting this week's budget deal for breaking
    the rule that Democrats enforced under President Obama: Every dollar
    in increased defense spending had to be matched by a dollar increase
    for nondefense discretionary programs. 'Under the Obama rules, if
    you wanted to help the military, if you wanted a pay raise for the
    soldiers, if you wanted to buy new airplanes and new ships and more
    munitions, a dollar for that, you had to have a dollar domestic
    spending. We just broke that parity,' Ryan said at a press
    conference Tuesday morning. 'That's the biggest victory we could
    have had --- \$25 billion year over year for our military, to begin
    to rebuild our military, without that kind of corresponding increase
    in domestic discretionary spending. That, to me, is very important,'
    he added." \[The Hill,

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For An FY 2017 Defense Appropriations Bill.**
In March 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for appropriating \$557.9 billion in
defense discretionary spending. According to Congressional Quarterly,
the legislation would have "provide\[d\] \$577.9 billion in
discretionary funding for the Defense Department in fiscal 2017. The
total would \[have\] include\[d\] \$516.1 billion in base Defense
Department funding subject to spending caps. It also would \[have\]
include\[d\] \$61.8 billion in overseas contingency operations funding.
The bill would \[have\] provide\[d\] approximately \$210.1 billion for
operations and maintenance, approximately \$117.8 billion for
procurement, approximately \$72.7 billion for research and development
and \$132.2 billion for military personnel, including a 2.1 percent pay
raise. It also would \[have\] provide\[d\] roughly \$34.1 billion for
defense health programs. The measure would \[have\] prohibit\[ed\] use
of funds to construct or modify potential facilities in the United
States to house Guantanamo Bay detainees." The House passed the bill by
a vote of 371 to 48. The bill was later turned into a continuing
resolution. \[House Vote 136,

### FY 2018

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For The \$1.3 Trillion FY 2018 Omnibus
Spending Deal Which Raised Spending By \$138 Billion Over FY 2017
Levels, Including \$80 Billion In Defense Spending.** In March 2018,
Fitzpatrick voted for the FY 2018 Omnibus spending bill. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "Combined, the spending measures would provide
about \$1.3 trillion in discretionary spending, with \$1.2 trillion
subject to discretionary spending caps, and \$78.1 billion designated as
Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The measure\'s spending levels
are consistent with the increased defense and non-defense budget caps
set by the two-year budget deal agreed to last month. That agreement
increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80 billion and the non-defense
cap by \$63 billion. Given that the previous caps were set to reduce
overall discretionary spending by \$5 billion, the net increase provided
by the omnibus is \$138 billion over the FY 2017 level." The vote was on
the motion to concur in the Senate Amendment with an Amendment. The
House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 256
to 167. The Senate later agreed to the legislation, sending it to the
president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 127,

-   **Omnibus Increased Defense Spending By \$80 Billion And In Domestic
    Spending By \$63 Billion.** According to the Washington Post, "Under
    that agreement, defense spending generally favored by Republicans is
    set to jump \$80 billion over previously authorized spending levels,
    while domestic spending favored by Democrats rises by \$63 billion.
    The defense funding includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military
    personnel and \$144 billion for Pentagon hardware. The domestic
    spending is scattered across the rest of the federal government, but
    lawmakers are highlighting increases in funding for infrastructure,
    medical research, veterans programs and efforts to combat the opioid
    epidemic. Civilian federal employees get a 1.9 percent pay raise,
    breaking parity with the military for the first time in several
    years." \[Washington Post,

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For A February 2018 Two-Year Budget Deal
Which, Among Other Things, Increased Spending By \$300 Billion,
Suspended The Debt Ceiling And Provided \$90 Billion In Disaster Relief
For The 2017 Hurricanes And Wildfires.** In February 2018, Fitzpatrick
voted for a two-year budget deal that re-opened the government after a
brief shutdown. According to the New York Times, "With Mr. Trump's
signature, the government will reopen before many Americans were aware
it had closed, with a deal that includes about \$300 billion in
additional funds over two years for military and nonmilitary programs,
almost \$90 billion in disaster relief in response to last year's
hurricanes and wildfires, and a higher statutory debt ceiling." In
addition, according to Congressional Quarterly, the legislation "would
provide funding for federal government operations and services at
current levels through March 23, 2018 \[...\] \[and\] retroactively
extends numerous tax breaks that expired at the end of 2016. It also
extends the CHIP program for another four years (through FY 2027) and
funds community health centers for another two years." The vote was on a
motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the
bill. The House agreed to the motion, essentially on passage, by a vote
of 240 to 186. The bill was then sent to the president, who signed it
into law. \[House Vote 69,

-   **Legislation Increased Budget Caps For Defense Spending By \$165
    Billion.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The agreement
    increases the caps on defense and non-defense discretionary spending
    for FY 2018 and FY 2019, raising defense caps by \$165 billion over
    those two years and non-defense caps by \$131 billion, while
    extending current stopgap funding through March 23 to give Congress
    time to enact a final FY 2018 omnibus spending bill."

members of the armed forces; include in its annual budget materials a

require the Defense Department to notify Congress on steps taken to
mitigate 5G and 6G security risks posed by at-risk vendors, including
