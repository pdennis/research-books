# Space Corps

**2019: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted For The FY 2020 National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA), Which Established The United States Space
Corps.** In December 2019, Fitzpatrick effectively voted for the FY 2020
NDAA. According to Congressional Quarterly, "The agreement establishes a
United States Space Corps within the Air Force Department, not as an
independent department." The vote was on adoption of the conference
report to accompany the bill. The House adopted the conference report by
a vote of 377-48. The bill was later passed by the Senate and signed
into law by the President. \[House Vote 672,

-   **The FY 2020 NDAA Established The Space Corps As An Independent
    Department Within The Air Force Department.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "President Trump has pushed for creation of
    a separate Space Force as a free standing command, i.e. an
    independent department like the Army, Navy or Air Force. The
    agreement establishes a United States Space Corps within the Air
    Force Department, not as an independent department. Like the Marine
    Corps under the U.S. Navy, the Space Corps would be led by a
    four-star Commandant who would be a member of the Joint Chiefs of
    Staff. There would be no civilian head like those for the Army, Navy
    and Air Force." \[Congressional Quarterly,
