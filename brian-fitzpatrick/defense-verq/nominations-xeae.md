### James Mattis

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Waive A Law Preventing President-Elect
Donald Trump's Nominee, James Mattis, From Becoming The Secretary Of
Defense.** In January 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for legislation that would
have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "allow\[ed\] the first
person to be confirmed secretary of Defense after the bill\'s enactment
to serve in the position, even if the individual has not been retired
from the military for seven years, so long as the person has been
retired for at least three years. The bill would thus \[have\]
provide\[d\] an exemption for President-elect Donald Trump's pick for
the position, retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis, from a requirement
for a seven-year waiting period before former servicemembers can be
appointed to Defense secretary." The vote was on the legislation. The
House adopted the bill by a vote of 268 to 151. Since the bill had
already passed the Senate, it was then sent to the president. President
Trump signed the legislation into law. \[House Vote 59,
