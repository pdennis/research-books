# Memorials And Monuments

### Confederate Memorial

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Restoring The Confederate Memorial To
The Arlington National Cemetery.** In June 2024, Fitzpatrick voted
against , according to Congressional Quarterly, "amendment no. 44 that
would direct the secretary of the Army to relocate the Reconciliation
Memorial, also known as the Reconciliation Monument, to its original
location in Arlington National Cemetery." The vote was on the amendment.
The underlying legislation was FY 2025 National Defense Authorization
Act. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of 192 to 230. \[House

-   **The "Reconciliation Memorial" Was The Confederate Memorial Removed
    From The Arlington National Cemetery In December 2023, With Only 24
    Republicans Voting Against Restoring The Monument.** According to
    the Montana Free Press, "Among the amendments to that act was No.
    44, which rekindled a festering debate over a bronze Confederate
    memorial portraying a life-sized Black 'Mammy' holding up a white
    child for a goodbye kiss from its war-bound father. A Black slave
    trailing his uniformed owner is also depicted as part of the
    'Reconciliation Memorial.' The amendment 'directs the Secretary of
    the Army to relocate the Reconciliation Memorial, also known as the
    Reconciliation Monument, to its original location in Arlington
    National Cemetery.' The monument was removed from the federal
    cemetery in December 2023 after a flurry of legal challenges. Both
    Montana Reps. Matt Rosendale and Ryan Zinke voted for the measure
    proposed by Rep. Andrew Clyde, a Georgia Republican. Amendment 44
    failed \[192\] to 230. It was opposed by just 24 House Republicans."
