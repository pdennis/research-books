In July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted

Fiscal Year 2023, which would "prohibit the use of evidence obtained by
or with the assistance of a member of the armed forces in violation of
the Posse Comitatus Act in a court or other legal proceeding." The vote
was on the adoption of an amendment. The House adopted the amendment by
a vote 215-213. \[House Vote 342,

-   **The Posse Comitatus Act Prohibits Military Members From
    Participating In Civilian Law Enforcement Without Proper
    Authorization.** According to Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law,
    "The Posse Comitatus Act consists of just one sentence: 'Whoever,
    except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the
    Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army
    or the Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the
    laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two
    years, or both.' In practice, this means that members of the
    military who are subject to the law may not participate in civilian
    law enforcement unless doing so is expressly authorized by a statute
    or the Constitution." \[Brennan Center For Justice At NYU Law,
