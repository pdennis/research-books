    included a measure in their compromise draft of the \[FY 2024\]
    defense policy bill to stop federal dollars from going toward the
    Countering Extremist Activity Working Group. That body was
    established by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in 2021 to address an
    increase in concerning behavior among troops. Members had proposed a
    host of reforms the Pentagon could make to better track, prevent and
    respond to cases of extremism, which the department is still working
    to implement nearly two years later." \[Military Times,

    Project Against Hate and Extremism." \[Military Times,

-   **183 Allegations Of Extremism Were Investigated In 2023, With 78
    Cases Involving Calls To Overthrow The U.S. Government.** According
    to the Military Times, "The Pentagon's Office of Inspector General
    published a report Nov. 30 that found the service branches
    investigated 183 allegations of extremist activity among troops in
    the past year, including 78 cases of service members advocating for
    the overthrow of the U.S. government. While leaders were able to
    report the number of allegations investigated, they did not track
    how many allegations of extremist activity were received but not
    investigated." \[Military Times,
