# Public Health Emergency

### Terminating COVID-19 Public Health Emergency

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted To End The COVID-19 Public Health Emergency
Declared By The Department Of Health And Human Services On January 31,
2020.** In January 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted for the Pandemic is Over Act, which would "terminate
the COVID-19 public health emergency declared by the Health and Human
Services Department on Jan. 31, 2020." The vote was on passage. The
House passed the bill by a vote of 220 to 210, thus the bill was sent to
the Senate. The Senate did not take substantive action on the bill.

-   **The Biden Administration Warned Republicans That Ending The
    COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Would Also Terminate
    Pandemic-Related Border Restrictions, Such As Title 42.** According
    to Congressional Quarterly, "House Republicans overwhelmingly voted
    to pass a bill Tuesday evening to end the COVID-19 public health
    emergency declaration, despite warnings from the Biden
    administration that the measure would also terminate
    pandemic-related border restrictions that congressional Republicans
    support. The bill (HR 382) would wipe out a declaration that
    Republicans say has led to overreach from the White House and
    stunted economic recovery from the pandemic. But
    tough-on-immigration Republicans want to keep the border
    restrictions known as Title 42 that were put in place in a stated
    effort to stem COVID-19 spread." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **The Bill Would Have Ended The Public Health Emergency Immediately,
    Ahead Of The April 11th Expiration.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The second bill (HR 382) from Energy and Commerce Health
    Subcommittee Chair Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., would end the public health
    emergency immediately, ahead of its scheduled expiration on
    April 11. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra has
    pledged to give a 60-day notice before letting the emergency expire,
    which should come on or before Feb. 10." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **The COVID-19 Public Health Emergency By The Department Of Health
    And Human Services Expired On May 11, 2023.** According to a press
    release from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
    "Based on current COVID-19 trends, the Department of Health and
    Human Services (HHS) is planning for the federal Public Health
    Emergency (PHE) for COVID-19, declared under Section 319 of the
