# COVID-19 Vaccines

### Vaccine Tax

**2022: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against Adding COVID-19 Vaccines
To The List Of Vaccines Subject To A 75 Cent Tax Per Dose; Such Proceeds
Would Be Used For Vaccine-Related Injury Or Death Compensation.** In
June 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick effectively
voted against a bill that would "add COVID-19 vaccines to a list of
vaccines subject to a tax of 75 cents per dose, from which proceeds fund
compensation for vaccine-related injury or death through the National
Vaccine Injury Compensation Program." The vote was on the adoption of
the rule. The House adopted the rule by a vote of 217-203, thus the bill
was automatically adopted. \[House Vote 298,
