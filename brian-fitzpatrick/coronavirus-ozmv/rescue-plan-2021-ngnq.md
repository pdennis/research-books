governments; \$47.8 billion for testing and contact tracing; \$168

-   **Democrats Pursued Budget Reconciliation To Avoid A Potential
    Republican Senate Filibuster Which Would Allow Passing The Package
    On A Simple Majority.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Although Congress passed aid measures last year with bipartisan
    support, Democrats opted to use the budget reconciliation process
    this time to avoid the risk of a Republican Senate filibuster. That
    decision, which allows the package to pass on a simple majority
    vote, angered Republicans who noted last year Congress passed nearly
    \$4 trillion worth of bipartisan pandemic aid laws (PL 116-123; PL
    116-127; PL 116-136; PL 116-139; PL 116-260)." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [2/26/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6140112?33)\]

-   **Most Of The Funds Would Be For The \$1,400 Direct Payments,
    Unemployment Checks, Financial Aid To State And Local Governments
    And Public Schools, While Also Helping Businesses, Vaccine
    Distribution, COVID Testing, And Expanding Healthcare Coverage.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Most of the money in the
    package would be used for tax rebate checks of up to \$1,400,
    expanded unemployment benefits, aid to state and local governments,
    and assistance to help public schools reopen after months of online
    learning. Funds are also included to help restaurants, airlines,
    faltering union pension plans and more, as well as for vaccine
    distribution, virus testing and expanding health insurance
    coverage." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **The American Rescue Plan Of 2021 Did Not Include The Hyde
    Amendment And Instead Provided The Greatest Expansion Of
    Taxpayer-Funded Abortion Since Obamacare.** According to a Roll Call
    op-ed by Marjorie Dannenfelser, "Earlier this year, President Joe
    Biden followed through on a major campaign promise to the abortion
    lobby --- and broke with decadeslong bipartisan consensus --- by
    signing a massive stimulus bill without pro-life Hyde Amendment
    protections. In the guise of COVID-19 relief, the so-called American
    Rescue Plan was the largest expansion of taxpayer-funded abortion
    since Obamacare. Now with the administration's budget proposal
    expected this week, a slew of life-saving policies modeled after
    Hyde could also be on the chopping block." \[Marjorie Dannenfelser

-   **The American Rescue Plan Of 2021 Included Additional Funding For
    The Title X Family Planning Program.** According to a press release
    from NARAL, "Today, President Biden signed into law the American
    Rescue Plan Act, the sweeping \$1.9 trillion coronavirus relief
    package to address the healthcare and economic crises caused by the
    COVID-19 pandemic. The legislation will help expand access to
    healthcare and provide additional funding for the Title X family
    planning program. The U.S. House of Representatives approved the
    bill earlier today following the Senate's passage over the weekend."

-   **2021: Senate Republicans Failed To Add The Hyde Amendment Into The
    American Rescue Plan Act.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Lankford, R-Okla., motion to waive all applicable sections of the
    Congressional Budget Act with respect to the Murray, D-Wash., point
    of order that the Lankford amendment no. 1031 to the Schumer,
    D-N.Y., substitute amendment no. 891 to the bill is not germane and
    thus violates section 313(b)(1)(d) of the Congressional Budget Act.
    The amendment would make conforming changes to insert the bill\'s
    provisions related to public health programs and domestic violence
    prevention and support programs into the December 2020 omnibus
    appropriations and coronavirus relief law, which would prohibit the
    use of funds for abortion services." The vote was on a motion to
    waive. The Senate failed to acquire a 3/5 majority and rejected the
    motion by a vote of 52-47. \[Senate Vote 94,
