History Project Act, which would "require the American Folklife Center
at the Library of Congress to establish a 'COVID-19 American History
Project' to collect video and audio recordings, written materials and
photographs related to the personal testimonies of individuals affected
by the COVID-19 pandemic. It would authorize \$250,000 for the project
for fiscal 2022 and such sums as necessary for any fiscal year beginning
in the three-year period following the expiration of the COVID-19 public
health emergency, and it would authorize the library to accept private
donations to fund the project." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 376-47, thus the bill was sent to the
Senate. \[House Vote 89,
