# Declared National Emergency

### Terminating COVID-19 National Emergency

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted To End The COVID-19 National Emergency That
Was Declared On March 13, 2020.** In February 2023, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for a resolution that would
"terminate the COVID-19 national emergency declared by the president on
March 13, 2020." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
resolution by a vote of 229 to 197, thus the bill was sent to the
Senate. The Senate passed the resolution, sent it to President Biden,
and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote 104,

-   **The COVID-19 National Emergency Was Due To Expire In May 2023.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Senate voted Wednesday to
    terminate a COVID-19 pandemic ​national emergency order implemented
    by former President Donald Trump in 2020 that was due to be
    terminated in May anyway. The 68-23 vote on the measure came after
    the House voted 229-197 in February, with 11 Democrats joining 218
    Republicans in support." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **President Biden Signed The Resolution Into Law Despite Opposing
    The Resolution And Pledged To Continue To Work With Agencies To
    Phase Out The National Emergency.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "President Joe Biden will sign the resolution, even as
    the White House continued to say he is opposed. 'The President
    strongly opposes H J Res 7, and the administration is planning to
    wind down the COVID national emergency and public health emergency
    on May 11,' a White House official said Wednesday. 'If this bill
    comes to his desk, however, he will sign it, and the administration
    will continue working with agencies to wind down the national
    emergency with as much notice as possible to Americans who could
    potentially be impacted.'" \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Ending The COVID-19 National Emergency Could Impact Waivers Meant
    For Health Care Providers To Serve Patients During The Pandemic,
    Like Off-Campus Screening, Medicare Advantage Plan Coverage For
    Out-Of-Network Services, And Waiving Physical Or Occupational
    Therapy At Hospices.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Examples of the impact of ending the national emergency include the
    termination of some waivers meant to help health care providers
    serve patients during the pandemic. One such waiver from the Centers
    for Medicare and Medicaid Services allowing hospitals to screen
    patients for COVID-19 off-campus would expire, while another
    requiring private Medicare Advantage plans to cover services at
    out-of-network facilities would also expire. Another waiver allowed
    hospices to not provide physical or occupational therapy during the
    national emergency." \[Congressional Quarterly,

**2023: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted To End The COVID-19 National
Emergency Declared On March 13, 2020.** In January 2023, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the "adoption of the rule
(H Res 75) that would provide for floor consideration of the resolution
relating to a national emergency declared by the president on March 13,
2020 (H J Res 7)." The vote was on the adoption of the rule. The House
adopted the rule by a vote of 216 to 208. \[House Vote 96,
