# Paycheck Protection Program

### Funding

**2020: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) And
Health Care Enhancement Act, Congress's Fourth Coronavirus Response
Bill, That Provided An Additional \$310 Billion To The PPP.** In April
2020, Fitzpatrick voted for the Paycheck Protection Program and Health
Care Enhancement Act as part of Congress's response to the Coronavirus
pandemic that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide an
additional \$310 billion for Paycheck Protection Program loans under the
Small Business Administration, including \$60 billion for lending by
smaller financial institutions and those serving underbanked
communities. The program provides forgivable loans of up to \$10 million
for businesses with 500 or fewer employees, including for payroll costs,
mortgage payments, and rent or utility payments." The vote was on a
motion to concur. The House passed the bill by a vote of 388-5 and the
bill was then signed into law by the President. \[House Vote 104,

-   **The Bill Provided An Additional \$310 Billion To The Paycheck
    Protection Program, Which Provides Loans To Small Businesses To Keep
    Employees On Payroll.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    agreement increases by \$310 billion the level of forgivable loans
    to small businesses under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP),
    increasing the program\'s total loan authorization level from \$349
    billion to \$659 billion \[...\] Under the program, which was
    established in March by the CARES Act, the SBA guarantees 100% of
    all PPP loans issued by private banks, with a maximum loan limit of
    \$10 million per borrower. Small businesses \[...\] that use loan
    proceeds to cover payroll, rent, mortgage payments, and utilities
    through June 30 would be eligible for loan forgiveness. The SBA
    would then use appropriated funds to reimburse banks for forgiven
    loans. Forgiveness is based on the employer maintaining or quickly
    rehiring laid-off employees and maintaining salary levels at
    comparable 2019 levels, and the SBA requires a borrower to use at
    least 75% of the loan amount for payroll to be eligible for
    forgiveness." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Because The PPP Was Criticized For Favoring Larger Small
    Businesses That Have Relationships With Larger Banks, This Bill Set
    Aside \$60 Billion For Smaller Financial Institutions.** According
    to Congressional Quarterly, "One criticism of the initial roll-out
    of the Paycheck Protection Program was that its 'first-come,
    first-served' nature favored larger small businesses, including
    subsidiaries and affiliates of large national companies, as they
    typically have established relations with larger banks that already
    participate in SBA lending programs and were able to process PPP
    applications more quickly. While small lenders, including credit
    unions, were authorized by the CARES Act to issue forgivable PPP
    loans, many found that much of the program\'s initial funding had
    been committed before they were able to begin processing
    applications. To ensure that a larger pool of small businesses can
    access loans under the Paycheck Protection Program, particularly
    small businesses in financially underserved areas, the measure
    establishes a set-aside for smaller lenders. Specifically \[...\]
    \$60 billion would be reserved for small and moderate sized
    financial institutions --- with \$30 billion set aside for banks and
    credit unions that have between \$50 billion and \$10 billion in
    total assets, and another \$30 billion set aside for banks, credit
    unions, and community financial institutions with assets below \$10
    billion." \[Congressional Quarterly,
