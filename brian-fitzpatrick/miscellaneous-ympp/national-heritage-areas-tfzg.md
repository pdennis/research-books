# National Heritage Areas

### Financial Assistance And Management Oversight

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Standardize The Federal Designation Of
National Heritage Areas And Provide Financial Aid And Management
Oversight To Heritage Areas.** In December 2022, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the National Heritage
Area Act, which would "standardize the federal designation of National
Heritage Areas, which are congressionally designated historic,
culturally important areas that receive federal support and are
administered by local organizations, governments and nonprofits. The
bill would create within the Interior Department a National Heritage
Area System comprising all national heritage areas. Among other
provisions, it would direct the department to provide financial
assistance and management oversight to heritage areas and authorize the
department to conduct feasibility and suitability studies for the
addition of proposed heritage areas to the system. The bill would also
extend the authorization of 45 heritage areas through 2037 and authorize
between \$1-2 million in annual funding for heritage areas. It would
require feasibility studies for two new heritage areas, designate seven
new heritage areas and redesignate two existing heritage areas." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 326-95, thus
the bill was sent to President Biden and it ultimately became law.
