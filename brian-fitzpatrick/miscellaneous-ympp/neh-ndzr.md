# National Endowment For The Humanities

### Elimination

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating The National
Endowment For The Humanities.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted
against a budget resolution that would in part, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget
authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by
reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total
discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would
assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal
2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or
terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010
health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's
Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would
require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S.
Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the
budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget
resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281.

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating The National Endowment For The
    Humanities.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018
    Budget, "Eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts and the
    National Endowment for the Humanities The federal government should
    not be in the business of funding the arts. The Constitution is
    clear about the federal government's proper role 'to promote the
    progress of Science and useful Arts' as the protection of private
    property rights: 'securing for limited Times to Authors and
    Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and
    Discoveries'. Support for the arts can easily and more properly be
    found from non-governmental sources. Eliminating the National
    Endowment for the Arts would save taxpayers \$148 million per year
    and eliminating the National Endowment for the Humanities would save
    an additional \$148 million per year. The president's Budget
    Blueprint would eliminate these inappropriate agencies."
