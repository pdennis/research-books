# Corporation For Public Broadcasting

### Elimination

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating Funding For The
Corporation For Public Broadcasting.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick
voted against a budget resolution that would in part, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget
authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by
reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total
discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would
assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal
2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or
terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010
health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's
Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would
require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S.
Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the
budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget
resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281.

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating Funding For The Corporation For
    Public Broadcasting.** According to the Republican Study Committee
    FY 2018 Budget, "Eliminate Funding for the Corporation for Public
    Broadcasting (CPB) A free society should not have
    government-supported media outlets, especially ones that so often
    convey political news and opinion. There is no shortage of media
    outlets and news services available to consumers. Even Sesame Street
    is now on HBO. Eliminating all taxpayer funding for the Corporation
    for Public Broadcasting (CPB) beginning in FY 2018 would save \$485
    million per year." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed
