# National Endowment For The Arts

### Elimination

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating The National
Endowment For The Arts.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a
budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal
2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by
\$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending
at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas
Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and
would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense
account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and
would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into
a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs,
such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was
an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC
budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555,

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating The National Endowment For The
    Arts.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget,
    "Eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts and the National
    Endowment for the Humanities The federal government should not be in
    the business of funding the arts. The Constitution is clear about
    the federal government's proper role 'to promote the progress of
    Science and useful Arts' as the protection of private property
    rights: 'securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the
    exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries'.
    Support for the arts can easily and more properly be found from
    non-governmental sources. Eliminating the National Endowment for the
    Arts would save taxpayers \$148 million per year and eliminating the
    National Endowment for the Humanities would save an additional \$148
    million per year. The president's Budget Blueprint would eliminate
    these inappropriate agencies." \[Republican Study Committee,
