-   **The Interior Department And Zinke Came Under Inspector General
    Investigation Concerning A Rejected Expert Analysis Preventing
    Native American Tribes From Opening A Casino In Connecticut.**
    According to Politico, "Trump administration officials rejected
    recommendations from federal experts on Indian gaming policy when
    they blocked two American Indian tribes from opening a casino in
    Connecticut last year, documents obtained by POLITICO indicate. The
    heavily blacked-out documents add to questions about whether
    Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and his political appointees buckled
    to lobbying pressure from MGM Resorts International, a gambling
    industry giant that is planning its own casino just 12 miles from
    the project proposed by the Mohegan and Mashantucket Pequot tribes.
    Interior's inspector general is investigating the department's
    handling of the tribes' casino application, a spokeswoman told
    POLITICO, after Connecticut lawmakers asked the internal watchdog to
    look into the matter." \[Politico,
