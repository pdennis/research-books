### Americans With Disabilities Act

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Amending The Americans With Americans
With Disabilities Act By Requiring Victims That Sue In Federal Court
Over Violations First Give Written Notice And Give The Business 120 Days
To Rectify The Violation.** In February 2018, Fitzpatrick voted against
legislation that fundamentally alters the ADA. According to the
Washington Post, "Under the bill, those wishing to sue businesses in
federal court over an ADA public-accommodations violation must first
deliver a written notice to that business detailing the illegal barrier
to access and then give that business 60 days to come up with a plan to
address the complaints and an additional 60 days to take action." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 225 to 192.
The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote

-   **Legislation Would "Essentially Gut The ADA's Provisions Dealing
    With Public Accommodations."** According To The Washington Post,
    "But Activists Say The Bill, If Enacted, Would Essentially Gut The
    ADA's Provisions Dealing With Public Accommodations by removing any
    incentive that businesses have to comply with the law before a
    complaint is filed. 'We know of no other law that outlaws
    discrimination but permits entities to discriminate with impunity
    until victims experience that discrimination and educate the
    entities perpetrating it about their obligations not to
    discriminate,' said a September letter from the Consortium for
    Citizens with Disabilities signed by more than 200 disability rights
    groups. 'Such a regime is absurd, and would make people with
    disabilities second-class citizens.'" \[Washington Post,
