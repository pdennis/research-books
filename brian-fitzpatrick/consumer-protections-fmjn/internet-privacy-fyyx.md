### Repealing A Rule Requiring Internet Service Providers Receive Permission Before Selling Personal Data

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Disapprove An FCC Rule That Required
Internet Service Providers To Receive Permission Before Selling Consumer
Data.** In March 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for legislation that would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "overturn the internet privacy
rule. \[...\] The rule is controversial because most internet firms such
as Google and Facebook are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission,
which allows companies to use consumers' personal data to sell targeted
advertising unless the customer objects. The FCC required internet
service providers such as Comcast and AT&T to get permission in advance
to do the same thing. \[...\] A CRA can be used for a limited time in
the new Congress to repeal regulations issued toward the end of the
Obama administration under a resolution of disapproval, which requires
the president\'s signature to take effect." The House agreed to the
resolution by a vote of 215 to 205. The legislation was signed into law
by the president. \[House Vote 202,

-   **CNBC: "Congress Just Cleared The Way For Internet Providers To
    Sell Your Web Browsing History."** According to CNBC, "Congress just
    cleared the way for internet providers to sell your web browsing
    history. Internet providers now just need a signature from President
    Trump before they're free to take, share, and even sell your web
    browsing history without your permission. The House of
    Representatives passed a resolution today overturning an Obama-era
    FCC rule that required internet providers to get customers\'
    permission before sharing their browsing history with other
    companies. The rules also required internet providers to protect
    that data from hackers and inform customers of any breaches."

-   **The FCC Earlier Delayed Implementation Of The Rule.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The GOP-controlled FCC last week blocked
    part of the rule from taking effect while it considered revamping
    the entire measure. But congressional action would speed the process
    along." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Sen. Markey (D-MA): "Consumers Will Have No Ability To Stop
    Internet Service Providers From Invading Their Privacy And Selling
    Sensitive Information."** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "'Consumers will have no ability to stop internet service providers
    from invading their privacy and selling sensitive information about
    their health, finances, and children to advertisers, insurers, data
    brokers or others who can profit off of this personal information,
    all without their affirmative consent,' Markey added. 'I strongly
    oppose this resolution, and will fight to ensure that consumers, not
    broadband companies, have control over their personal, sensitive
    information.'" \[Congressional Quarterly,
