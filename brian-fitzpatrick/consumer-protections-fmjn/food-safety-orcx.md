### Foodborne Illness Regulations

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Exempting Regulations Related To Food
Borne Safety From Legislation That Would Add Requirements For How
Federal Rules Are Made.** In January 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against an
amendment that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"exempt\[ed\] rules related to the prevention of foodborne illness
transmission. It would \[have\] remove the bill's provision that would
effectively overturn two Supreme Court decisions that require federal
courts to defer to an agency's interpretation of the underlying law or
rule when considering challenges to agency rules." The underlying
legislation, also according to Congressional Quarterly, "would modify
the federal rule-making process, including by codifying requirements for
agencies to consider costs and benefits of alternatives. The bill would
create additional steps that agencies would need to follow when planning
'major' rules with annual costs of more than \$100 million or
'high-impact' rules with annual costs of more than \$1 billion." The
vote was on the amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of
190 to 232. \[House Vote 38,
