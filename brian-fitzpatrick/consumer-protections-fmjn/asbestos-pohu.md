### Requiring Regular Reports From Asbestos Trusts

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require Regular Reports From The Asbestos
Trusts.** In March 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for the Fairness in Class
Action Litigation Act. According to Congressional Quarterly, the
legislation would have "prohibit\[ed\] federal courts from certifying
proposed classes of individuals for a class-action lawsuit unless each
member of the class has suffered the same type and degree of injury.
Additionally, the bill would \[have\] require\[d\] asbestos trusts to
issue quarterly reports on claims made against the trusts and payouts
made by the trusts for asbestos-related injuries." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 220 to 201. The Senate
took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 148,

-   **Reports Would Require Public Disclosure Of Names, Medical
    Information And Awards To Victims; Veterans Disproportionately
    Suffer From Asbestos Related Illnesses.** According to the
    Washington Post, "That measure would also affect asbestos trusts,
    which distribute funds from legal settlements to victims of
    asbestos-related illnesses and injuries. The trusts would be
    required to publicly disclose the names, medical information and
    award amounts of victims, an attempt to cut down on fraudulent
    claims that opponents say would violate victims' privacy rights.
    Military veterans disproportionately suffer from asbestos-related
    illnesses and injuries, and many veterans groups are fighting the
    bill. 'Forcing our veterans to publicize their work histories,
    medical conditions, majority of their Social Security numbers, and
    information about their children and families is an offensive
    invasion of privacy to the men and women who have honorably served,'
    18 veterans' groups wrote in a letter to congressional leaders."
