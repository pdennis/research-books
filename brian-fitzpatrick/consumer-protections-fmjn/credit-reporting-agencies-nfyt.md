# Credit Reporting Agencies

### Transparency

**2020: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Requiring Consumer Reporting Agencies
To Make Credit Information More Readily Available For Consumers.** In
June 2020, Fitzpatrick voted against the Protecting Your Credit Score
Act that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "establish a
number of requirements for consumer reporting agencies to provide credit
information and resources to consumers. The bill would require all
consumer reporting agencies to jointly develop an online portal to give
consumers free access to credit reports and other resources \[...\] It
would prohibit agencies from requiring consumers to waive any rights to
access the portal and prohibit the portal from containing advertising or
other solicitations. It would require consumer reporting agencies to
follow 'reasonable procedures' to verify credit report information,
including matching all nine digits of a consumer\'s social security
number. It would require the agencies to provide additional information
to consumers during a credit dispute process, maintain a sufficient
number of personnel to conduct reinvestigations of disputes and notify
consumers of options available to them after a reinvestigation. It would
require such agencies to automatically notify consumers if they receive
notification regarding an adverse action against or a less favorable
offer of credit made to a consumer, and to disclose the credit report
upon which such decisions were based. The bill would formally grant the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau supervisory authority over consumer
reporting agencies." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill
by a vote of 234-179. \[House Vote 126,

-   **Democrats Supported The Increased Transparency, While Republicans
    Raised Concerns Over Security.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, the bill "would ensure that consumer reporting agencies
    are providing fair and accurate information and increase access to
    consumer reports \[...\] Democrats supported the possibility of a
    one-stop portal for credit access and new transparency requirements
    for consumer reporting agencies. Republicans worried the one-stop
    portal would present a data security risk." \[Congressional
