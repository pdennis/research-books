# Class-Action Lawsuit

### Prohibiting Federal Courts From Certifying Class Action Status To A Lawsuit Unless Every Member Of The Class Has Suffered From The Same Injury, Including Its Degree

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted To Permit Federal Class-Action Lawsuits Only
If Every Person In The Class Suffered The Same Type And Scope Of
Injury.** In March 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for the Fairness in Class
Action Litigation Act. According to Congressional Quarterly, the
legislation would have "prohibit\[ed\] federal courts from certifying
proposed classes of individuals for a class-action lawsuit unless each
member of the class has suffered the same type and degree of injury.
Additionally, the bill would \[have\] require\[d\] asbestos trusts to
issue quarterly reports on claims made against the trusts and payouts
made by the trusts for asbestos-related injuries." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 220 to 201. The Senate
took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 148,

-   **By Requiring Injury To Be The Same And Scope, It Class-Membership
    Could Be Sharply Restricted, Including In Sexual Harassment Cases By
    Requiring Women To Have Been Sexually Harassed By The Same Manager
    In The Same Way.** According to the Washington Post, "Doroshow and
    others said the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act would
    squelch most class-action lawsuits, which typically involve
    plaintiffs with a wide variety of similar complaints. It could
    sharply restrict membership in a class, for example, to women who
    had been sexually harassed in the same way by the same manager, they
    said." \[Washington Post,
