### Safety Standard

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require The Consumer Product Safety
Commission To Issue A Consumer Product Safety Standard For Lithium Ion
Batteries For Fire Prevention Purposes.** In May 2024, Fitzpatrick voted
for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that
would require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to promulgate a
final consumer product safety standard for rechargeable lithium-ion
batteries used in devices like electric bicycles and electric scooters
to protect against the risk of fires caused by such batteries. It would
specify that the standard must include requirements for the charging
equipment associated with such batteries, like charging cables. It also

bill's enactment." The House passed the bill by a vote of 378 to 34.
