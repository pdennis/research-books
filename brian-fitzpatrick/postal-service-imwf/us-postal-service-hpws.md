# U.S. Postal Service

### Changes Before Elections

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Amendment That Would Prohibit The U.S.
Postal Service From Enacting Changes Within 120 Days Before A Federal
Election That Would Affect Delivering Voting Materials.** In March 2021,
Fitzpatrick voted for en bloc amendments no.3 to the For The People Act
which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "bar the U.S. Postal
Service from carrying out any new operational change within 120 days
before a federal election that would restrict the delivery of voting
materials." The vote was on adoption of amendments. The House adopted
the amendments by a vote of 221-207. \[House Vote 55,

### Funding

**2020: Fitzpatrick Voted For Providing \$25 Million In Supplemental
Appropriations To The USPS.** In August 2020, Fitzpatrick voted for
Delivering for America Act that would, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "provide \$25 \[b\]illion in supplemental fiscal 2020
appropriations for the U.S. Postal Service, including \$15 million for
the Postal Service office of the inspector general. It would prohibit
the Postal Service from implementing or approving any change to its
operations or service levels as in effect on Jan. 1, 2020, before the
later of Jan. 31, 2021 or the last day of the COVID-19 public health
emergency, including restrictions on overtime pay for Postal Service
employees or removing mail collection boxes or sorting machines. It
would direct the Postal Service to reverse any initiative or action that
is causing a delay in mail processing or delivery. It would require the
Postal Service to postmark and provide same-day processing for election
mail, such as voter registration forms and mail-in ballots, and to treat
such mail as first class mail." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 257-150. The Senate did not take
substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 182,

-   **The Bill Provided \$25 Billion To The Postal Service Amidst Fears
    That The Trump Administration Was Working To Disenfranchise Voters
    Casting Mail Ballots In The Election.** According to the Washington
    Post, "The House voted Saturday on legislation to provide \$25
    billion to the U.S. Postal Service and explicitly prohibit any
    operational changes amid widespread Democratic fears that the Trump
    administration is trying to disenfranchise millions of Americans
    casting mail ballots this November." \[Washington Post,

-   **The Bill Also Reversed Recent Operational Changes That Could Have
    Delayed Service, Such As Prohibiting The Removal Of Mail-Sorting
    Machines And Mail Boxes.** According to the Washington Post, "In
    addition to the infusion of money for the cash-strapped agency, the
    legislation would ban the removal of mail-sorting machines and
    public mailboxes, reverse any operational changes that could delay
    service and mandate that all official election mail be considered
    'first class.''" \[Washington Post,

-   **The Bill Required The Postal Service To Classify All Election Mail
    As First-Class.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure
    also requires the Postal Service to treat all election mail as
    first-class mail, postmark it with the date of receipt and 'to the
    maximum extent practical' process it the same the day it is
    received." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [8/22/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5991018?6)\]

-   **Trump Had Previously Stated That He Opposed Election Aid And
    Emergency Funding For The Postal Service Because He Wanted To Thwart
    Americans From Voting By Mail.** According to the Washington Post,
    "Trump said earlier this month that he opposed election aid for
    states and an emergency bailout for the Postal Service because he
    wants to restrict how many Americans can vote by mail. The
    president, who has voted by mail, has repeatedly made the baseless
    claim that mail-in ballots can lead to widespread fraud while
    criticizing the Postal Service in recent months, calling it a
    'joke."' \[Washington Post,

-   **The White House Issued A Veto Threat On The Bill, Stating That The
    Postal Service Needed A Long-Term Plan Rather Than A Bailout.** The
    White House issued a veto threat, saying the House bill 'seeks to
    exploit the COVID-19 pandemic as a pretext for placing
    counterproductive restrictions on USPS's already limited operational
    flexibilities.' The Postal Service needs an overhaul that will
    ensure its long-term financial self-sufficiency, not a \$25 billion
    'bailout,' the statement of administration policy on the bill
    argued." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [8/22/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5991018?6)\]

-   **McConnell Refused To Take Up The Bill In The Senate, And Other
    Republicans Argued That The Bill Was Unnecessary.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,
    R-KY., has said his chamber won't take up the House bill but that
    Republicans are open to considering Postal Service funding as part
    of a COVID-19 Relief package \[...\] McCarthy argued the emergency
    funding in the bill isn't needed because the Postal Service is
    projected to be financially solvent through August 2021, that the
    removal of mailboxes is 'routine maintenance' that also occurred
    under former President Barack Obama's tenure and that the Postal
    Service has more than enough capacity to deliver election mail."
