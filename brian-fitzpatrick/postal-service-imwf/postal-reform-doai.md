    Washington Post, "The Postal Service has endured years of losses
    triggered by slumping mail volumes and a 2006 bill that required it
    to annually pre-fund retirees' health-care costs. Declines in mail
    revenue have forced the agency to default on those health-care
    payments since 2011." \[The Washington Post,
