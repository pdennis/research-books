### Funding

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Omnibus Spending Proposal Preventing
Another Government Shutdown And Providing \$1.9 Billion For Amtrak.** In
February 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for the FY 2019 consolidated
appropriations bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "This
Conference Summary describes the agreement on H J Res 31, Consolidated
Appropriations Act for FY 2019, which provides detailed, full-year
funding for all seven remaining FY 2019 spending bills ---thereby
completing the FY 2019 appropriations process. The centerpiece, Homeland
Security, provides \$1.375 billion for new and replacement barriers
along the U.S. border with Mexico, including 55 miles of new fencing,
along with an increase of \$1.5 billion in other border security funding
--- such as for new technology at ports of entry and additional Customs
officers. Outside of the Homeland bill, it includes another \$1.6
billion for border security, as well as a 1.9% pay increase for federal
civilian employees." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill
by a vote of 300 to 128. The bill was later signed into law by the
president. \[House Vote 87,

-   **The Bill Appropriated \$1.9 Billion For Amtrak, Equal To FY 2018
    Funding.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The agreement
    provides \$1.9 billion for Amtrak (formally the National Railroad
    Passenger Corporation) --- equal to 2018 funding but \$1.2 billion
    more than requested. Of the total provided, \$650 million is for
    Amtrak's Northeast Corridor operations (equal to FY 2018 and \$450
    million more than requested) and \$1.3 billion is for Amtrak's
    National Network (equal to FY 2018 and \$754 million more than
    requested). The measure requires at least \$50 million be used to
    bring Amtrak-served facilities and stations on the Northeast
    Corridor into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act,
    and that another \$50 million or more be used for railroad safety
    technology, including positive train control, on Amtrak's National
    Network. The measure continues to limit overtime to \$35,000 per
    employee --- but it allows Amtrak's president to waive this
    restriction for specific employees for safety or operational
    efficiency reasons. Amtrak must submit to Congress a report on
    overtime payments made in FY 2018 and the three previous years. It
    directs Amtrak to discount passenger fares for veterans as it does
    for active duty military personnel, and to maintain a station agent
    at each Amtrak station that had a ticket agent in FY 2018."

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating Amtrak Operating
Grants and Capital Grants.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against
a budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal
2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by
\$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending
at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas
Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and
would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense
account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and
would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into
a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs,
such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was
an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC
budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555,

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating Funding For Amtrak.** According to
    the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Eliminate Amtrak
    Operating Grants and Capital Grants The federal government has
    subsidized the National Railroad Passenger Corporation - better
    known as Amtrak - since it was created by Congress in 1970. The
    railroad service is a notoriously poor fiscal manager, losing \$72
    million on food and beverage service alone in 2012. But Amtrak has
    no incentive to improve its performance if it is able to count on
    the taxpayers for a bailout each year. The federal government should
    not force taxpayers to subsidize Amtrak, which should be privatized.
    Eliminating Amtrak funding beginning in FY 2018 would save taxpayers
    \$1.4 billion annually." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Eliminating \$1.1 Billion In Amtrak
Grants.** In September 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against an amendment that
would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "eliminate\[d\] \$1.1
billion in funding for grants to the National Railroad Passenger
Corporation (operating as Amtrak)." The underlying legislation was a
legislative vehicle for an FY 2018 Omnibus appropriations bill. The
House rejected the amendment by a vote of 128 to 293. \[House Vote 449,
