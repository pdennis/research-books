### Advanced Air Mobility Infrastructure

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require The Transportation Department To
Form An Interagency Working Group To Advance The Development Of Advanced
Air Mobility (AAM) Systems, Specifically Passenger Aircraft, And Develop
An AAM National Strategy.** In June 2022, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Advanced Air Mobility Coordination
and Leadership Act, which would "require the Transportation Department
to establish an interagency working group to coordinate efforts related
to advancing the development of advanced air mobility (AAM) systems in
the United States, particularly passenger aircraft. It would require the
working group to develop and submit to Congress an AAM national
strategy, including recommendations regarding the safety, operations,
infrastructure, security, air traffic concepts and federal investment or
actions needed to support the evolution of early AAM, as well as a plan
detailing the responsibilities of federal, state and local governments
to implement the recommendations. In preparing the strategy, it would
require the working group to examine, among other factors, air traffic
management and safety concepts relevant to higher levels of traffic
density; existing federal programs that could be leveraged to advance
the AAM industry; infrastructure needed to support expanded operations
of AAM; and steps to ensure a robust domestic supply chain." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 380-30, thus the
bill was sent to the President. \[House Vote 268,

-   **The Bill Would Unlock Some Funding Authorized By The Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Package Passed In November 2021 Once Signed Into
    Law.** According to CNN, "The passage of the spending bill would
    allow the release of some of the funding authorized by the
    bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which passed in
    November. Due to a budgeting quirk, some of the money cannot be
    spent until the fiscal year 2022 appropriations measure is signed
    into law. The restriction affects a portion of the funds slated for
    the federal highway program and public transit programs, for
    example." \[CNN,
    [3/9/22](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/politics/government-omnibus-spending-bill-2022/index.html)\]

-   **The Bill Provided \$4 Billion For Rural Development Programs,
    Including For Broadband Service Expansion And The ReConnect
    Program.** According to Time, "After 2021's bipartisan
    infrastructure bill provided a \$65 billion investment in rural
    infrastructure to increase broadband access, the latest spending
    measure invests an additional \$4 billion for rural development
    programs. Of that amount, \$550 million will go towards the
    expansion of broadband service and \$450 million for the ReConnect
    program, which provides loans and grants to cover the cost of
    broadband construction and improvement." \[Time,
    [3/9/22](https://time.com/6156432/spending-bill-ukraine-whats-in/)\]

-   **The Bill Provided \$1.45 Billion For Rural Water And Waste Program
    Loans And Over \$653 Million To Provide Safe Drinking Water And
    Sanitary Waste Disposal Systems.** According to Time, "Additional
    spending will be invested in basic utility infrastructure, including
    \$1.45 billion for rural water and waste program loans and over
    \$653 million in grants to provide safe drinking water and sanitary
    waste disposal systems." \[Time,
    [3/9/22](https://time.com/6156432/spending-bill-ukraine-whats-in/)\]

transportation trust funds for federal highway, transit and aviation

### Prioritizing Grants For Defense Entities

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Amendment That Would Require The
Transportation Department To Prioritize Eligible Entities That
Collaborate With The Defense Department Or National Guard When Awarding
Advanced Air Mobility Infrastructure Grants.** In July 2023, according
to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for an amendment to the

Infrastructure Pilot Program, to also prioritize eligible entities that
collaborate with the Defense Department or National Guard." The vote was
on the adoption of an amendment. The House adopted the amendment by a
vote of 220 to 215. \[House Vote 347,

-   **Congressman Rick Larsen (D) Argued The Amendment Would Hinder The
    Original Intent Of The Aircraft Technology Grants To Help State,
    Local And Tribal Governments.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "Another amendment from Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich.,
    adopted in a 220-215 vote, would require the Transportation
    Department, in the process of prioritizing awarding grants under the
    Advanced Air Mobility Infrastructure Pilot Program, to also
    prioritize eligible entities that collaborate with the Defense
    Department or National Guard. Larsen asked members to oppose
    Huizenga\'s amendment earlier Wednesday, saying the language would
    take away from the original intent of the provision to help state,
    local and tribal governments to be a part of the future of aircraft
    technology. The pilot program language in the underlying bill comes
    from Larsen, who introduced a similar version in the 117th Congress
    that passed the House but was not considered in the Senate."
