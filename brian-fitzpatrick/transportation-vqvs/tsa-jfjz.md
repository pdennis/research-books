### Accessibility Of TSA Materials

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted To Improve The Accessibility Of Transportation
Security Administration Materials For Non-English Speakers And People
With Vision, Hearing And Other Impairments.** In November 2021,
Fitzpatrick voted for TSA Reaching Across Nationalities, Societies, and
Languages to Advance Traveler Education Act which would, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "require the Transportation Security
Administration to submit a plan to Congress to improve the accessibility
of TSA materials disseminated in major airports for non-English speakers
and individuals with vision, hearing and other impairments." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 369-49. \[House
