### Grants For Critical Infrastructure

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Establish A Grant Program For State And
Local Governments To Utilize Small Unmanned Drones To Help With Critical
Infrastructure Projects And A Grant Program For Educational Institutions
To Provide Workforce Training On Drones.** In September 2022, according
to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Drone
Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act, which would "require the
Transportation Department to establish a grant program for state and
local governments to use small unmanned aircraft systems, or drones, to
assist in critical infrastructure projects, as well as a grant program
for educational institutions to offer workforce training related to
drones. It would authorize \$50 million annually in fiscal years 2023
and 2024 for each program and require the department, within one year of
enactment, to report to Congress describing and evaluating the
effectiveness of the grants to state and local governments." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 308-110. The
Senate did not take substantive action on the bill. \[House Vote 422,
