# Federal Highway Administration

### Electric Vehicles

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Disapproving A Federal Highway
Administration Rule Regarding Electric Vehicle Chargers.** In January
2024, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted against
"the joint resolution that would provide for congressional disapproval
of a February 2023 Federal Highway Administration Rule that temporarily
waives, for electric vehicle chargers assembled in the U.S., a
requirement that steel, iron, manufactured products and construction
materials used in FHWA projects be produced in the U.S. The rule went
into effect in March 2023 and phases out coverage under the waiver for
chargers manufactured after June 2024 for which the cost of components
manufactured in the U.S. is not more than 55 percent of the cost of all
components. Under the provisions of the joint resolution, the rule would
have no force or effect." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
resolution by a vote of 209 to 198, thus it was sent to the President.
