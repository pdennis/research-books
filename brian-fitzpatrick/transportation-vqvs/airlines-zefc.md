### Reinstating Pilots That Refused COVID-19 Vaccine

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted Against An Amendment That Would Have Required
Airlines To Reinstate Pilots Who Were Fired Due To Their Failure To
Comply With COVID-19 Vaccine Requirements.** In July 2023, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted against an amendment to the
Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act, which
would "require airlines to reinstate pilots who were fired or forced to
resign because of COVID-19 vaccine mandates." The vote was on the
adoption of an amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote of
141 to 294. \[House Vote 346,
