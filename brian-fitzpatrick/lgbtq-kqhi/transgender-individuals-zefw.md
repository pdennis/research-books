lost or left their job due to domestic violence, sexual assault or other
harassment. The measure also expands existing prohibitions on the
ability of individuals to purchase firearms if they have been convicted

well as individuals subject to temporary court restraining orders, and

and store firearms from individuals convicted of domestic violence.

segregated housing unit, unless she presents an immediate risk of harm."

    Administration's Ban On Transgender People Serving In The
    Military.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House adopted
    an amendment blocking the Pentagon from enforcing Trump's ban on
    transgender people from serving openly in the military. The
    provision, authored by Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., is sure to be
    contested in the Republican-controlled Senate whenever compromise
    legislation is considered." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/19/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5573032?11)\]

Americans From Serving In The Military.** In March 2019, Fitzpatrick
voted for a resolution that would, according to Politico, "rebuffed a
move by the Trump administration to restrict transgender individuals
from serving in the military. Voting 238-185, the House approved a
nonbinding resolution opposing transgender troop limits just weeks
before the Pentagon's new policy is set to take effect. \[...\]
Democrats have hammered Trump and the Pentagon for undoing the policy on
a whim without consulting military leaders. \[...\] The Pentagon, which
was caught flat-footed by Trump's abrupt announcement, has since refined
the final policy under former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. The new
guidelines are not a blanket ban on transgender individuals serving in
the military, but, among other provisions, they would require troops
diagnosed with gender dysphoria after the policy takes effect to serve
in their biological sex. They would also bar people with a history of
gender dysphoria from joining unless they've been medically stable in
their biological sex for 36 months and haven't transitioned." The vote
was on the resolution. The House agreed to the resolution by a vote of
238 to 185. \[House Vote 135,
