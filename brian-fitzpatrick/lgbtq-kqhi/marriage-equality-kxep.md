# Marriage Equality

### Changing Federal Definition Of Marriage

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Replace The Federal Definition Of Marriage
With A Definition That Recognized All Valid Marriages In Every U.S.
State.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted to concur with the Senate amendment to the Respect for
Marriage Act, which would "also replace the current federal definition
of marriage, which defines marriage as a union between one man and one
woman, to define a marriage as valid if it is between two individuals
and valid in the place where the marriage was entered into and would be
considered valid in a U.S. state." The vote was on a motion to concur.
The House concurred with the Senate by a vote of 258-169, thus the bill
was sent to President Biden and it ultimately became law. \[House Vote

-   **The Bill Would Repeal The Defense Of Marriage Act Of 1996, Which
    Defined Marriage Between One Man And One Woman And Was Previously
    Struck Down But Remained In Federal Code.** According to The New
    York Times, "The legislation passed on Tuesday would repeal the
    Defense of Marriage Act of 1996, which defined a marriage as the
    union between a man and a woman, a law that was struck down by the
    court but has remained on the books." \[New York Times,

-   **The Bill Would Recognize Marriages If They Were Valid In The State
    The Ceremony Was Performed, Which Would Recognize Marriages In
    States That Would Prohibit Sex-Marriages If Obergefell Were To Be
    Overturned.** According to The New York Times, "The legislation
    would mandate that the federal government recognize a marriage if it
    was valid in the state where it was performed, which would address
    the patchwork of differing state laws. That would protect same-sex
    marriages in the roughly 30 states that currently prohibit them,
    should the court overturn Obergefell." \[New York Times,

### Codifying The Right To Marry

**2022: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted For The Respect For Marriage
Act.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted for the "motion to table the Perlmutter, D-Colo.,
motion to reconsider the vote by which the House agreed, 258-169, to
concur in the Senate amendment to the bill." The vote was on a moton to
table a motion to reconsider the previous vote. The House agreed to the
motion by a vote of 224-164, thus the previous passage vote of H.R. 8404
was not reconsidered and the bill remained as passed. \[House Vote 514,

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Codify The Right To Marry, Regardless Of
Sexual Orientation Or Race And Prohibit Individuals Acting Under State
Law From Refusing To Recognize A Same-Sex Or Interracial Marriage.** In
December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted
to concur with the Senate amendment to the Respect for Marriage Act,
which would "codify the right to marry, regardless of sexual orientation
or race. Specifically, it would prohibit any person acting under color
of state law from denying full faith and credit to, or any rights based
on, a marriage between two individuals on the basis of the individuals\'
sex, race, ethnicity or national origin. It would allow the U.S.
attorney general or a harmed individual to bring a civil action in U.S.
district court for declaratory and injunctive relief against an
individual who violates these provisions. The bill would also replace
the current federal definition of marriage, which defines marriage as a
union between one man and one woman, to define a marriage as valid if it
is between two individuals and valid in the place where the marriage was
entered into and would be considered valid in a U.S. state. It would
specify that no provisions in the bill may be construed to diminish or
abrogate religious liberty and that religious organizations and their
employees would not be required to provide services for the celebration
of a marriage, consistent with First Amendment protections. It would
also specify that the bill would not authorize federal recognition of
polygamous marriage and that it would not impact any benefits, status or
rights that do not arise from marriage." The vote was on a motion to
concur. The House concurred with the Senate by a vote of 258-169, thus
the bill was sent to President Biden and it ultimately became law.

-   **The Bill Did Not Recognize Polygamous Marriages And Did Not Impact
    The Benefits, Status Or Rights That Do Not Derive From Marriage.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "It would also specify that
    the bill would not authorize federal recognition of polygamous
    marriage and that it would not impact any benefits, status or rights
    that do not arise from marriage." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [12/8/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/513?18)\]

-   **The Bill Would Not Require State To Legalize Same-Sex Marriage,
    But Instead Required States To Recognize Out-Of-State Legal
    Marriages.** According to CNN, "While the bill would not set a
    national requirement that all states must legalize same-sex
    marriage, it would require individual states to recognize another
    state's legal marriage." \[CNN,
    [11/30/22](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/politics/same-sex-marriage-vote-senate/index.html)\]

-   **If Obergefell V. Hodges Were To Be Overturned, And If A State Were
    To Outlaw Same-Sex Marriage, The Respect For Marriage Act Would
    Mandate Such State To Recognize Same-Sex Marriages That Were
    Conducted In Other States.** According to CNN, "So, in the event the
    Supreme Court might overturn its 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision
    that legalized same-sex marriage, a state could still pass a law to
    ban same-sex marriage, but that state would be required to recognize
    a same-sex marriage from another state." \[CNN,
    [11/30/22](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/politics/same-sex-marriage-vote-senate/index.html)\]

-   **Specifically, The Bill Was In Response To Justice Clarence Thomas'
    Row V. Wade Concurring Opinion, In Which He Called For Obergefell To
    Be Reconsidered.** According to The New York Times, "It is a direct
    answer to Justice Clarence Thomas's concurring opinion in last
    month's ruling that overturned federal abortion rights, in which he
    wrote that Obergefell and similar cases should be reconsidered."
    \[New York Times,
    [7/19/22](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/us/politics/house-gay-marriage-bill.html)\]

-   **While The Bill Did Not Fully Guarantee The Right To Marry, It
    Required States To Recognize Out-Of-State Same-Sex Marriages And
    Codified The Rights For Same-Sex Couples To Receive The Same Federal
    Benefits Like Heterosexual Couples.** According to NPR, "This bill
    does not guarantee the right to marry. It makes it so that other
    states have to recognize same-sex marriages across state lines and
    that same-sex couples are entitled to the same federal benefits of
    any other married couple, like Social Security survivor benefits."
    \[NPR,

-   **The Bill Would Not Prevent States From Banning Same-Sex Marriage
    If The Supreme Court Overturns Obergefell.** According to NPR,
    "That's because, though the bill attempts to buttress key Supreme
    Court decisions, it does nothing to prevent same-sex marriages from
    becoming illegal again in states that might oppose them if the
    Supreme Court decides to overturn Obergefell." \[NPR,

**2022: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against The Respect For Marriage
Act.** In December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted against the "adoption of the rule (H Res 1510) that
would provide for floor consideration of the Respect for Marriage Act
(HR 8404). The rule would provide for up to one hour of debate on a
motion to concur in the Senate amendment to HR 8404." The vote was on
the adoption of the rule. The House adopted the rule by a vote of
217-204. \[House Vote 512,

    To Sue In Federal Court For "Declaratory And Injustice Relief"
    Against Anyone That Denies The Right To Marry.** According to

    Supreme Court Could Overturn Marriage Equality.** According to The
    New York Times, "The House on Tuesday passed a bill that would
    recognize same-sex marriages at the federal level, with a bipartisan
    coalition supporting a measure that addresses growing concerns that

-   **The Bill Would Codify The 2015 Supreme Court Landmark Case
    Obergefell V. Hodges, Which Protected Gay Marriage As A 14th
    Amendment Right.** According to The New York Times, "Forty-seven
    Republicans joined Democrats in backing the bill, the Respect for
    Marriage Act, which would codify the federal protections for
    same-sex couples that were put in place in 2015, when the Supreme
    Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges established same-sex marriage
    as a right under the 14th Amendment." \[New York Times,

-   **The Bill Would Provide The U.S. Attorney General The Authority To
    Enforce The Bill.** According to The New York Times, "The bill also
