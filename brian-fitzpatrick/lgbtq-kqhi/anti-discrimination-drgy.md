### Equality Act

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Equality Act, Which Would Provide
LGBTQ Anti-Discriminatory Protections By Prohibiting Discrimination On
The Basis Of Sex, Sexual Orientation And Gender Identity Under The 1964
Civil Rights Act.** In February 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for the Equality
Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "prohibit
discrimination or segregation based on sex, sexual orientation and
gender identity under 1964 Civil Rights Act protections, including in
public facilities, public education, federal assistance programs,
employment, jury service and areas of public accommodation." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 224-206. \[House

-   **Democrats Argued That The Equality Act Would Aid People From
    Losing Their Homes Or Employment On The Basis Of Their Sexual
    Orientation Or Gender Identity.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "Democrats who supported the bill (HR 5) argued it would
    prevent people from losing their homes or jobs on the basis of
    sexual orientation or gender identity." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/25/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6137848?2)\]

-   **Republicans Claimed The Equality Act Would Hinder Religious
    Freedom And Put Women In Danger.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "In floor debate over the measure, Republicans claimed
    the bill would stomp on religious freedom and potentially endanger
    women. Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., argued the bill would allow men
    access to 'traditionally women spaces' such as shelters."

    [2/25/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6137848?2)\]

-   **According To The Human Rights Campaign, At Least 70% Of The Public
    Supported The Equality Act.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "David Stacy, the government affairs director for the LGBTQ rights
    group Human Rights Campaign, said that federal law already provides
    protections for religious freedom and cited significant public
    support for the bill. His organization has cited polls conducted by
    HRC and others showing 70 percent or more of the public support the
    bill." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/25/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6137848?2)\]

-   **According To Various Democrats, The Equality Act Would Not Hinder
    Religious Liberty, But Instead Grant Gender Identity And Sexual
    Orientation The Same Protections As Other Established Categories
    Within Civil Rights Law.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Democrats like Cicilline said the bill doesn\'t touch religious
    liberty exemptions that already exist in the law. It only gives
    sexual orientation and gender identity the same protections as other
    categories such as race. 'All of the other areas of civil rights law
    have established religious exemptions, they would apply in the same
    way to the provisions of the Equality Act. The LGBTQ community is
    not looking for more protections, nor are we willing to accept
    less,' Cicilline said." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/25/21](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-6137848?5)\]

-   **Several Religious Groups Lobbied Against The Equality Act And
    Claimed The Measure Challenged Religious Liberties By Not Creating
    Religious Exemptions.** According to The Washington Post, "A number
    of religious denominations, however, are lobbying against the
    measure, saying its lack of religious exemptions creates one of the
    most sweeping challenges to religious liberty in decades." \[The

-   **Several Religious Groups Claimed The Equality Act Would Prevent
    Free And Low-Cost Meals For Children Who Attend Single-Gender
    Religious Schools, Require Religious Community Centers To Rent Space
    To Conduct LGBTQ Ceremonies, And "Threaten Federal Security Grants
    For Synagogues And Mosques Facing Violence."** According to The
    Washington Post, "Groups including the Church of Jesus Christ of
    Latter-day Saints, Orthodox Jews and Seventh-day Adventists, among
    others, say it could halt free and reduced-cost lunches for children
    across the country who attend single-gender parochial schools,
    require church community halls to rent space for LGBTQ ceremonies,
    and threaten federal security grants for synagogues and mosques
    facing violence." \[The Washington Post,

-   **On The House Floor, Representative Andrew S. Clyde Of Georgia
    Continuously Called Transgender Women "Biological Males" And Claimed
    The Equality Act Would Infringe Upon Women's Privacy Rights And
    Safety In Locker Rooms And Showers.** According to The Washington
    Post, "In remarks on the House floor Thursday morning, Rep.
    Andrew S. Clyde (R-Ga.) repeatedly referred to transgender women as
    'biological males' and said the Equality Act would violate women's
    right to privacy and safety in locker rooms and showers. 'God help
    us,' Clyde said. 'Have we lost our ever-loving minds?'" \[The
    Washington Post,

-   **Representative Randy Weber Of Texas Claimed The Equality Act Was
    An "Anti-Life, Anti-Family And Anti-Faith" Bill And Representative
    Yvette Herrell Of New Mexico Claimed It Would Transition The Country
    Away From Judeo-Christian Values And Take Away Parental Choice.**
    According to The Washington Post, "Rep. Randy Weber (R-Tex.) called
    the bill 'anti-life, anti-family and anti-faith,' while Rep. Yvette
    Herrell (R-N.M.) said it 'moves our nation away from our
    Judeo-Christian values and takes away parents' rights to decide.'"

-   **The Equality Act Would Modify The Civil Rights Act Of 1964 To
    Include Protections Against Discrimination Based On Sexual
    Orientation And Gender Identity.** According to NPR, "The Equality
    Act would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to explicitly prevent

-   **An Entity Would Not Be Able To Use The Religious Freedom
    Restoration Act Of 1993 To Challenge The Equality Act's Provisions,
    Nor Would It Be Used As A Defense To A Claim.** According to NPR,
    "Under the Equality Act, an entity couldn't use RFRA to challenge
    the act's provisions, nor could it use RFRA as a defense to a claim
    made under the act." \[NPR,

-   **Some Opponents Of The Equality Act Claimed It Would Threaten
    Business And Organizations That Object Serving LGBTQ On The Basis Of
    Religious Objections And Force Them To Choose Between Their Beliefs
    Or Continuing To Operate.** According to NPR, "Another key fear
    among opponents of the Equality Act is that it would threaten
    businesses or organizations that have religious objections to
    serving LGBTQ people, forcing them to choose between operating or
    following their beliefs." \[NPR,

-   **2020: The Supreme Court Ruled That He Civil Rights Act Of 1964
    Protections On The Basis Of Sex Extended To LGBTQ Individuals.**
    According to CBS News, "Last year, the Supreme Court issued a ruling
    stating that the protections guaranteed by the 1964 Civil Rights Act
    on the basis of sex extended to discrimination against LGBTQ
    Americans." \[CBS News,
    [2/26/21](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-passes-equality-act-lgbtq-american-rights/)\]

-   **The Equality Act Would Place Protections Against Discrimination
    Based On Sexual Orientation And Gender Identity, Instead Of Having
    Those Protections Under The Broad Term Of "Sex."** According to CBS
    News, "The Equality Act would explicitly set those protections for
    people based on orientation and gender identity, as opposed to
    having those safeguards included under the umbrella term of 'sex.'"
    \[CBS News,
    [2/26/21](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-passes-equality-act-lgbtq-american-rights/)\]

-   **The Equality Act Would Benefit Members Of The LGBTQ Community And
    Women, Who Would No Longer Be Denied Services By Health Care
    Establishments.** According to Center For American Progress, "The
    Equality Act would establish sex and SOGI protections in public
    accommodations. This means that businesses open to the public, such
    as restaurants and pharmacies, would face accountability if they
    discriminate against, mistreat, or refuse to serve LGBTQ
    individuals. These amendments would not only benefit LGBTQ
    individuals; all women could no longer be charged higher prices than
    men for equivalent services or be denied services by establishments
    that provide health care." \[Center For American Progress,
    [3/15/21](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/need-know-equality-act/)\]

-   **The Equality Act Would Expand The Range Of Public Accommodations
    To Include Health Care Providers.** According to Center For American
    Progress, "By expanding the range of public accommodations
    recognized under civil rights law, the Equality Act would ensure
    protections for race, color, religion, national origin, and sex,
    including SOGI, in public spaces, including retail stores,
    transportation, and health care providers." \[Center For American
    Progress,
    [3/15/21](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/need-know-equality-act/)\]

-   **Op-Ed: By Adding "Sex" To Discrimination Laws That Would Require
    Public Accommodations Regarding Pregnancy, Childbirth Or Related
    Medical Condition, The Equality Act Would Consider A Form Of Sex
    Discrimination For A Health Care Provider To Refuse Abortion
    Services.** According to The Daily Signal op-ed by Melanie Israel,
    "The Equality Act adds the term 'sex' to Title II of the 1964 Civil
    Rights Act on public accommodations to mean pregnancy, childbirth,
    or related medical conditions. Both the Equal Employment Opportunity
    Commission and the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals have interpreted
    'related medical condition' to include abortion. Because of the way
    the Equality Act is drafted, this new definition of sex
    discrimination---understood to include a medical condition such as
    abortion---would be applied to areas of law, such as federally
    assisted programs, public accommodations, and Obamacare's
    nondiscrimination provision. In practice, it could mean that a
    health care provider would be discriminating on the basis of sex if
    they refused to perform an abortion procedure; a hospital could be
    discriminating on the basis of sex if it refused to allow abortions
    to take place within its facility; and health insurance plans could
    be discriminating on the basis of sex if they do not include
    coverage for elective abortions." \[Melanie Israel Op-Ed -- The

Congressional Quarterly, "expand the definition of 'public

    LGBTQ Individuals Against Discrimination In Employment, Public
    Accommodations And Housing.** According to The Washington Post, "In
    the ensuing decades, public opinion has shifted dramatically toward
    support of such protections. More than 8 in 10 Americans favor laws

-   **The Equality Act Would Amend Civil Rights Laws To Guarantee

-   **The Equality Act Would Expand Public Accommodations And Covered
    Discrimination To Federally Funded Programs.** According to NPR,
    "The Civil Rights Act covered discrimination in certain areas, like
    employment and housing. The Equality Act would expand that to cover
    federally funded programs, as well as 'public accommodations' --- a
    broad category including retail stores and stadiums, for example."

-   **The Equality Act Would Broaden The Definition Of Public
    Accommodations To Expand To Online Retailers And Transportation
    Providers, Thus Racial And Religious Discrimination Would Also Be
    Covered Under Those Establishments.** According to NPR, "'Public
    accommodations' is also a category that the bill broadens, to
    include online retailers and transportation providers, for example.
    Because of that, many types of discrimination the Civil Rights Act
    currently prohibits --- like racial or religious discrimination ---
    would now also be explicitly covered at those types of
    establishments." \[NPR,
