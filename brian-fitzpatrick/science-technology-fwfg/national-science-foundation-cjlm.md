### Digital Privacy Technologies

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Award Grants For Research On
Privacy-Enhancing Technologies.** In April 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for ,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would
direct the National Science Foundation to award grants to support
research on privacy-enhancing technologies, including algorithms and
location tracking, to mitigate individual\'s privacy risks and improve
the privacy of online activity. It would also permit the NSF to issue
research awards to support education and workforce training and research
on human behavior to help design better privacy solutions, as well as to
create freely available privacy-enhancing technology libraries. It would
emphasize research on privacy-enhancing technologies as part of NSF's
overall computer science research mission. It would require any personal
data collected in the course of NSF-funded research to be treated in
accordance with federal privacy regulations. It would require the White
House Office of Science and Technology Policy to report to Congress
within three years of the bill's enactment on its progress researching
privacy-enhancing technologies and any policy recommendations to improve
privacy." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote
of 354 to 36. \[House Vote 154,

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Require The National Science Foundation To
Support Privacy-Enhancing Technologies That Diminish Individuals'
Privacy Risks Arising From Data Processing.** In May 2022, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Promoting Digital
Privacy Technologies Act, which would "require the National Science
Foundation to support research on privacy-enhancing technologies that
mitigate individuals\' privacy risks arising from data processing by
improving data predictability, manageability, dissociability and
confidentiality. It would also require the Office of Science and
Technology Policy to coordinate with the NSF and other federal agencies
to accelerate the development and adoption of such technologies and to
report to Congress on related research and development." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 401-19, thus the bill
was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 150,
