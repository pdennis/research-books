# National Telecommunications And Information Administration Act

### Reauthorization

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Reauthorize The National Telecommunications
And Information Administration Act For Two Years With New Initiatives
And Reporting Requirements.** In May 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for ,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would
reauthorize the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration Act for two years, authorize \$57 million annually
through fiscal 2025 for NTIA, and codify certain offices that have been
created within the NTIA. It would establish new initiatives, including
efforts to account for changing technologies and focus on boosting the
U.S. digital economy by enhancing spectrum management, improving
broadband funding, developing policies related to the cybersecurity of
communications networks, improving public safety communications and
reviewing certain telecommunications providers that have foreign owners.
It would consolidate the NTIA's reporting requirements by directing the
agency to submit to Congress one annual report that contains data
related to various offices and initiatives, as well as the COVID-19
Telehealth Program and the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund
and Multilateral Security and Digital Equity grant programs. It would
elevate the NTIA administrator from 'assistant secretary of Commerce for
Communications and Information' to 'undersecretary of Commerce for
Communications and Information.'" The House passed the bill by a vote of
374 to 36. \[House Vote 205,
