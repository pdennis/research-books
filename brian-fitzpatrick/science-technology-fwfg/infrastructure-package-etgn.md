# Bipartisan Infrastructure Package

### Cybersecurity Resilience Programs

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted To Grant More Than \$1.7 Billion For
Cybersecurity Resilience Programs.** In November 2021, Fitzpatrick voted
for concurring in the Senate amendment to the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act which would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide
more than \$1.7 billion for cybersecurity resilience programs." The vote
was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment. The House concurred
with the Senate by a vote of 228-206, thus the bill was sent to the
President and ultimately became law. \[House Vote 369,
