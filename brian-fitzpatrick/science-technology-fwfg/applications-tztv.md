### Foreign Ownership

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Prohibit Technology Platforms From Carrying
Applications Owned By Foreign Adversaries, Including TikTok.** In March
2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly, "the
bill (HR 7521), as amended, that would prohibit technology platforms in
the U.S. from carrying any applications, such as TikTok, that are
controlled by foreign adversaries, unless they are divested and no
longer under such control. It would prohibit technology platforms,
including app stores and internet hosting services from distributing,
maintaining, updating or enabling the distribution in the U.S. of any
application that is controlled by a foreign adversary. It would
automatically define as a foreign adversary-controlled application any
website, app or related source code operated directly by or through a
subsidiary or affiliate of ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. It
would specify that any technology platform that violates the bill's
regulations could be subject to fines or other enforcement by the
Justice Department. HR 7521 is the Protecting Americans from Foreign
Adversary Controlled Applications Act." The vote was on passage. The
House passed the bill by a vote of 352 to 65. \[House Vote 86,
