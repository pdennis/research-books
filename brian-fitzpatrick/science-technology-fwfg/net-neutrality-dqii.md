# Net Neutrality

### Block The FCC's Net Neutrality Order

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Blocking The FCC's Regulation
Protecting Net Neutrality.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against
a budget resolution that would in part, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal
2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by
\$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending
at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas
Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and
would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense
account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and
would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into
a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs,
such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was
an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC
budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555,

-   **Budget Called For Blocking The FCC's Regulation Protecting Net
    Neutrality.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018
    Budget, "Stop Net Neutrality A free and open Internet has been one
    of the greatest catalysts for innovation, opportunity, and economic
    growth. Rigid government regulation of the Internet will only stifle
    prosperity and progress. Congress should repeal the Federal
    Communication Commission's rule of February 26, 2015, reclassifying
    broadband Internet access as a telecommunication service under Title
    II of the Communications Act of 1934. This proposal is based on the
    Internet Freedom Act, introduced by Representative Marsha
    Blackburn." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed

### Restore Net Neutrality

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Restoring The 2015 FCC Rules
Establishing Net Neutrality And Overturning The 2017 FCC Order
Overturning Net Neutrality.** In April 2019, Fitzpatrick voted against a
bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "reverse the Federal
Communications Commission\'s Dec. 2017 decision related to regulation of
broadband internet services, which classified internet service as an
\"information service\" to be regulated under Title I FCC authorities.
It would effectively restore and codify a 2015 FCC regulatory framework
and any other rules repealed or amended by the 2017 decision. The
restored framework would classify internet service as a
'telecommunications service' to be regulated under certain Title II FCC
authorities, and restored rules would include prohibitions on blocking
and paid prioritization of content by internet service providers. The
restored rules would be effective retroactively, and the bill would
prohibit the FCC from effectively reissuing the nullified rules. It
would also exempt small broadband internet providers from certain public
disclosure requirements related to network management practices,
performance, or commercial terms, for one year after enactment." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 232 to 190.
