### Precipitation Estimation Research

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Authorize \$1.5 Million For The National
Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration To Study The Research Needs Of
Precipitation Estimation To Inform Local Governments and Emergency
Management Agencies On Flood Risk And Infrastructure Planning.** In
December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted
to concur with the Senate amendment with a further House amendment to
the Further Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2023, which
would "provide funding for federal government operations and services
through Dec. 23, 2022, at fiscal 2022 levels. It would extend, for the
duration of the continuing resolution, a number of expiring programs and
authorities extended by the prior continuing resolution (PL 117-180),
including the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, the
National Flood Insurance Program, the U.S. Parole Commission, the Indian
Health Service, the Federal Communications Commission's authority to
auction radio spectrum and issue licenses, and various Medicare and
other health care authorities, offset by a reduction of \$30 million for
the Medicare Improvement Fund." The vote was on a motion to concur. The
House concurred with the Senate by a vote of 224-201, thus the bill was
sent to the Senate for final concurrence. The Senate concurred with the
House, sent the bill to President Biden, and it ultimately became law
and prevented a government shutdown. \[House Vote 523,
