### Blockchain Deployment Program

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Establish A Blockchain Deployment Program
To Provide Guidance Regarding The Use Of Blockchain And Policy
Recommendations.** In May 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to
Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would direct the
Commerce Department to establish a Blockchain Deployment Program to
support U.S. leadership as it relates to the development, use,
application and competitiveness of blockchain and other related
technology. It would require the department to develop policies and
recommendations for issues and risks related to blockchain technology
and to take actions to support and promote the stability, maintenance,
improvement and security of blockchain technology. The bill would
require the Commerce secretary to serve as the principal advisor to the
president for the deployment and use of blockchain and other related
technologies. It also would require the department to establish advisory
committees to support the adoption of blockchain and related
technologies within 180 days of the bill's enactment. The Blockchain
Deployment Program would terminate seven years after the bill's
enactment. It also would require a report to Congress, within two years
of the bill's enactment and annually every year thereafter, on the
program's activities, recommendations as well as all activities under
the bill regarding blockchain and related technologies in the preceding
year." The House passed the bill by a vote of 334 to 79. \[House Vote
