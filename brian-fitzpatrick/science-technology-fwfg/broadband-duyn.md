### Broadband Service Grants

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Expand Broadband Service Grants To Rural
America.** In March 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to
Congressional Quarterly, "the bill (HR 1752), as amended, that would
expand the ability of the Economic Development Administration to support
the deployment of high-speed broadband internet by authorizing EDA to
award grants for broadband projects to public-private partnerships and
consortiums, and by allowing grant recipients to use in-kind donations
to meet non-federal cost-sharing requirements. It would require EDA,
when reviewing grant applications, to seek information from other
federal agencies regarding any existing broadband services, or planned
services, for deployment in the grant application area. The bill also
would stipulate that grant funding could be used for broadband planning,
technical assistance, training, the acquisition or development of land
and the acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, expansion or
improvement of facilities used to provide broadband internet service.
The EDA could provide credit toward the non-federal cost-share of a
project over its useful life. HR 1752 is the Eliminating Barriers to
Rural Internet Development Grant Eligibility (E-BRIDGE) Act." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 375 to 20.

Broadband Service.** In November 2021, Fitzpatrick voted for the

Department to provide grants for projects to improve high-speed
broadband service. It would make public-private entities and consortiums
formed for the purpose of providing, extending, expanding or improving
high-speed broadband service eligible for the grants. Among other
provisions, it would require the department, in reviewing grant
applications, to request information from other federal agencies
regarding existing levels of broadband service in a project\'s proposed
service areas; require grant recipients to vest any property acquired or
improved with grant funds in a public partner or nonprofit for the life
of the project; and allow the department to provide credit toward the
nonfederal share of project costs." The vote was on passage. The House
