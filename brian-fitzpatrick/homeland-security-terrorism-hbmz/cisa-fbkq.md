### Cybersecurity Grants For Schools

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Award Grants And Cooperative Agreements To
States, Localities, Higher Education Institutions And Non-Profits For
Cybersecurity And Infrastructure Security Education And Training In
Schools.** In May 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted for the Cybersecurity Grants for Schools Act of 2022,
which would "authorize the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency to award grants and cooperative agreements to states, local
governments, higher education institutions, nonprofit organizations and
other non-federal entities under the Cybersecurity Education and
Training Assistance Program to advance program purposes and address the
national shortfall of cybersecurity professionals. It would also require
the agency to include in its annual briefing to Congress on the program
information on such grants and agreements, including how they are being
used to enhance cybersecurity education for underserved populations or
communities." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 383-30, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 197,
