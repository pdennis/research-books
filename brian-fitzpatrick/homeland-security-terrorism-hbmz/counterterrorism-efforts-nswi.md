# Counterterrorism Efforts

### Hamas

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted Prevent Financing Of And Other Assistance To
Hamas.** In November 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted for "motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill
that would state that it is U.S. policy to prevent Hamas, Palestinian
Islamic Jihad, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, the Lion's Den, or any affiliate
or successor thereof from accessing its international support networks.
It would also state that it is U.S. policy to oppose such groups from
using goods, including medicine and dual use items, to smuggle weapons
and other materials to further acts of terrorism, including against
Israel. Among other provisions, the bill would require the president to
impose sanctions on foreign individuals and states that engage in
significant financial transactions or provide significant material
support to such groups. It would terminate the bill's provisions seven
years after the date of enactment, unless the president certifies to
Congress at a sooner date that Hamas is no longer designated as a
foreign terrorist organization, or that Hamas and the other listed
terrorist organizations no longer meet the criteria to be subject to
anti-terrorist financing sanctions under U.S. law." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 363 to 46. \[House Vote
