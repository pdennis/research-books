# America COMPETES Act

### Mentor-Protégé Program

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Amendments That Would Remove
Provisions From The America COMPETE Act, Including The Establishment Of
A DHS Mentor-Protégé Program That Would Assist Small Firms In Competing
For DHS Contracts.** In February 2022, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted against en bloc amendments no. 3 to the
America COMPETES Act, which would "strike from the bill \[...\] a
section that would establish a Homeland Security Department
mentor-protege program to assist small firms in competing for DHS
contracts." The vote was on the adoption of amendments. The House
rejected the en bloc amendments by a vote of 204-225. \[House Vote 20,
