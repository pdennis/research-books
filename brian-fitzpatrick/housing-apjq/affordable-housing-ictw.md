**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For The \$1.3 Trillion FY 2018 Omnibus
Spending Deal Which Raised Spending By \$138 Billion Over FY 2017
Levels, Including A \$1.7 Billion Increase In Section 8 Rental
Assistance.** In March 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for the FY 2018 Omnibus
spending bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Combined, the
spending measures would provide about \$1.3 trillion in discretionary
spending, with \$1.2 trillion subject to discretionary spending caps,

and non-defense budget caps set by the two-year budget deal agreed to
last month. That agreement increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80
billion and the non-defense cap by \$63 billion. Given that the previous
caps were set to reduce overall discretionary spending by \$5 billion,
the net increase provided by the omnibus is \$138 billion over the FY
2017 level." The vote was on the motion to concur in the Senate
