### Appraisals

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For Allowing Licensed Appraisers To Conduct
Home Appraisals For Mortgage Backed By The Federal Housing
Administration.** In September 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that
would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "authorize state-licensed
appraisers to conduct appraisals for single-family homes purchased by
Federal Housing Administration-insured mortgages. (Under current law,
such appraisers must be state-certified.) It would require
state-licensed appraisers for single-family housing mortgages to
complete a course consisting of at least 7 hours of training related to
FHA appraisal requirements. It would require HUD to issue guidance to
mortgage lenders outlining how to implement these provisions." The vote
was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed
to the motion and passed the bill by a vote of 419-5. The bill was never
taken up in the Senate. \[House Vote 519,
