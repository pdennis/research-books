# United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement

### Passage

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For The U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) Trade
Agreement.** In December 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for the
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, which would, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "implement the trade agreement reached between
the United States, Mexico, and Canada that replaces the North American
Free-Trade Agreement. It would modify existing trade law to provide for
implementation of the agreement, authorize federal agencies and other
entities to implement and enforce provisions of the agreement, and
authorize or appropriate more than \$2 billion in funding for certain
implementation activities." The vote was on passage. The House passed
the bill by a vote of 385-41. The Senate later passed the bill and the
President signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 701,

-   **Some Democrats Opposed The Deal, Citing A Lack Of Climate Change
    Provisions.** According to Congressional Quarterly, 'several
    dissenting Democrats \[cited\] the absence of climate change
    provisions as a lost opportunity to address the issue on an
    international scale since Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris
    climate agreement." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **Environmental Groups Urged Senators To Vote No On The USMCA.**
    According to The Hill, "nine environmental groups wrote to lawmakers
    urging them to vote against \[the USMCAs\] passage \[...\] The
    coalition specifically lamented that the trade agreement 'does not
    even mention climate change, fails to adequately address toxic
    pollution, includes weak environmental standards and an even weaker
    enforcement mechanism, supports to fossil fuels, and allows oil and
    gas corporations to challenge climate and environmental
    protections.'" \[The Hill,

-   **House Democrats Successfully Fought For The Agreement To Include
    Provisions That Made It More Difficult For U.S. Auto Makers To Shift
    Production To Mexico.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "House
    Democrats had negotiated several changes to the USMCA to make it
    acceptable. Key changes for Democrats included enforcement of labor
    provisions they believe will make it more difficult and expensive
    for U.S. manufacturers, particularly auto makers, to shift
    production to Mexico. The changes won the endorsement of the
    AFL-CIO, but other unions such as the International Association of
    Machinists and Aerospace Workers oppose it." \[Congressional
    Quarterly,

-   **The USMCA Allowed The U.S. To Ensure Mexican Factories Are
    Complying With Workers' Union Rights.** According to Politico, "Some
    of the top labor changes that won over Democrats include provisions
    that will allow the U.S. to file complaints against Mexican
    factories suspected of violating workers' union rights. The revised
    USMCA would allow the U.S. to be part of a multinational team that
    verifies whether factories are complying and can penalize them if
    they do not." \[Politico,

-   **The USMCA Helped American Dairy Farmers Gain Access To Foreign
    Markets.** According to the Washington Post, "The USMCA also gives
    American dairy farmers more access to the Canadian market,
    especially for 'Class 7' milk products such as milk powder and milk
    proteins. The deal puts some restrictions on how much dairy Canada
    can export, which could help American dairy farmers edge into
    foreign markets." \[Washington Post,
    [1/16/20](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/01/16/senate-approves-new-usmca-trade-deal-with-canada-mexico/)\]

-   **The USMCA Gave Technology Companies Immunity From Liability For
    User Content Posted On Their Platforms.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The pact also would give technology companies provisions
    to address e-commerce, which did not exist when NAFTA was
    negotiated. A chapter based on Section 230 of a 1996
    telecommunications law gives companies like Facebook, Google and
    Twitter immunity from liability for user content posted on their
    platforms." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [1/16/20](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5814843?4https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5814843?4)\]

-   **CBO Estimated That The USMCA Would Generate \$2.97 Billion In
    Government Revenue For The U.S. Over 10 Years.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The Congressional Budget Office estimates
    that the USMCA will increase U.S. government revenue by \$2.97
    billion from fiscal 2020 to 2029 due to higher expected duty revenue
    on car and truck parts that do not meet the stricter rules."

-   **The International Trade Commission Estimated That The USMCA Would
    Increase Real GDP By \$68.2 Billion (.35%) And Add 176,000 Jobs In
    The U.S.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The International
    Trade Commission, an independent agency, said the trade agreement,
    'if fully implemented,' over several years would increase real GDP
    by \$68.2 billion, or 0.35 percent, and would add 176,000 jobs to
    the U.S. economy." \[Congressional Quarterly,
