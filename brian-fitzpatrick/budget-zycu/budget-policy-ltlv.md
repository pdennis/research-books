### Balanced Budget Amendment

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted To Amend The Constitution Where The Federal
Government Must Have A Balanced Budget Unless Three-Fifths Of The House
And The Senate Approve Of A Deficit, Except During War.** In April 2018,
Fitzpatrick voted for a resolution that would have added a balanced
budget requirement to the Constitution. According to Congressional
Quarterly, the joint resolution would have "propose\[d\] a
constitutional amendment that would require the U.S. government to
operate under a balanced budget each year, beginning five years after
ratification. Under the proposal, three-fifths of the entire House and
Senate would \[have\] be\[en\] required to approve deficit spending or
an increase in the public debt limit, but a simple majority would
\[have\] be\[en\] sufficient to waive the requirement in times of
congressionally declared war or in the face of a serious military
threat." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass the
resolution, which required a two-thirds majority to pass. The House
rejected the motion by a vote of 233 to 184. \[House Vote 138,

-   **Republican's Tax Bill Was Estimated To Add \$1.9 Trillion To The
    Federal Deficit.** According to the Center for American Progress,
    "When that effort stalled, the majority regrouped and passed even
    bigger tax cuts that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates
    will add nearly \$1.9 trillion to the federal deficit over the next
    10 years, even after taking into account potential growth effects."

-   **Congress Also Passed A \$1.3 Trillion Omnibus Spending Bill That
    Went Above Discretionary Spending Caps.** According to the Hill,
    "That commitment was called into question after Congress last month
    passed a \$1.3 trillion funding package that shattered budget caps
    --- a move that came on the heels of last year's passage of a tax
    package that is also projected to add to the deficit." \[The Hill,
    [4/12/18](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/382915-bid-to-amend-constitution-falls-short-in-the-house)\]

-   **The CBO Found That As Result Of The Tax Bill And Omnibus Bill And
    Current Deficits, The Deficit Will Be Above \$1 Trillion In 2020 And
    The National Debt Will Reach World War II Levels As A Percent Of
    GDP.** According to the Hill, "A new report from the Congressional
    Budget Office this week found that the combination of the bipartisan
    spending bill and the GOP tax cuts would send deficits skyrocketing
    past \$1 trillion by 2020 and increase the national debt burden to
    its highest level since World War II by the end of a decade. By
    2025, interest on the debt alone is projected to cost more than
    defense or nondefense discretionary spending." \[The Hill,
    [4/12/18](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/382915-bid-to-amend-constitution-falls-short-in-the-house)\]

-   **Requiring A Balanced Budget Would Be Especially Harmful During A
    Recession When Spending Automatically Goes Up, Leading To Either
    Less Fiscal Help Or Higher Taxes, Either Of Which Would Only Makes
    The Recession Worse.** According to the Center for American
    Progress, "And cuts would be even more drastic if the economy falls
    into a recession. Federal government revenues can be volatile during
    economic downturns. For example, in less than a year following the
    collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the federal
    government's projected revenue for FY 2009 dropped by 15
    percent---and this is not even counting the effect of tax cuts
    Congress passed in response to the economic crisis. If that kind of
    scenario repeats itself, Social Security benefits and other
    government spending would have to be cut by 35 percent, if done
    across the board. That would be devastating for those who rely on
    Social Security and other government programs and, as discussed
    below, potentially catastrophic for the economy." \[Center for
    American Progress,
    [4/11/18](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2018/04/11/449429/balanced-budget-amendment-threatens-americans-health-care-social-security-jobs/)\]

-   **Medicaid, Social Security, Medicare And All Other Government
    Programs Are At Risk Of Cuts Under A Required Balanced Budget.**
    According to the Center for American Progress, "No program would be
    protected from these severe cuts, including bulwarks such as Social
    Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Under the proposed amendment,
    Social Security and Medicare would not even be able to draw down
    their own trust funds to maintain benefits if the government, as a
    whole, were running a deficit." \[Center for American Progress,
    [4/11/18](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2018/04/11/449429/balanced-budget-amendment-threatens-americans-health-care-social-security-jobs/)\]

### Congressional Approval Of Major Federal Rules

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted For A GOP Debt Limit Package, Which Would
Require Congressional Approval For All "Major" Federal Rules That Would
Have An Annual Fiscal Impact Of At Least \$100 Million, Cause Price
Increases, Or Cause Adverse Effects To Economic Competitiveness.** In
April 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for
the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023, which would "also establish a process
to require congressional approval of all 'major' federal rules that
would have an annual impact of at least \$100 million, cause a major
increase in prices, or cause significant adverse effects to economic
competitiveness." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by
a vote of 217 to 215, thus the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote

### Discretionary Spending Caps

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Fiscal Responsibility Act Of 2023,
Which Set Discretionary Spending Caps For FY 2024 And FY 2025.** In May
2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the
Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which would, in part, "set
discretionary spending caps for the next two years and include a range
of provisions to limit federal spending, rescind unobligated funds and
streamline environmental permitting processes. The bill would set base
discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense spending for
fiscal years 2024 and 2025, capping defense spending for fiscal 2024 at
\$886.4 billion \-- an increase of approximately 3 percent \-- and
nondefense spending at \$703.7 billion \-- a cut of more than 5 percent.
Both caps would increase for fiscal 2025 by 1 percent. Through fiscal
2025, it would also include specific annual cap adjustments for
specified programs; provide \$44.8 for the veterans\' toxic exposure
fund established by the PACT Act (PL 117-168); and provide \$22 billion
for a Commerce Department IT modernization and facility improvement
fund. If appropriations legislation for fiscal years 2024 and 2025 is
not enacted by Jan. 1 of each year, the bill would set discretionary
spending limits for funds provided under a continuing resolution at
levels reduced 1 percent from the previous fiscal year. For the
subsequent four years, the bill would set overall discretionary spending
limits for the purpose of congressional budget enforcement, establishing
a cap of \$1.62 trillion in fiscal 2026, increasing 1 percent annually
to \$1.67 trillion in fiscal 2029." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 314 to 117, thus the bill was sent to the
Senate. The Senate passed the bill, sent it to President Biden, and it
was signed into law. \[House Vote 243,

3746](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746/all-actions)\]

-   **The Bipartisan Package Coupled The Debt Limit Relief With
    Discretionary Spending Caps.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "On a bipartisan 314-117 vote, the House endorsed legislation
    negotiated by Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and President Joe
    Biden that would couple debt limit relief with caps on discretionary
    spending that Republicans said would serve as a down payment on
    deficit reduction efforts." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7757767?2)\]

-   **The Bill Rescinded About \$27.7 Billion In Unobligated Funds,
    Primarily From COVID-19 Response, The Public Health And Social
    Services Emergency Fund, Agricultural Department Food Supply Chain
    Activities, Highway Infrastructure Programs, And CDC Virus Tracking
    And Vaccine Development Activities.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The bill would rescind approximately \$27.7 billion in
    unobligated funds, primarily for coronavirus response, including
    \$10.4 billion for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency
    Fund, \$3.2 billion for Agriculture Department food supply chain and
    other activities, \$2.2 billion for highway infrastructure programs,
    and \$1.7 billion for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
    virus tracking and vaccine development activities." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/243?24)\]

-   **The Bill Rescinded \$1.4 Billion From The IRS Provided By The
    Inflation Reduction Act For Tax Enforcement.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "It would also rescind \$1.4 billion for
    IRS enforcement provided by the fiscal 2022 reconciliation package
    (PL 117-169)." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/243?24)\]

-   **The Bill Established An "Administrative Pay-As-You-Go" Requirement
    For Federal Agencies, Requiring Them To Submit An Estimate Of
    Budgetary Effects For Administrative Action Proposals.** According
    to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill would establish an
    'administrative pay-as-you-go' requirement for federal agencies,
    requiring agencies to submit to the Office of Management and Budget
    an estimate of the budgetary effects for any proposed administrative
    action and, if the action would increase direct spending by at least
    \$1 billion over the next 10 years or \$100 million in any one year,
    include a proposal for an action to reduce spending by at least an
    equal amount -- effective through 2024." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/243?24)\]

-   **The Bill Held Domestic Spending Flat And Permitted Defense And
    Veterans Spending To Increase.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The new compromise, which would hold domestic spending
    relatively flat and allow defense and veterans spending to increase,
    would likely save at most \$2.1 trillion, the Congressional Budget
    Office estimated." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7757767?2)\]

-   **According to the Congressional Budget Office, The Bill Would
    Likely Save Up To \$2.1 Trillion.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The new compromise, which would hold domestic spending
    relatively flat and allow defense and veterans spending to increase,
    would likely save at most \$2.1 trillion, the Congressional Budget
    Office estimated." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7757767?2)\]

-   **Far-Right Republicans Opposed The Package Because It Included A
    Fraction Of The Deficit Reduction Proposed By The GOP Debt Limit
    Package.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Hard-line
    conservatives opposed the bill because it contains just a fraction
    of the deficit reduction that would have been required under the
    earlier House GOP debt limit bill." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7757767?2)\]

-   **According to the Congressional Budget Office, Due To The Spending
    Caps And Rescissions Of Spending, The Bill Would Save An Estimated
    \$1.5 Trillion Over 10 Years And Up To \$2.1 Trillion If Congress
    Complies With Additional Caps From FY 2026-2029.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Through a combination of caps on
    discretionary spending, rescissions of mostly pandemic spending and
    other changes, the package would save an estimated \$1.5 trillion
    over a decade, and up to \$2.1 trillion if Congress abides by
    additional caps from fiscal 2026 to fiscal 2029 that are not
    enforceable by a sequester, according to the Congressional Budget
    Office." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7757767?2)\]

-   **In FY 2024, The Statutory Limits Would Increase Defense Spending
    To \$886 Billion And Decrease Non-Defense Spending To \$704 Billion,
    Except Emergency Spending, And Spending Would Only Grow By 1% In FY
    2025.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "In fiscal 2024, the
    statutory caps would raise defense spending to \$886 billion and
    lower nondefense spending to \$704 billion, not including emergency
    spending and other funding outside the caps. Spending would be
    allowed to grow by 1 percent in fiscal 2025." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7757767?2)\]

-   **In FY 2024, The Caps Would Effectively Cut Base Discretionary
    Spending To \$1.59 Trillion From FY 2023's \$1.602 Trillion.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The caps would technically
    cut overall base discretionary spending to \$1.59 trillion in 2024,
    from \$1.602 trillion this year." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7757767?2)\]

-   **The Package Would Automatically Cut Discretionary Spending By 1%
    If Congress Fails To Pass All 12 Budget Bills For FY 2024 By January
    1, 2024.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Another key
    provision in the bill --- championed by Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky.
    --- would automatically cut discretionary spending by 1 percent if
    Congress does not pass all 12 appropriations bills for fiscal 2024
    by Jan. 1, 2024. That was a key selling point for Massie, typically
    a staunch fiscal conservative, to support the debt limit measure, as
    well as other outspoken conservatives like Rep. Marjorie Taylor
    Greene, R-Ga." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7757767?2)\]

-   **The Package Would Trigger Automatic Cuts To Discretionary Spending
    If Congress Were To Fail To Appropriate Below The Caps In FY 2024
    And FY 2025.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill would
    provide for automatic cuts to discretionary spending if Congress
    does not appropriate below the limits in fiscal 2024 and fiscal
    2025." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/31/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7757767?2)\]

-   **The Package Would Provide Spending Caps From FY 2026 Through FY
    2029 But Enforced Only Budget Rules, Which Could Be Waived By
    Majority Votes.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Spending
    caps continue from 2026 to 2029 but they are enforced only by budget
    rules, which lawmakers could waive by majority vote."

### Limiting Spending

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted For A GOP Debt Limit Package, Which Would
Limit Federal Spending By Setting Base Discretionary Spending Limits
Through FY 2033, Capping Spending For FY 2024 At FY 2022 Levels, And
Increasing The Cap By 1% Annually.** In April 2023, according to
Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Limit, Save, Grow Act
of 2023, which would "also include a range of provisions to limit
federal spending, as well as the text of a previously passed energy and
permitting policy package. The bill would set base discretionary
spending limits through fiscal 2033, capping spending for fiscal 2024 at
the fiscal 2022 level of \$1.47 trillion --- a reduction from current
spending levels --- and raising the cap by 1 percent annually through
fiscal 2033. It would also include similar annual cap adjustments for
specified programs, including for wildfire suppression, disability
reviews and redeterminations, health care fraud and abuse control, and
disaster reemployment services and eligibility assessments." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 217 to 215, thus
the bill was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 199,

-   **The Bill Would Rescind Unobligated Funds Provided By The Inflation
    Reduction Act For COVID-19 Relief, IRS Enforcement And Climate And
    Infrastructure Initiatives And Would Rescind Unobligated Funding
    From The American Rescue Plan And Other Coronavirus Response Laws.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill would rescind
    unobligated amounts from various funds provided by the fiscal 2022
    reconciliation package (PL 117-169) for COVID-19 relief, IRS
    enforcement, and certain climate- and infrastructure-focused
    initiatives, as well as all unobligated funding from the March 2021
    coronavirus relief reconciliation package (PL 117-2) and earlier
    coronavirus response laws." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [4/26/23](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2023/H/199?5)\]

-   **The Bill Sought To Cut \$131 Billion From Discretionary Spending
    In FY 2024.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The GOP debt
    limit bill laid the groundwork for a fierce partisan clash over
    appropriations levels for the coming fiscal year. House
    Appropriations Chair Kay Granger, R-Texas, said the debt limit bill,
    which called for cutting \$131 billion from discretionary spending
    in fiscal 2024, will be the 'framework' she uses to begin marking up
    appropriations bills. But the panel's ranking Democrat, Connecticut
    Rep. Rosa DeLauro, promised a fight." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [4/27/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-7726426?2)\]

-   **Veterans Advocacy Groups Were Concerned That The Bill Did Not
    Provide Protections For Veterans Spending.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Meanwhile, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans
    of America and 23 other groups that advocate for veterans sent a
    letter to lawmakers Tuesday expressing 'grave concerns' about the
    Republicans' debt limit bill, urging Congress not to pass the
    legislation unless it carves out protections for veterans spending."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [4/27/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-7726426?2)\]

-   **The Bill Would Cap Discretionary Spending At The FY 2022 Level Of
    \$1.47 Trillion For A Decade And Allow For 1% Annual Growth.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill caps discretionary
    spending at the fiscal 2022 level of \$1.47 trillion for a decade,
    allowing for 1 percent annual growth." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [4/27/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-7726426?2)\]

-   **Although The Bill Rescinded Unspent Funds From The Inflation
    Reduction Act, The Restoration Of Biofuel Tax Incentives Were
    Estimated To Cost Almost \$39 Billion, So The Bill's Total Savings
    Would Be Around \$4.8 Trillion Over 11 Years.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Rescissions of unspent funds appropriated
    in last year's climate reconciliation package (PL 117-169) would
    trim nearly \$10 billion in spending, while restoring several
    biofuels tax incentives would cost almost \$39 billion. The
    measure's total savings still round up to \$4.8 trillion over 11
    years as originally projected." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [4/27/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-7726426?2)\]

-   **The Congressional Budget Office Estimated That The GOP Debt Limit
    Package Would Generate About \$29 Billion Less In Net Deficit
    Reduction.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday the GOP debt limit
    measure would generate about \$29 billion less in net deficit
    reduction than previously estimated after a series of late changes
    tucked into the bill to win over holdouts." \[Congressional
