# FY 2025

**2025: Fitzpatrick Voted For The FY 2025 Budget Framework That Included
\$2 Trillion In Cuts, Raised The Statutory Debt Limit By \$4 Trillion,
And Required House Committees To Recommend Legislation That Would
Implement Trump's Agenda.** In February 2025, Fitzpatrick voted for ,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "the concurrent resolution that
would recommend a budget for fiscal 2025 and budget levels through
fiscal 2034. The resolution would assume minimum savings of \$1.5
trillion over 10 years and 2.6 percent economic growth over the same
period. It also would require the statutory debt limit to be raised by
\$4 trillion. It also would authorize the House Ways and Means Committee
to increase deficits by \$4.5 trillion over 10 years to extend the 2017
tax cuts and implement new tax cuts proposed by the White House. It also
would provide instructions for the budget reconciliation process through
which separate legislation could be considered and passed in the Senate
via a simple majority vote. The measure would deliver instructions to 11
House committees to report legislation that would implement President
Donald Trump's agenda, such as expanding tax cuts and bolstering border
security and immigration enforcement. The committees would be required
to report their legislative recommendations to the House Budget
Committee by March 27, 2025. It also would set a \$2 trillion target for
the spending cuts to be submitted to the House Budget Committee. The
resolution also would stipulate that if the committees don\'t reach that
target, the Ways and Means' reconciliation instructions to increase the
deficit by a maximum of \$4.5 trillion would be decreased by the amount
the other committees come in below the target. Similarly, it would
stipulate that Ways and Means could increase the deficit above the \$4.5
trillion level by the amount of savings the committees achieve above the
\$2 trillion target." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
resolution by a vote of 217 to 215. \[House Vote 50,

-   **The Resolution Was A First Step In The Reconciliation Process As
    The Senate, Which Sought A Slimmer Resolution, Would Need To Adopt
    The Same Resolution For The Process To Move Forward.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "And the plan remains at odds with that of
    Senate Republicans, who are pursuing their own slimmer budget
    blueprint (S Con Res 7) focused on border security and defense,
    while deferring tax legislation until later in the year. Both
    chambers would need to adopt the same budget resolution before
    taking up a reconciliation bill containing all the specific spending
    cuts, tax cuts and other measures." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/25/25](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8182831?17)\]

-   **Moderate Republicans Originally Concerned With The Potential For
    Medicaid Cuts Were Assured The \$880 Billion In Cuts From The Energy
    And Commerce Committee Would Target Medicaid Fraud.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Party moderates, meanwhile, earlier
    expressed concern about the impact spending cuts could have on
    Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income families. The
    budget would instruct the Energy and Commerce Committee to find
    \$880 billion in savings over a decade, and Medicaid is the ripest
    target for cuts in that panel\'s jurisdiction. Cuts to food stamp
    benefits in the Agriculture panel\'s jurisdiction were another
    sticking point. But they won reassurances from House leaders after a
    late-night meeting Monday that included Majority Leader Steve
    Scalise, R-La., and Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie,
    R-Ky., Johnson said Tuesday, that cost-cutting would focus on
    Medicaid fraud, while not touching benefits for those eligible for
    the program." \[Congressional Quarterly,

### Continuing Appropriations

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted For A Continuing Resolution That Included
Funding At An Annualized Rate Of The Last Enacted Appropriations And
Temporarily Suspended The Federal Debt Ceiling Through 2027.** In
December 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional
Quarterly, "the bill that would provide funding for federal government
operations through March 14, 2025 at an annualized rate equal to enacted
fiscal 2024 appropriations. The bill would provide \$110 billion in
disaster aid, including \$29 billion for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's disaster relief fund, \$300 million for fishery
resource disaster aid, \$30.8 billion for crop and livestock losses and
\$8 billion for road and bridge repair. It would temporarily suspend,
through January 30, 2027 the federal debt limit. It would provide funds
for the District of Columbia to prepare for the presidential
inauguration. It would allow the Department of Justice to spend at a
rate as fast as needed for salaries and expenses in the FBI. It also
would allow the Navy to spend nearly \$9 billion of its regular annual
appropriation upfront for procurement of Columbia-class submarines,
while appropriating an extra \$5.7 billion for Virginia-class
submarines. Additionally, it would provide up to \$625 million for the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to maintain its
next-generation weather satellite acquisition schedule. The measure also
would create a 100 percent federal cost share for reconstruction of the
Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Md. The measure also would
provide a three-month extension for several public health programs
including the National Health Services Corps and the Special Diabetes
programs and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education
program." The House rejected the bill by a vote of 174 to 235. \[House

### Continuing Resolution

**2025: Fitzpatrick Voted For The FY 2025 Continuing Resolution That Cut
Nondefense Spending By \$13 Billion While Increasing Defense Spending By
\$6 Billion And Extended Certain Health Programs Through September
30th.** In March 2025, Fitzpatrick voted for. , according to
Congressional Quarterly, "the bill that would extend government funding
through the end of fiscal year 2025 (Sept. 30). The measure would retain
most programs and activities at fiscal year 2024 funding levels, but
would make cuts to certain domestic and foreign assistance programs. The
continuing resolution would reduce nondefense funding by approximately
\$13 billion, while increasing defense spending by \$6 billion, making
for a net decrease of \$7 billion in discretionary spending. The bill
also would include an extension of several health care programs through
Sept. 30 including funding for community health centers, graduate
medical education programs, and the special diabetes programs. It also
would extend add-on payments for low-volume hospitals and Medicare
add-on payments for rural ambulance services and extend telehealth
flexibilities for hospitals to treat patients in their own homes." The
vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 217 to 213.

-   **Some Republicans Initially Opposed The Bill Arguing It Didn't Cut
    Spending Enough But Ultimately Voted For The Bill After Lobbying By
    Vice President Vance, Who Promised A Rescissions Package.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Some wavering House
    Republicans had complained the bill wouldn\'t do enough to cut
    spending and would effectively extend the funding levels set during
    the Biden administration, while giving more money to the Pentagon.
    But they ultimately voted in favor of the bill after a closing pitch
    Tuesday morning by Vance, who told Republicans in their conference
    meeting that the administration would submit a rescissions package
    to claw back spending deemed wasteful by Elon Musk\'s Department of
    Government Efficiency, or DOGE." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/12/25](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-8195478?11)\]

-   **Democrats Called The Resolution A "Blank Check" For The Trump
    Administration.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "House
    Democrats denounced the CR as a 'blank check' and a 'power grab' by
    the Trump administration to spend money however it wishes. They have
    sought a provision to protect the congressional \"power of the
    purse\" as Trump and DOGE fire thousands of federal workers, freeze
    funding for some programs and gut agencies like the U.S. Agency for
    International Development." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/12/25](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-8195478?11)\]

-   **The Resolution Omitted A Provision That Would Have Allowed D.C. To
    Operate Under Its Most Recently Approved Budget And Exempt The City
    From A Potential Government Shutdown In October.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "After the vote, House Appropriations
    ranking member Rosa DeLauro tried to get unanimous consent to adopt
    an engrossment correction --- changes to the bill text in the
    version that's officially sent to the Senate. The resolution would
    add \[...\] language omitted from the stopgap bill that would allow
    Washington, D.C., to operate under its most recently approved budget
    and exempt it from a potential government shutdown starting next
    October. Del. Eleanor Homes Norton, D-D.C., railed against the
    provisions' omission in floor remarks Tuesday, echoing comments from
    D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser on Monday that it could cost the city
    government over \$1 billion in revenue for the remainder of the
    fiscal year." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/12/25](https://plus.cq.com/doc/btnews-8195478?11)\]

-   **The Bill Held The Topline Below What Was Agreed To In The 2023
    Debt agreement And Reduced Nondefense Spending Through Cuts To
    Earmarked Line-Item Projects In FY 2024 Funding.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The bill would boost defense spending over
    the previous year\'s level, while holding the topline below the
    fiscal 2025 ceiling agreed to as part of the 2023 debt limit
    agreement. Meanwhile nondefense spending would take a significant
    hit on paper, though that\'s mostly achieved through cutting funds
    that had been earmarked for line-item member projects in the fiscal
    2024 spending packages (PL 118-42, PL 118-47)." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [3/11/25](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8195447?12)\]

-   **Total Funding Under The Bill Was \$1.658 Trillion With A .7
    Percent Increase In Defense Spending And 1.7 Percent Reduction In
    Nondefense Spending.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "House
    Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., said total discretionary
    funding under the long-term stopgap measure is \$1.658 trillion. The
    Congressional Budget Office pegged the defense category at \$892.5
    billion, a \$6.2 billion or 0.7 percent increase, leaving roughly
    \$765.5 billion for nondefense programs, a \$13 billion or 1.7
    percent reduction." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/11/25](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8195447?12)\]

-   **Leadership Removed A Provision That Increased The Quantity Of
    Special Immigrant Visas For Afghans To Convince GOP Holdouts To Vote
    For The Bill.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "House leaders
    made a significant concession Monday night by tucking into the bill
    a manager\'s amendment to remove a provision that would have
    increased the number of Special Immigrant Visas available to
    Afghans. Supporters of the provision have said Afghans who helped
    the U.S. fight the Taliban deserve protection, but critics have
    questioned whether Afghans are carefully vetted before being allowed
    to immigrate." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/11/25](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8195447?12)\]

-   **Hakeem Jeffries Claimed The Bill Granted Trump Too Much Authority
    And Was An "Attack" On Veterans, Families, And Seniors.** According
    to Congressional Quarterly, "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries,
    D-N.Y., attacked the measure as a 'partisan, reckless spending bill'
    that gives Trump too much authority and amounts to 'an attack on
    veterans, an attack on families, an attack on seniors.'"
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/11/25](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8195447?12)\]

-   **The Bill Included A Blanket Provision That Allowed For New
    Pentagon Programs, Granting The Pentagon General Transfer Authority
    Of \$8 Billion.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    Pentagon, in particular, has never operated under a full-year
    continuing resolution and has long resisted such an outcome, saying
    it would hamstring the ability to respond to new threats. The CR
    tries to address that concern by including a blanket provision
    allowing for the start of new programs, but it\'s not clear how many
    new programs could be funded. The measure would give the Pentagon
    general transfer authority of \$8 billion, so defense officials
    could rearrange their fiscal priorities up to that level before
    requiring new congressional approval." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/11/25](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8195447?12)\]

### House Budget Resolution

**2025: Fitzpatrick Voted To Concur In The Senate Amendment To The FY
2025 House Budget Resolution.** In April 2025, Fitzpatrick voted for ,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "motion to concur in the Senate
amendment to the fiscal 2025 budget resolution that would recommend a
budget for fiscal 2025 and budget levels through fiscal 2034. The
resolution would set a goal to reduce mandatory spending by \$2
trillion. It also would include reconciliation instructions to increase
the deficit for the House Armed Services Committee by \$100 billion, the
Homeland Security Committee by \$90 billion and the Judiciary Committee
by \$110 billion over the 10-year period. Senate instructions would
direct the Senate Armed Services Committee to increase the deficit by
\$150 billion, the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee by
\$20 billion, the Environment and Public Works Committee by \$1 billion,
and the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee and the
Judiciary Committee by a total of \$175 billion each over the 10-year
period. It also would require the House Ways and Means Committee to
raise the statutory debt by \$4 trillion. It would authorize the
committee to increase deficits by \$4.5 trillion over 10 years to extend
the 2017 tax cuts and implement new tax cuts proposed by the White
House. In comparison, the Senate Finance Committee would be required to
raise the statutory debt limit by up to \$5 trillion and would be
authorized to increase deficits by \$1.5 trillion. The measure would
deliver instructions to 11 House committees to report legislation that
would comport with the spending guidance for their jurisdiction.
Similarly, the measure would deliver instructions to 10 Senate
committees to report legislation that would comport with the spending
guidance for their jurisdiction. All committees would be required to
report their legislative recommendations to the House and Senate Budget
committees by May 9, 2025. The measure also would set a \$2 trillion
target for the spending cuts to be submitted to the House Budget
Committee. It would stipulate that if the committees don\'t reach that
target, the Ways and Means Committee's reconciliation instructions to
increase the deficit by a maximum of \$4.5 trillion would be decreased
by the amount the other committees come in below the target. Similarly,
it would stipulate that Ways and Means could increase the deficit above
the \$4.5 trillion level by the amount of savings the committees achieve
above the \$2 trillion target." The vote was on the motion to concur.
The House concurred by a vote of 216 to 214. \[House Vote 100,

-   **The Senate Version Called For Fewer Spending Cuts, Larger, Tax
    Cuts, And A Bigger Debt Limit Increase Than The House Version.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "It\'s no sure thing at this
    point the House GOP will be able to adopt the Senate\'s revisions,
    which would allow for smaller spending cuts and larger tax cuts,
    paired with a bigger debt limit increase, than the House\'s budget
    framework." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [4/5/25](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-8215684?17)\]

-   **The Senate Version Included Over \$5 Trillion In Tax Cuts Compared
    To \$4.5 Trillion In The House Version.** According to NPR, "All
    together the Senate plan would allow for more than \$5 trillion in
    tax cuts. The blueprint would extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
    passed in 2017 under Trump\'s first term. The program is set to
    expire by year end, which would mean a tax hike for millions of
    Americans. The bill also provides for an additional \$1.5 trillion
    in new tax cuts. Republicans are hoping the new cuts can make good
    on several of Trump\'s promises from the campaign, like no taxes on
    tips. The House, by comparison, has passed a budget framework that
    sets aside \$4.5 trillion for tax cuts." \[NPR,
    [4/5/25](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/05/g-s1-58281/senate-budget-resolution-reconciliation-trump)\]

-   **The Senate Version Required \$4 Billion Spending Cuts Compared To
    The \$1.5 Trillion, Including \$880 Billion Targeted At Medicaid,
    Required By The House Version.** According to NPR, "One of the
    biggest differences between the Senate plan and the House plan is
    how to pay for tax cuts. The bill directs both chambers to cut the
    deficit through spending cuts. While the Senate spending cuts are
    set at just around \$4 billion, the House intends to cut at least
    \$1.5 trillion. That includes a directive to the House Energy and
    Commerce Committee to cut \$880 billion in spending, which has
    raised fear that those cuts can\'t happen without a significant hit
    to Medicaid benefits." \[NPR,
    [4/5/25](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/05/g-s1-58281/senate-budget-resolution-reconciliation-trump)\]

-   **Senate Republicans Planned To Use A "Procedural Gimmick" To Make
    The \$3.8 Trillion Required To Expand Trump's Tax Cuts Effectively
    Cost Nothing.** According to NPR, "Senate Republicans are also
    hoping to use a procedural gimmick that would effectively work to
    make the \$3.8 trillion it would take to extend the Trump tax cuts
    appear to cost nothing. It\'s a risky approach that is already
    causing tension between Republicans in the Senate and their House
    counterparts --- and could prove one of the biggest obstacles to
    final passage." \[NPR,
    [4/5/25](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/05/g-s1-58281/senate-budget-resolution-reconciliation-trump)\]

-   **The Senate Version Included An Additional \$521 Billion For GOP
    Policy Priorities.** According to NPR, "The Senate plan also calls
    for an additional \$521 billion in spending for a range of GOP
    policy priorities. There as much as \$175 billion that\'s expected
    to be used for border enforcement, plus \$150 billion for defense
    spending." \[NPR,
    [4/5/25](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/05/g-s1-58281/senate-budget-resolution-reconciliation-trump)\]

-   **The Senate Version Called For \$150 Billion In Defense Spending
    Compared To The \$100 Billion In The House Version.** According to
    the Hill, "Another major sticking point between Senate and House
    Republicans is how much to increase defense spending in the
    reconciliation bill. The Senate budget calls for \$150 billion in
    direct defense spending while the House budget called for \$100
    billion in additional defense spending. Graham, the Senate budget
    chairman, kept the conflicting instructions to the Senate and House
    Armed Services Committees to postpone a fight between the chambers
    on the issue until later in the year." \[Hill,
    [4/5/25](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5233787-senate-republicans-vote-budget-resolution/)\]

-   **The Senate Version Capped The Deficit Increase At \$1.5 Trillion
    While The House Version Capped The Deficit Increase At \$4.5
    Trillion, Resulting In Opposition From House Republicans Who Claim
    The Senate Cap Is Too Low To Enact Trump's Tax Priorities.**
    According to the Hill, "House Republicans included language in their
    budget instructing the Ways and Means panel to submit changes in
    laws that increase the deficit by not more than \$4.5 trillion. The
    Senate budget kept the House's instruction but also included a
    separate instruction to the Senate Finance Committee to report
    changes in laws that increase the deficit by not more than \$1.5
    trillion. One Republican senator said the Senate language has
    prompted grumbling among House Republicans that the instruction to
    the Senate Finance Committee sets too low of a deficit cap to
    accommodate all of Trump's tax priorities, such as exempting tipped
    wages and Social Security benefits from taxation." \[Hill,
    [4/5/25](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5233787-senate-republicans-vote-budget-resolution/)\]

### Military Construction-VA

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted For The FY 2025 Military Construction-Veterans
Affairs Appropriations That Included A Total Of \$380.3 Billion.** In
June 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to Congressional Quarterly,
"the bill, as amended, that would provide \$380.3 billion in fiscal 2025
for military construction programs and the Veterans Affairs Department,
a nearly 10 percent increase from the enacted fiscal 2024 level. The
bill would allocate \$147.5 billion in discretionary funding, including
more than \$129 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, a \$6
billion decrease from the fiscal 2024 enacted level. It would provide
\$112.6 billion for veterans\' medical care programs. It also contains
\$495 million for veterans\' memorial benefits at the National Cemetery
Administration. It would allocate nearly \$18 billion for military
construction programs. It also would allocate \$1.1 billion for 11
barracks projects, with another \$2 billion designated for military
family housing projects. It would include \$547 million in community
project funding, for 23 military construction projects." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 209 to 197. \[House Vote

    Orders Regarding DEI And Racial Equity In The Federal Workforce, And
    The Implementation Of Executive Orders Related To Decarbonization
    And Climate Change.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "It also

    at a VA facility or national cemetery other than the U.S. flag, the
    flag of a state, territory, the District of Columbia, a Native
    American tribe or an armed force\'s flag. It also would prohibit
    funding for gender-affirming surgical procedures or hormone
    therapies and abortion-related care or counseling. The bill would
    prohibit the use of funds to enforce three Biden administration
    executive orders dealing with diversity, equity and inclusion in the
    federal workforce and advancing racial equity through the federal
    government. It also would bar the use of funding to carry out

    Life Of The Veteran Would Be Endangered If The Pregnancy Went To
    Term Or If The Pregnancy Resulted From Rape Or Incest.** "The White
    House also opposed provisions that would limit the VA's ability to

    from reporting people receiving benefits who are deemed mentally

    Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee criticized the bill
    for reducing the amount dedicated to military construction from last
    year\'s level by \$718 million, and for not doing enough to address
    climate change\'s impacts on military installations. Instead, they
