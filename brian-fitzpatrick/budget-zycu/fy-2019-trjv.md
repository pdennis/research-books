# FY 2019

### Minibus And September Continuing Resolution

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For An FY 2019 Defense, Labor, HHS, Education
Conference Report Appropriations Bill Which Also Included A Continuing
Resolution For The Other Federal Spending Bills Through December 7,
2018.** In September 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for an FY 2019
appropriations bill and continuing resolution. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "The agreement provides FY 2019 appropriations
for two annual spending measures --- Defense and Labor-HHS-Education ---
as well as a continuing resolution to keep all federal departments and
agencies operating through Dec. 7 if they don\'t have full-year
appropriations enacted. Together, the two spending bills provide a total
of \$784.5 billion in discretionary spending subject to budget caps, 63%
of the \$1.244 trillion limit for FY 2019. It provides \$674.4 billion
in net discretionary funding for the Defense Department (\$19.8 billion
more than FY 2018 but \$1.1 billion less than requested), including
\$606.5 billion in base discretionary funding (\$17.0 billion more than
FY 2018) and \$67.9 billion in OCO funding. For Labor-HHS-Education it
provides \$180 billion in discretionary spending, including \$178.1
billion subject to budget caps and \$1.9 billion in program integrity
funding --- \$977 million more than comparable FY 2018 funding and
\$10.7 billion more than requested." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 361 to 61. The president later signed the
bill into law. \[House Vote 405,

### Shutdown

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For An Omnibus Spending Proposal Preventing
Another Government Shutdown.** In February 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for
the FY 2019 consolidated appropriations bill. According to Congressional
Quarterly, "This Conference Summary describes the agreement on H J Res
31, Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY 2019, which provides
detailed, full-year funding for all seven remaining FY 2019 spending
bills ---thereby completing the FY 2019 appropriations process. The
centerpiece, Homeland Security, provides \$1.375 billion for new and
replacement barriers along the U.S. border with Mexico, including 55
miles of new fencing, along with an increase of \$1.5 billion in other
border security funding --- such as for new technology at ports of entry
and additional Customs officers. Outside of the Homeland bill, it
includes another \$1.6 billion for border security, as well as a 1.9%
pay increase for federal civilian employees." The vote was on passage.
The House passed the bill by a vote of 300 to 128. The bill was later
signed into law by the president. \[House Vote 87,

-   **The Government Had Been Shutdown For Weeks Over Border Wall
    Funding; This Bill Prevented Another.** According to Politico,
    "Three weeks after the longest shutdown in U.S. history, the House
    and Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation to fund roughly
    one-quarter of the federal government through Sept. 30, while
    providing only a fraction of the funds for a border barrier that
    Trump demanded." \[Politico,
    [2/14/19](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/14/spending-bill-vote-government-shutdown-1170006)\]

-   **President Trump Demanded \$5.7 Billion For Wall Funding, But The
    Bill Only Provided \$1.375 Billion For New And Replacement
    Barriers.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The centerpiece,
    Homeland Security, provides \$1.375 billion for new and replacement
    barriers along the U.S. border with Mexico, including 55 miles of
    new fencing, along with an increase of \$1.5 billion in other border
    security funding --- such as for new technology at ports of entry
    and additional Customs officers. Outside of the Homeland bill, it
    includes another \$1.6 billion for border security, as well as a
    1.9% pay increase for federal civilian employees. President Trump,
    who wanted \$5.7 billion for 234 miles of new border 'wall,' has not
    yet decided whether he will sign the agreement, according to White
    House staff." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [2/14/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5463527?7)\]

-   **After Signing The Bill, Trump Signed An Emergency Declaration
    Bypassing Congress To Fund The Wall.** According to the Washington
    Post, "President Trump on Friday declared the situation on the
    southern border of the United States to be a national emergency,
    catapulting the country into uncertain legal and political battles
    as he seeks to fulfill a campaign promise that eluded him for two
    years. He made the designation in an attempt to redirect taxpayer
    money from other accounts and use it to erect more than 230 miles of
    barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. But Trump anticipates a
    flurry of legal challenges that will eventually be decided by the
    Supreme Court." \[Washington Post,

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted To Express The Sense Of The House That
Government Shutdowns Cause Substantial Damage To Federal Employees,
Americans Overall, The U.S. Economy, And That Shutting The Government
Shutdown Is An Unacceptable Strategy.** In January 2019, Fitzpatrick
voted for a resolution that, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"express\[ed\] the sense of the House of Representatives that government
shutdowns cause substantial damage to federal employees, to Americans
generally who benefit from government services, to the U.S. economy and
to the nation's reputation and state that shutting down the U.S.
government 'is not an acceptable tactic or strategy' for resolving
policy differences." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and
pass the bill, which required 275 votes in this case to pass. The House
rejected the motion by a vote of 249 to 163. \[House Vote 65,

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For A CR That Would Have Extended DHS Funding
Through The End Of February, 2019, Thus Re-Opening DHS; Bill Did Not
Provide Funding For Trump's Wall.** In January 2019, Fitzpatrick voted
for legislation that would have, according to The Hill, "The House on
Thursday passed a Democratic-backed bill to provide funding for the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through Feb. 28. The bill passed
in a 231-180 vote, with five Republicans joining Democrats in voting for
the measure. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) was the lone Democrat
to vote against it. The bill is not expected to see any movement in the
upper chamber. The legislation --- introduced by House Homeland Security
Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman-designate Lucille Roybal-Allard
(D-Calif.) --- would provide no new funding for President Trump's
proposed border wall. Democrats have brought up a series of clean
funding bills in an attempt to place pressure on GOP lawmakers to break
with the administration in their demand for funding for a barrier along
the U.S.-Mexico border." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 231 to 180. \[House Vote 51,

In January 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "provide\[d\] \$271.8 billion for full-year
fiscal 2019 funding for six of the seven spending bills that reached a
conference agreement, but that lack enacted appropriations (all except

several expiring programs including the National Flood Insurance Program
and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families." The vote was on a
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 234 to 180. \[House Vote

-   **The Stopgap Bill Funded The Federal Government For Three Weeks
    Without The Border Wall Funding That President Trump Was Demanding
    And Provided Temporary Relief To Federal Workers Who Had Not Been
    Paid During The 35-Day Government Shutdown.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "President Donald Trump signed a stopgap
    spending bill without money he had demanded for a border wall Friday
    night, setting the stage to reopen government agencies that have
    been closed for 35 days. The continuing resolution (H J Res 28)
    would fund the government for three weeks while a House-Senate
    conference committee negotiates a border security package with the
    White House. It provides at least a temporary reprieve to federal
    workers who haven't been paid in nearly a month." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [1/25/19](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-5450459?1)\]

-   **The Final Version Of The Stopgap Bill Funded The Government
    Through February 15, 2019.** According to Congressional Quarterly,

provides \$12.1 billion in supplemental disaster funds for response
efforts to damage caused by hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes and other
natural disasters that occurred in 2017 and 2018. The bill includes a
total of \$2.7 billion for Agriculture Department disaster-related
activities, including \$1.1 billion for crop (including milk), tree,
bush, vine, and livestock losses from 2018 hurricanes, wildfires and
other declared disasters. The bill provides \$1.16 billion for the
Housing and Urban Development Department's Community Development Block
Grants-Disaster Recovery Program, and \$1.7 billion for Transportation
Department programs and activities, including \$1.65 billion for the
cost of federal highway and bridge repairs. It provides \$1.46 billion
to the Defense Department to repair military facilities damaged by
hurricanes Florence and Michael, primarily for repairing damage to
military facilities in the Carolinas and Florida. As amended, the bill
would prohibit funds provided in the bill for the Army Corps of
Engineers or the Homeland Security Department from being used to
construct a 'new physical barrier' along the southwest border of the
U.S. Also as amended, the bill would permit the use of emergency funds
provided to the Agriculture Department for 2018 crop losses to be used

smoke from wildfires." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 237 to 187. \[House Vote 39,

    Study Diverting Army Corps Of Engineer Funding To Fund It.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "As the partial government
    shutdown enters its third week with little signs of progress,
    President Donald Trump has begun to float a new idea for building
    his border wall: declaring a national emergency. He could probably
    do it. \[...\] The White House has also reportedly directed the Army
    Corps of Engineers to take a look at its budget for potential funds

    Reported Significant Impacts At The National Parks.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "For the Interior Department, 76% of its
    staff has been furloughed, which according to news reports has
    resulted in many national parks being left ungated and largely
    unsupervised, and museums and zoos closed --- including the National
    Gallery of Art, all 19 Smithsonian museums, and the National Zoo.
    And while the gates at many park sites remain open, few if any staff
    are on hand to protect visitors and park resources and many visitor
    centers and restrooms remained locked, while many roads closed due

    people in this world: Those who take it upon themselves to go to
    understaffed national parks to keep them clean during the government
    shutdown, and then those who set up illegal campsites and cut down
    Joshua trees in the national park of the same name. Pictures shared

    Congressional Quarterly, "The measure provides \$3.2 billion for the
    National Park Service --- \$16 million (0.5%) more than FY 2018 and
    \$517 million (19%) more than the request. The vast majority, \$2.5
    billion, is for operation and maintenance of national parks, \$22
    million (1%) more than FY 2018 and \$75 million (3%) more than
    requested. Included in that amount is \$825 million for facility
    operations and maintenance (\$15 million more than FY 2018 and \$43

    soon occur on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP,
    or food stamps) if the government fails to reopen by February.
    Although SNAP is automatically renewed, it requires annual funding
    through appropriations bills, and existing funding will run out at
    the end of January. And even if SNAP contingency funding remains
    available, that amount would cover less than two-thirds of the
    program's cost in February. In addition, individuals seeking to
    newly register for SNAP are seeing delays in accessing those
    benefits because 95% of the office that administers the program has
    been furloughed, and local grocery stores where SNAP benefits are

-   **Legislation Provides \$8 Billion In Overall Farm Loans, About
    \$400 Million More Than Requested.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The Farm Service Agency, using the Agricultural Credit
    Insurance Fund, offers a variety of loans to farmers, including
    farm-operating, farm ownership, American Indian tribal land
    acquisition and boll weevil eradication loans. The bill provides for

    overall loan level of \$8.0 billion, \$400 million (5%) more than
    requested. The vast majority (44%) of the overall loan level for FY
    2019 would go toward farm-operating loans, which help farmers pay
    for essential expenses such as the purchase of livestock, equipment
    and seed, and farm ownership loans that help farmers acquire,
    enlarge or develop their lands. Specifically, the measure sets a
    total loan level of \$3.5 billion for farm-operating loans,
    including \$2.0 billion in unsubsidized guaranteed loans (equal to
    FY 2018 but \$360 million more than requested) and \$1.5 billion in
    direct loans (equal to FY 2018 but \$30 million more than
    requested). For farm ownership loans, the loan level is set at \$4.3
    billion, including \$2.8 billion in guaranteed loans (equal to both
    FY 2018 and the request) and \$1.5 billion in direct loans (equal to

    that help private landowners reduce erosion, improve soil and water
    quality and quantity, improve and conserve wetlands, and enhance
    fish and wildlife habitat. Most of these programs receive mandatory
    funding through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). The measure
    provides \$879.1 million for operating and administering the Natural
    Resources Conservation Service\'s (NRCS) conservation programs,
    according to Democratic appropriators --- \$5 million more than FY
    2018 and \$210 million more than requested. It rejects
    administration proposals to end funding for the watershed flood and
    prevention programs, appropriating \$150 million (equal to FY 2018).

    watershed rehabilitation program, which received \$10 million in FY
    2018." \[Congressional Quarterly,

    to Congressional Quarterly, "The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation
    is a government-owned entity, managed by the Agriculture
    Department\'s Risk Management Agency, that provides crop insurance
    protection to farmers and other agricultural entities. The measure
    provides 'such sums as may be necessary' for the CCC and to carry
    out the federal crop insurance program. Democratic appropriators did
    not estimate the amounts that the bill would provide for those
    activities. (The bill reported by Senate Appropriations estimated it
    would provide the requested \$15.4 billion for the CCC, 8% more than
    FY 2018, to reimburse the CCC for expenditures incurred in previous
    fiscal years to finance farm price supports, export promotion,
    disposition of surplus commodities and other programs. It also
    estimated the bill would provide \$8.7 billion to carry out the
    federal crop insurance program, 3% less than FY 2018.) The bill
    appropriates \$75 million for the Risk Management Agency to
    administer the federal crop insurance program, equal to FY 2018 but
    nearly double the request." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [1/8/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5441288?6)\]

-   **Legislation Appropriated \$1 Billion For The Animal And Plant
    Health Inspection Services And \$1 Billion For The Food Safety And
    Inspection Service.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) conducts
    inspection and quarantine activities to protect animals and plants
    from diseases and pests. The bill provides \$1.0 billion for APHIS
    operations --- \$18 million more than FY 2018 and \$262 million more
    than requested, according to Democratic appropriators. Within the
    APHIS total, the bill recommends \$333 million for animal health
    activities, \$342 million for plant health, \$127 million for
    wildlife services, \$35 million for regulatory services, \$42
    million for emergency management, \$38 million for safe trade, and
    \$32 million for animal welfare. The bill includes an \$8 million
    increase, to remain available until Sept. 30, 2020, to help states
    and producers address the damaging effects of citrus greening
    disease within the specialty crop pests program, was well as a
    separate \$7.5 million for one-time control and management related
    to the multiple-agency response to citrus greening. It also provides
    \$12 million for the cotton pests program; \$38 million for animal
    health technical services; \$63 million for avian health; \$178
    million for specialty crop pests; and \$60 million for tree and wood
    pests. \[...\] The bill provides \$1.0 billion --- \$8 million less
    than FY 2018 but \$17 million more than requested --- for the Food
    Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which enforces laws requiring
    meat and poultry products to be wholesome, unadulterated and
    properly packaged and labeled. FSIS also inspects egg-processing
    plants and administers a pathogen reduction program. The measure
    requires that FSIS employ at least 148 full-time equivalent
    positions for inspections and enforcement of humane methods of
    slaughter." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [1/8/19](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5441288?6)\]

-   **The Bill Provided \$3 Billion For The FDA.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
    which is in the Health and Human Services Department, regulates
    food, cosmetics, human and animal drugs, and medical devices.
    Funding for the FDA includes both direct appropriations and funding
    from user fees. The bill provides the FDA with a direct
    appropriation of \$3.0 billion and it assumes \$2.4 billion in user
    fees, according to Democratic appropriators --- thereby providing
    the FDA with a total of \$5.4 billion in funding for operations in
    FY 2019. That total is \$292 million more than FY 2018 but \$239
    million less than requested. The direct appropriation is \$159
    million more than FY 2018 but \$213 million less than requested; the
    administration also requested that new user fees be added. The
    measure also includes \$12 million for FDA buildings and facilities,
    equal to both FY 2018 and the request." \[Congressional Quarterly,

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For An FY 2019 Transportation And HUD
Appropriations Bill That Would End A Portion Of The Partial Government
Shutdown Without Funding For Trump's Wall.** In January 2019,
Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"provide\[d\] \$71.4 billion for transportation programs for fiscal 2019
and provide for the release of \$49 billion from the highway and
aviation trust funds. It would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$49.3 billion for
federal highway programs; \$17.7 billion for the Federal Aviation
Administration; \$13.5 billion for mass transit; and \$2.8 billion for
railroads. The bill would \[have\] provide\[d\] \$44.5 billion for
programs and activities of the Housing and Urban Development Department.
From this amount, as well as offsets from payments collected by the
Federal Housing Administration, the bill would \[have\] provide\[d\]
\$31.3 billion for public and Indian housing programs and \$22.8 billion
for the Section 8 rental assistance voucher program." The vote was on

-   **The Bill Was Not A Democrat Bill, But Was Virtually Identical To
    The Bill Passed By The Senate In 2018.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "According to Democratic appropriators, the spending
    bills being considered this week are virtually identical to the
    versions that passed the Senate by a 92-6 vote, except for
    'technical, conforming, and necessary scorekeeping changes' --- with
    the only substantial changes being that each bill now also includes
    provisions to retroactively pay federal workers who were furloughed
    during the partial shutdown." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **About 95 Percent Of HUD Has Had Its Staff Furloughed, Which Has
    Meant A Suspension Of Health And Safety Inspections, Among Other
    Things.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "For the Housing and
    Urban Development Department (HUD), 95% of its staff has been
    furloughed, which according to news reports has resulted in the
    suspension of mandatory health and safety inspections of housing for
    low-income families, the elderly and individuals with disabilities.
    About 1,500 landlords operate units covered by a HUD program that
    expired on Jan. 1 and which cannot be renewed until HUD receives
    funding, raising the risk of tenants being evicted. The Federal
    Housing Administration, meanwhile, is unable to process loans and
    loan approvals which could delay the purchase of homes by new
    homeowners." \[Congressional Quarterly,

    Things.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "On the
    transportation side, Federal Aviation Administration air traffic
    control services and aviation safety activities continue but other
    FAA activities have been halted, including the training of new air
    traffic controllers, the issuance of new pilot licenses and medical
    certificates, and the registration of aircraft. And while the
    Federal Highway Administration is not affected because it is funded
    from the Highway Trust Fund, the vast majority of Federal Transit
    Administration employees are furloughed with most non-safety
    activities curtailed." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **The Legislation Appropriated \$175 Million For The Essential Air
    Service.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill
    appropriates \$175 million from the aviation trust fund to be used
    by the Office of the Secretary for the Essential Air Service (EAS)
    program, which subsidizes airline carriers for service to smaller
    communities. The amount provided is \$20 million (13%) more than FY
    2018 and \$82 million (88%) more than requested. In addition, the
    administration has estimated that overflight fees by aircraft
    crossing U.S. airspace, which can be applied to the EAS program,

-   **The Bill Provided \$1.9 Billion For Amtrak.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The bill provides \$1.9 billion for Amtrak
    (formally the National Railroad Passenger Corporation) --- equal to
    2018 funding but \$1.2 billion more than requested. Of the total
    provided, \$650 million is for Amtrak\'s Northeast Corridor
    operations (equal to FY 2018 and \$450 million more than requested)
    and \$1.3 billion is for Amtrak\'s National Network (equal to FY
    2018 and \$754 million more than requested). The measure requires at
    least \$50 million be used to bring Amtrak-served facilities and
    stations on the Northeast Corridor into compliance with the
    Americans with Disabilities Act, and that another \$50 million or
    more be used for railroad safety technology, including positive
    train control, on Amtrak\'s National Network. The measure continues
    to limit overtime to \$35,000 per employee --- but it allows
    Amtrak\'s president to waive this restriction for specific employees
    for safety or operational efficiency reasons. Amtrak must submit to
    Congress a report on overtime payments made in FY 2018 and the three
    previous years." \[Congressional Quarterly,

    measure appropriates a total of \$416 million for the Office of
    National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), which is responsible for
    developing policies, objectives and priorities for the National Drug
    Control Program. The total is slightly more than FY 2018 and \$386
    million more than requested. Within that total for ONDCP, the
    measure provides \$280 million for the High Intensity Drug
    Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Program, rejecting the administration\'s
    proposal to defund the program. HIDTA provides assistance to
    federal, state and local law enforcement units operating in areas
    that are most adversely affected by drug trafficking and have been
    designated as high-traffic areas. It also provides \$117 million
    (slightly more than FY 2018) for other federal drug control
    programs, such as the drug free communities program. The
    administration proposed just \$12 million for these other programs.
    ONDCP is encouraged to ensure that rural and underserved areas that

    is designed to exert maximum pressure on Senate Republicans to
    simply reopen the rest of the government while punting the border

    bid to Republicans on the first day of the 116th Congress, and the
    13th day of a partial government shutdown that began after lawmakers

2018, Fitzpatrick voted for a continuing resolution funding a
significant portion of government through February 8, 2019 as well as
allocating \$5.7 billion for President Trump's border wall. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "The bill is the legislative vehicle for a
short-term continuing resolution that would fund the government through

without the additional border wall funding that President Donald Trump
is insisting be included --- to the floor as a privileged resolution.
\[...\] \[Pelosi\] justified her use of the privileged resolution, which
is a procedural move that gives one House action precedence over the
regular order of business and allows a resolution to leapfrog or
interrupt other pending matters before the chamber. \[...\] Earlier in

stopgap funding bill GOP leaders put forward this week, escalating the
odds of a partial government shutdown after Friday at midnight, when
