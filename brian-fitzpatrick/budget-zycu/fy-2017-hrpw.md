"provide\[d\] \$1.16 trillion in discretionary appropriations through
Sept. 30, 2017 for federal departments and agencies covered by the
remaining 11 fiscal 2017 spending bills. \[...\] The measure would also
\[have\] provide\[d\] \$608 million for health benefits for retired coal
miners, \$296 million for Medicaid payments to Puerto Rico, and \$341
million to replace 40 miles of existing fencing along the southwestern
border, though the designs of the fencing must have been 'previously
deployed'." The vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendments.

signed it into law. \[House Vote 249,

244](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/244/all-actions)\]

-   **Funding For The Federal Government Would Have Expired On May 5.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "With the April 28 expiration
    of government funding approaching, Congress late last week enacted a
    one-week extension of the CR through Friday, May 5, to give
    negotiators time to work out remaining issues and for Congress to
    consider the omnibus measure." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/2/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5094280?4)\]

-   **The Legislation Did Not Include '160 Poison Pill Riders.'**
    According to Roll Call, "Appearing with Schumer on Monday afternoon,
    Leahy said the way Democrats 'were able to knock out 160 poison pill
    riders --- 160 --- in \[the GOP's\] proposal demonstrates that, at
    least among the grown-ups in both parties, in both bodies, they
    wanted to get down to doing it the way we are supposed to.'" \[Roll
    Call,

-   **Legislation Did Not Include A Dollar For Dollar Increase In
    Defense And Non-Defense Spending.** According to The Hill, "Speaker
    Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is touting this week's budget deal for breaking
    the rule that Democrats enforced under President Obama: Every dollar
    in increased defense spending had to be matched by a dollar increase
    for nondefense discretionary programs. 'Under the Obama rules, if
    you wanted to help the military, if you wanted a pay raise for the
    soldiers, if you wanted to buy new airplanes and new ships and more
    munitions, a dollar for that, you had to have a dollar domestic
    spending. We just broke that parity,' Ryan said at a press
    conference Tuesday morning. 'That's the biggest victory we could
    have had --- \$25 billion year over year for our military, to begin
    to rebuild our military, without that kind of corresponding increase
    in domestic discretionary spending. That, to me, is very important,'
    he added." \[The Hill,
