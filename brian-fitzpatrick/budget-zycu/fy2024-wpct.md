### Consolidated Appropriations

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Second Half Of The FY 2024
Consolidated Appropriations.** In March 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for ,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "the resolution (H Res 1102) that
would provide for the House to concur in the Senate amendment to the
legislative vehicle (HR 2882) with an amendment that would provide \$1.2
trillion in total budget authority for the Defense, Financial Services,
Homeland Security, Legislative Branch, Labor-HHS-Education and State
Foreign Operations spending bills. It would provide \$825 billion for
the Defense department; \$26.1 billion for Financial Services and
general government; \$89.8 billion for the Homeland Security Department;
\$224.7 billion for the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education
Departments; \$6.7 billion for legislative branch; and \$58.3 billion
for the State Department. It would provide \$300 million for the Ukraine
Security Assistance Initiative and \$500 million for Israel defense
programs. Among its policy provisions, it would extend the National
Flood Insurance Program through Sept. 30, 2024; prohibit the use of
funding in fiscal years 2024 or 2025 to make any payment to the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency; and increase the number of Immigration
and Customs Enforcement detention beds from 34,000 to 41,500." The vote
was passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 286 to 134.

-   **Conservatives Criticized The Amount Spent In The Package While
    Progressives Criticized The Homeland Security Appropriations And The
    Removal Of Funding For Palestinian Refugees.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "On the right: Senate and House
    conservatives who believe it spends too much. On the left:
    progressive Democrats and advocates who are unhappy with the
    Homeland Security bill and removal of funding for the United Nations
    Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/21/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7969648?17)\]

-   **The Homeland Security Bill Increased Funding For Customs Detention
    Beds And Border Patrol Agents While Decreasing Aid To Migrants By
    Almost 20 Percent.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "That
    measure included a significant increase in Immigration and Customs
    Enforcement detention beds, from 34,000 in current law (PL 117-328)
    to 41,500 in this bill, as well as increased funding for U.S. Border
    Patrol agents. House Homeland Security Appropriations Chairman David
    Joyce, R-Ohio, said the bill is good for Republicans, who received
    'a lot of concessions' from Democrats. 'It's not everything I
    wanted, but it's a good bill,' he said. Democrats did successfully
    zero out money for the border wall in the legislation, which House
    Homeland Security Appropriations ranking member Henry Cuellar,
    D-Texas, heralded as his 'biggest priority. While Cueller said he
    wished the bill could have maintained the current funding level for
    the nongovernmental organizations providing aid to migrants, House
    Republicans had sought steeper cuts than the nearly 20 percent
    reduction that ended up in the bill.'" \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/21/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7969648?17)\]

-   **The Bill Banned Obligating Pre-Existing Funds For UNRWA Through FY
    2025 And Did Not Include Any FY 2024 Funding.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "One provision progressives are unhappy
    with is the bill's continued block on funding for UNRWA. The Biden
    administration blocked funding for the organization following
    Israel's allegations that UNRWA workers participated in Hamas' Oct.
    7 attack. The law bans obligating pre-existing funds for the agency
    through March 2025 and does not include any fiscal 2024 funding for
    the agency, a top priority of House State-Foreign Operations
    Appropriations Chairman Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. Congressional
    Democrats, however, had argued that UNRWA is the only organization
    able to provide Gaza the amount of aid it needs. Rep. Ro Khanna,
    D-Calif., said he would vote against the package due to the
    provision, which he said would lead to famine in Gaza. 'America
    should not be indifferent to children dying of dehydration and
    starvation because of man-made famine,' Khanna, another Progressive
    Caucus member, said. 'And there's no way to have aid distributed
    into Gaza without that distribution system.'" \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [3/21/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7969648?17)\]

-   **Conservatives Objected To Various Earmarks, Including Funding For
    A Youth Services Organization That Provides LGBTQ Youth With
    Gender-Affirming Clothing.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "Senate and House conservatives were, predictably, also unhappy with
    the giant spending package. 'Classic DC swamp at it again. Spend,
    spend, spend. I've had it!' Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., wrote
    Thursday on X, formerly Twitter. Norman laid out some earmarks in
    the package that he objected to, including a \$400,000 project
    secured by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. for Briarpatch Youth Services
    in Fitchburg, Wisconsin, an organization that helps homeless and
    at-risk youth. The organization provides gender-affirming clothing
    to LGBTQ teens, which Norman objects to." \[Congressional Quarterly,

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted For The First Half Of The FY 2024 Consolidated
Appropriations.** In March 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for , according to
Congressional Quarterly, "the resolution (H Res 1061) that would provide
for the House to concur in the Senate amendment to the legislative
vehicle (HR 4366) with an amendment that would provide \$467.5 billion
in total funding for six, full-year spending bills for fiscal 2024.
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION-VA: Together with funds appropriated in the fiscal
2023 bill and the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, it would provide
\$346.7 billion for military construction, the Department of Veterans
Affairs, and related agencies, including \$18.7 billion for military
construction initiatives, \$135.25 billion in discretionary funding and
\$172.5 billion in mandatory funding for the VA. AGRICULTURE: It would
provide \$26.3 billion in discretionary funding to the Department of
Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and related agencies. It
also would provide a total of \$7.03 billion to fully fund the Women,
Infants and Children nutrition assistance program, an increase of \$4.03
billion over fiscal 2023. COMMERCE, JUSTICE, and SCIENCE: It would
provide \$81.8 billion in discretionary spending for the Commerce,
Justice and Science programs, including \$10.83 billion for Commerce
Department programs and \$37.5 billion for Justice Department programs.
It also would provide \$24.9 billion for NASA. ENERGY-WATER: It would
provide \$58.2 billion in discretionary funding for Energy and Water and
related agencies funding, including \$50.2 billion for the Energy
Department and \$8.7 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers.
INTERIOR-ENVIRONMENT: It would provide \$38.6 billion discretionary
spending for the Interior Department, EPA and related agencies. It also
would provide \$2.6 billion under a separate wildfire suppression cap
adjustment. TRANSPORTATION-HUD: It would provide \$103 billion in
discretionary spending for federal transportation and housing programs."
The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 339 to
85, thus it was sent to the Senate. The Senate passed the bill by a vote
of 75 to 22 and was signed into law by President Biden. \[House Vote 64,

-   **The Bill Increased Overall Funding By \$1.5 Billion From FY 2023
    While Cutting All Non-Discretionary, Non-VA Funding.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The first grouping would provide a \$1.5
    billion increase, or 0.3 percent, over the comparable enacted fiscal
    2023 level (PL 117-328), though even that slim boost is somewhat of
    an accounting trick. It technically ignores \$2 billion in increased
    fiscal 2023 Energy Department spending offset by tapping unused
    Strategic Petroleum Reserve funds, for example. And after backing
    out veterans health care, all other nondefense programs would be cut
    slightly below the previous year\'s level --- something GOP leaders
    have been touting as a selling point within their conference. 'We
    only control half of one-third of the federal government, so we have
    to be realistic about what we are able to achieve,' Johnson, R-La.,
    said Wednesday. 'But in spite of that, we have an appropriations
    package that is going to cut non-defense, non-VA discretionary
    spending.' The Agriculture bill remains flat under the legislation,
    and the Commerce-Justice-Science and Interior-Environment bills
    would both see cuts of around 3 percent. Agencies ranging from EPA
    to the National Science Foundation to the Justice Department face
    hefty reductions from the prior year." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/6/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7954880?44)\]

-   **The Bill Contained A Provision That Overturned A Law That
    Prohibited Veterans Deemed Incompetent Of Managing Their Finances
    From Purchasing Guns And Ammunition.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "That provision would overturn a 1993 law which prevents
    veterans deemed incompetent to manage their finances by the
    Department of Veterans Affairs from purchasing guns and ammunition.
    Under the new language, such veterans seeking to buy firearms could
    get a judicial hearing." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/6/24](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7954880?44)\]

-   **Republicans Removed Funding For A Philadelphia LGBTQ Center From
    The Bill.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "A \$1 million
    earmark that would fund the renovation of a LGBTQ community center
    in Pennsylvania was stripped from the six-bill spending package
    under consideration this week after backlash from Republicans
    threatened to sink the legislation. The earmark that would support
    Philadelphia's William Way LGBT Community Center was initially
    included in the fiscal 2024 spending package (HR 4366), but has been
    removed from the latest list of 'congressionally directed spending'
    projects. Republicans pushed for the funding's removal after a
    conservative activist found a fetish group hosts a monthly party at
    the community center." \[Congressional Quarterly,

### Continuing Appropriations

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Third FY 2024 Continuing Resolution
Which Maintained Current Spending Levels With Two Exceptions.** In
January 2024, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted
for the "motion to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment
to the bill that would extend stopgap funding through March 1, 2024, for
the Agriculture, Energy-Water, Military Construction-VA and
Transportation-HUD spending bills; and would extend funding through
March 8, 2024, for the Commerce-Justice-Science, Defense, Financial
Services, Homeland Security, Interior-Environment, Labor-HHS-Education,
Legislative Branch and State-Foreign Operations spending bills. In two
exceptions to current funding levels, the bill would allow the National
Nuclear Security Administration to spend up to \$760 million to avoid
issuing layoff notices for its uranium processing facility construction
project in Oak Ridge, Tenn. It would also allow funding for the Federal
Aviation Administration to be apportioned to meet mandated pay raises
and ensure no adverse impacts on air safety. Among other provisions, it
also would extend, through March 8, certain Health and Human Services
Department programs, including community health centers and child
welfare programs." The vote was on concurring in the Senate amendment.
The House concurred by a vote of 314 to 108, thus it was sent to
President Biden who signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 15,

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Second FY 2024 Continuing
Resolution.** In November 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted for "the Agriculture, Energy-Water, Military
Construction-VA, and Transportation-HUD spending bills; and would extend
funding through Feb. 2, 2024 for the Commerce-Justice-Science, Defense,
Financial Services, Homeland Security, Labor-HHS-Education, Legislative
Branch and State-Foreign Operations spending bills. Among other
provisions, the bill would extend, through Sept. 30, 2024, agricultural
programs authorized by the 2018 Farm Bill. It also would extend, through
Jan. 19, 2024, certain Health and Human Services programs, including
community health centers and child welfare programs. The bill would not
include any funding for Israel, Ukraine or Taiwan." The vote was on
passage. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 336 to 95. \[House

-   **The Stopgap Extended Funding For Agencies For Different Periods Of
    Time At The Fiscal 2023 Spending Levels With No Policy Changes.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The continuing resolution
    (HR 6363) from Johnson, R-La., would extend funding for agencies for
    different periods of time, an uncommon maneuver. It faced
    last-minute opposition Tuesday from the House Freedom Caucus, but
    ultimately passed with bipartisan support. The new speaker\'s
    decision to push a stopgap bill at the fiscal 2023 spending levels
    with no policy changes angered some right-wing Republicans, but
    ultimately enabled nearly every Democrat to lend their support."

### Energy And Water Appropriations

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted For The FY 2024 Energy-Water Appropriations.**
In October 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted
for "Passage of the bill, as amended, that would provide \$60 billion in
fiscal 2024 funding for the Energy Department, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation and independent federal agencies.
It would provide \$49 billion for the Energy Department, \$24 billion
for the National Nuclear Security Administration, and \$2.8 billion for
the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. Within NNSA funding, it would provide
\$19.1 billion appropriated for weapons activities, \$1.9 billion for
naval reactors and \$2.4 billion for defense nuclear nonproliferation.
The bill would provide \$2 billion for the Energy Efficiency and
Renewable Energy Office. It would redirect \$3.6 billion in unobligated
funds previously appropriated by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law
for advanced nuclear reactor demonstration programs, including \$2.4
billion for advanced nuclear fuel and \$1.2 billion for small modular
reactor research and development. The funding for each would be evenly
distributed over the next three fiscal years. It would provide \$470
million for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, \$281 million
for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and \$858 million for the Office of
Fossil Energy and Carbon Management. The bill would provide \$9.6
billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. For programs within the
Interior Department, the bill would provide \$1.9 billion, including
\$1.7 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation and \$23 million for the
Central Utah Project. It would also prohibit the use of funds provided
by the bill to finalize an Energy Department rule proposed in February
2023, on energy conservation standards for gas ranges and ovens, or any
rule that would directly or indirectly limit consumer access to gas
kitchen ranges or ovens." The vote was on the amendment. The House

    the scope of the department's diversity and inclusion programs and
    preventing any action being taken against an employee who acts on
    their belief that marriage should not be extended to same-sex
    couples." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **The Bill Blocked The Implementation Of The Industrial

-   **The Bill Prohibited The Use Of Funds For The American Climate
    Corps.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "by a vote of 208-209
    the House narrowly defeated an amendment from Rep. Ralph Norman,
    R-S.C., that would have prohibited funding for the American Climate
    Corps, a program launched last month through executive action.
    However, because the votes of the delegates representing U.S.
    territories were decisive the House voted again, and the amendment

    debate that provision next week, when the Legislative Branch
    spending bill (HR 4364) is expected on the floor. Republicans must
    have had a change of heart after hearing concerns, however. After
    debate on the stopgap bill resumed Saturday, Legislative Branch
    Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Mark Amodei said Republicans
    would fix it to 'include the Senate\'s genius language' blocking the
    member pay raise. The House then agreed by unanimous consent to add

programs. It would fund veterans' programs, the Department of Homeland
Security, national security programs and disaster assistance at full
fiscal 2023 levels. It would also implement nearly all provisions of
House Republicans' border security and immigration bill (HR 2), which

operation on Jan. 20, 2021; and require DHS to return all unaccompanied
children to their country of origin, regardless of whether they are from

transporting inadmissible adults into the U.S., and the use of Customs
and Border Protection's 'CBP One' app to facilitate the parole of an
