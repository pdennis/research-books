# Hurricane Irma

### 2018 Funding

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For A February 2018 Two-Year Budget Deal
Which, Among Other Things, Increased Spending By \$300 Billion,
Suspended The Debt Ceiling And Provided Nearly \$90 Billion In Disaster
Relief For The 2017 Hurricanes And Wildfires.** In February 2018,
Fitzpatrick voted for a two-year budget deal that re-opened the
government after a brief shutdown. According to the New York Times,
"With Mr. Trump's signature, the government will reopen before many
Americans were aware it had closed, with a deal that includes about
\$300 billion in additional funds over two years for military and
nonmilitary programs, almost \$90 billion in disaster relief in response
to last year's hurricanes and wildfires, and a higher statutory debt
ceiling." In addition, according to Congressional Quarterly, the
legislation "would provide funding for federal government operations and
services at current levels through March 23, 2018 \[...\] \[and\]
retroactively extends numerous tax breaks that expired at the end of
2016. It also extends the CHIP program for another four years (through
FY 2027) and funds community health centers for another two years." The
vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the House
amendment to the bill. The House agreed to the motion, essentially on
passage, by a vote of 240 to 186. The bill was then sent to the
president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 69,

-   **Legislation Provided \$51.5 Billion In FEMA Funding, \$23.5 To The
    Disaster Relief Fund And \$28 Billion To Community Development Block
    Grants.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Of the total \$89.3
    billion provided, \$51.5 billion goes to two major federal response
    and recovery program accounts: the Federal Emergency Management
    Agency's (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (\$23.5 billion), which is the
    government's primary source for immediate disaster relief, for
    continued response and recovery activities; and the Housing and
    Urban Development Department's Community Development Block Grant
    Program (\$28 billion) to help communities rebuild homes and
    infrastructure and prepare for future disasters." \[Congressional

    Medicaid Funding For Puerto Rico And The U.S. Virgin Islands.**

    \[...\] \$4.9 billion in additional Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico
    and the U.S. Virgin Islands." \[Congressional Quarterly,

### Recovery Funding

**2018: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against Requiring The Army
Secretary Restore And Improve Public Infrastructure Damaged By
Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Or Maria.** In June 2018, Fitzpatrick
effectively voted against an amendment that would have, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] the secretary of the Army to
restore and improve the public infrastructure in the continental United
States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands that was damaged as a
result of Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma or Hurricane Maria." The
underlying legislation was a water bill. The vote was on a motion to
recommit. The House rejected the motion, thereby defeating the
amendment, by a vote of 180 to 227. \[House Vote 237,

and Maria and wildfires from 2017. According to Congressional Quarterly,
