# Tax Relief

### 2018 Disasters

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For A \$100 Billion Tax Bill That Delayed ACA
Taxes, Included Tax Relief For Disaster Victims And Offered Fixes For
The 2017 Tax Reform Bill.** In December 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for
legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"provide\[d\] tax relief to individuals and businesses who have been
harmed by certain natural disasters during 2018 and \[...\] \[made\] it
easier for small businesses to offer retirement savings plans for their
employees while also giving individuals greater flexibility to
contribute to and use funds from their retirement accounts. It also
allow\[ed\] churches and other non-profits to become politically active
while maintaining their tax-exempt status; delay\[ed\] or repeal\[ed\]
four taxes created by the 2010 health care overhaul to finance that law;
\[made\] certain modifications and technical corrections to the 2017 tax
overhaul; and modernize\[d\] the IRS to improve customer service and
help prevent identity theft and tax return fraud." The vote was on a
motion to concur in the Senate amendment with a further House amendment.
The House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of
220 to 183. The bill died in the Senate. \[House Vote 470,

-   **Bill Created Tax Cuts For People And Business -- Such As Access To
    Retirement Funds Without A Penalty And Allowing Deductions For
    Personal Casualty Disaster Losses - Impacted By The 2018 Natural
    Disasters.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill
    provides various forms of tax relief to individuals and businesses
    who have been harmed by declared natural disasters that hit the
    United States and its territories during 2018 --- including by
    allowing access to retirement funds without a tax penalty,
    suspending limits on deductions for charitable contributions,
    allowing deductions for personal casualty disaster losses,
    establishing special rules for measuring earned income to qualify
    for tax credits, and establishing a special credit for businesses to
    retain employees. Specifically, it provides disaster tax relief for
    individuals and businesses affected by hurricanes Florence and
    Michael in the eastern U.S.; typhoons Mangkhut and Yutu and Tropical
    Storm Gita in the Pacific; the Mendocino, Camp and Woolsey wildfires
    in California; the volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, flooding, and
    landslides in Hawaii; and various storms, flooding, tornadoes and
    landslides in Alabama, Indiana, North Carolina, Texas and
    Wisconsin." \[Congressional Quarterly,
