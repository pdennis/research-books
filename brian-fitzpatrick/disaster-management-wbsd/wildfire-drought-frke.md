# Wildfire And Drought

### Prevention, Response And Mitigation

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Support A Prevention, Response And
Mitigation Package To Address Wildfires And Droughts.** In July 2022,
according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the
Continental Divide Trail Completion Act, which would "include a range of
provisions to support prevention, response and mitigation related to
wildfires, drought and other natural disasters." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 218-199, thus the bill
was sent to the Senate. The Senate did not take substantive action on
the bill. \[House Vote 414,
