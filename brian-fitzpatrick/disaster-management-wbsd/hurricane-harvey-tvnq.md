### 2018 Funding

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For A February 2018 Two-Year Budget Deal
Which, Among Other Things, Increased Spending By \$300 Billion,
Suspended The Debt Ceiling And Provided Nearly \$90 Billion In Disaster
Relief For The 2017 Hurricanes And Wildfires.** In February 2018,
Fitzpatrick voted for a two-year budget deal that re-opened the
government after a brief shutdown. According to the New York Times,
"With Mr. Trump's signature, the government will reopen before many
Americans were aware it had closed, with a deal that includes about
\$300 billion in additional funds over two years for military and
nonmilitary programs, almost \$90 billion in disaster relief in response
to last year's hurricanes and wildfires, and a higher statutory debt
ceiling." In addition, according to Congressional Quarterly, the
legislation "would provide funding for federal government operations and
services at current levels through March 23, 2018 \[...\] \[and\]
retroactively extends numerous tax breaks that expired at the end of
2016. It also extends the CHIP program for another four years (through
FY 2027) and funds community health centers for another two years." The
vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the House
amendment to the bill. The House agreed to the motion, essentially on
passage, by a vote of 240 to 186. The bill was then sent to the
president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 69,

-   **Legislation Provided \$51.5 Billion In FEMA Funding, \$23.5 To The
    Disaster Relief Fund And \$28 Billion To Community Development Block
    Grants.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Of the total \$89.3
    billion provided, \$51.5 billion goes to two major federal response
    and recovery program accounts: the Federal Emergency Management
    Agency's (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (\$23.5 billion), which is the
    government's primary source for immediate disaster relief, for
    continued response and recovery activities; and the Housing and
    Urban Development Department's Community Development Block Grant
    Program (\$28 billion) to help communities rebuild homes and
    infrastructure and prepare for future disasters." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [2/8/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5262332?20)\]

-   **Legislation Also Provided Nearly \$5 Billion In Additional
    Medicaid Funding For Puerto Rico And The U.S. Virgin Islands.**

    \[...\] \$4.9 billion in additional Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico
    and the U.S. Virgin Islands." \[Congressional Quarterly,

### October Relief

**2017: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted For Emergency Hurricane And
Wildfire Appropriations, Which Included \$36.5 Billion In Emergency
Spending.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick effectively voted for
legislation that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "make
available \$36.5 billion in emergency supplemental funding for fiscal
2018 to partially cover the costs of responding to multiple natural
disasters, including hurricanes and wildfires. The measure would include
\$18.7 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster
Relief Fund - \$4.9 billion of which would be used for disaster relief
loans to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It would also cancel
\$16 billion of the Treasury debt incurred by FEMA's National Flood
Insurance Program, would release \$1.2 billion in contingency reserves
from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for use in Puerto
Rico would provide \$577 million in funding to fight wildfires." The
vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and agree to a resolution that
would have effectively concurred in the Senate amendment to H.R. 2266
with a House amendment. The House agreed to the motion, thereby
effectively passing the legislation, by a vote of 353 to 69. The Senate
later passed the legislation and the president later signed it into law.

### Recovery Funding

**2018: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted Against Requiring The Army
Secretary Restore And Improve Public Infrastructure Damaged By
Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Or Maria.** In June 2018, Fitzpatrick
effectively voted against an amendment that would have, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "require\[d\] the secretary of the Army to
restore and improve the public infrastructure in the continental United
States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands that was damaged as a
result of Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma or Hurricane Maria." The
underlying legislation was a water bill. The vote was on a motion to
recommit. The House rejected the motion, thereby defeating the
amendment, by a vote of 180 to 227. \[House Vote 237,

### September Deal

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For Trump's Emergency Harvey Relief, Debt
Ceiling And CR Deal With The Democrats Which Provided \$15.25 Billion In
Emergency Hurricane Relief.** In September 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for
legislation that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"ma\[d\]e available \$15.25 billion in emergency supplemental funding
for fiscal 2017 to partially cover the costs of responding to multiple
natural disasters, including Hurricane Harvey. The amendment would
\[have\] suspend\[ed\] the public debt limit from the bill's date of
enactment until Dec. 8, 2017, and would \[have\] provide\[d\] for
government operations to be funded at fiscal 2017 levels until Dec. 8."
The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 316 to
90. The Senate earlier had agreed to the legislation and President Trump
then signed the legislation into the law. \[House Vote 480,

-   **Trump Sided With The Democrat's Negotiating Stance Of Suspending
    The Debt Limit For Three Months And Extending Government Funding For
    Three Months.** According to the Washington Post, "Trump made his
    position clear at a White House meeting with both parties'
    congressional leaders, agreeing with Senate Minority Leader
    Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi
    (D-Calif.) on plans for a bill to fund the government and raise the
    debt ceiling for three months. \[...\] In siding with Democrats,
    Trump overruled his own treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who was
    in the middle of an explanation backing a longer-term increase when
    the president interrupted him and disagreed, according to a person
    briefed on the meeting who was not authorized to comment publicly
    and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Trump was 'in deal-cutting
    mode,' the person said. After the gathering, McConnell said he would
    add provisions extending government funding and the debt limit
    through mid-December to legislation passed by the House on Wednesday
    providing \$7.85 billion in Hurricane Harvey relief. McConnell
    introduced the legislation late Wednesday night, setting up a Senate
    vote as early as Friday." \[Washington Post,

and Maria and wildfires from 2017. According to Congressional Quarterly,
"Passage of the bill that would make further supplemental appropriations
for fiscal 2018 for disaster assistance for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and

on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 251 to 169. The
Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 709,
