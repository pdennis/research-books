### 2018 Funding

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For A February 2018 Two-Year Budget Deal
Which, Among Other Things, Increased Spending By \$300 Billion,
Suspended The Debt Ceiling And Provided Nearly \$90 Billion In Disaster
Relief For The 2017 Hurricanes And Wildfires.** In February 2018,
Fitzpatrick voted for a two-year budget deal that re-opened the
government after a brief shutdown. According to the New York Times,
"With Mr. Trump's signature, the government will reopen before many
Americans were aware it had closed, with a deal that includes about
\$300 billion in additional funds over two years for military and
nonmilitary programs, almost \$90 billion in disaster relief in response
to last year's hurricanes and wildfires, and a higher statutory debt
ceiling." In addition, according to Congressional Quarterly, the
legislation "would provide funding for federal government operations and
services at current levels through March 23, 2018 \[...\] \[and\]
retroactively extends numerous tax breaks that expired at the end of
2016. It also extends the CHIP program for another four years (through
FY 2027) and funds community health centers for another two years." The
vote was on a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the House
amendment to the bill. The House agreed to the motion, essentially on
passage, by a vote of 240 to 186. The bill was then sent to the
president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 69,

    and recovery program accounts: the Federal Emergency Management
    Agency's (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (\$23.5 billion), which is the
    government's primary source for immediate disaster relief, for
    continued response and recovery activities; and the Housing and
    Urban Development Department's Community Development Block Grant
    Program (\$28 billion) to help communities rebuild homes and
    infrastructure and prepare for future disasters." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [2/8/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5262332?20)\]

-   **The Package Included Funds For Food Stamps, Fixing The Electric
    Grid, And Expanding The Child Tax Credit Benefits.** According to

    \$3.3 billion in grant funding for disaster relief, \$210 million to
    bolster the island's food stamp program and \$18 million for
    technical assistance that would in part support the faltering
    electric grid in Puerto Rico and other territories. It includes a
    tax relief package that, among other provisions, expands child tax
    credit benefits for residents of Puerto Rico and increases the
    amount of money collected from rum excise taxes diverted back to the
    governments of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands."

-   **Trump Has Opposed Efforts To Send Federal Aid To Puerto Rico, And
    Republicans Have Sided With The President.** According to the New
    York Times, "Mr. Trump has been hostile to the idea of sending
    federal money to the island, and the White House has warned that it
    will veto the package. And Senate Republicans, emerging from the
    impeachment trial, may have similar reservations about the
    legislation, particularly given the administration's objections."

    [2/7/20](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/politics/house-puerto-rico-aid-package.html)\]

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For \$81 Billion In Supplemental Aid For The

and Maria and wildfires from 2017. According to Congressional Quarterly,

2017 hurricanes and wildfires, and would authorize Puerto Rico to use
surplus toll credits to cover the local share of federal highway
emergency relief. The bill would remove a cap on federal highway
assistance to U.S. territories for fiscal 2018 and 2019." The vote was
on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 251 to 169. The
Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 709,

-   **Legislation Didn't Include Medicaid Funding For Puerto Rico.**
    According to Politico, "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New
    York ticked off a long list of problems with the bill, mostly
    related to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Specifically, he
    called for more help for Puerto Rico's cash-strapped Medicaid
    program and fixes to the GOP's tax bill to prevent a
    disproportionate hike in taxes on the island." \[Politico,
    [12/21/17](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/21/house-passes-massive-disaster-aid-package-312413)\]

**2017: Fitzpatrick Effectively Voted For Emergency Hurricane And
Wildfire Appropriations, Which Included \$36.5 Billion In Emergency
Spending Which In Part Included \$4.9 Billion In Loans To Puerto Rico
And The U.S. Virgin Islands.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick effectively
voted for legislation that would, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"make available \$36.5 billion in emergency supplemental funding for
fiscal 2018 to partially cover the costs of responding to multiple
natural disasters, including hurricanes and wildfires. The measure would
include \$18.7 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's
Disaster Relief Fund - \$4.9 billion of which would be used for disaster
relief loans to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It would also
cancel \$16 billion of the Treasury debt incurred by FEMA's National
Flood Insurance Program, would release \$1.2 billion in contingency
reserves from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for use in
Puerto Rico would provide \$577 million in funding to fight wildfires."
The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and agree to a resolution
that would have effectively concurred in the Senate amendment to H.R.
2266 with a House amendment. The House agreed to the motion, thereby
effectively passing the legislation, by a vote of 353 to 69. The Senate
later passed the legislation and the president later signed it into law.
