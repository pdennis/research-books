### Funding

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For The \$1.3 Trillion FY 2018 Omnibus
Spending Deal Which Raised Spending By \$138 Billion Over FY 2017
Levels, Including \$8.3 Billion In CDC Funding.** In March 2018,
Fitzpatrick voted for the FY 2018 Omnibus spending bill. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "Combined, the spending measures would provide
about \$1.3 trillion in discretionary spending, with \$1.2 trillion
subject to discretionary spending caps, and \$78.1 billion designated as
Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The measure\'s spending levels
are consistent with the increased defense and non-defense budget caps
set by the two-year budget deal agreed to last month. That agreement
increased the FY 2018 defense cap by \$80 billion and the non-defense
cap by \$63 billion. Given that the previous caps were set to reduce
overall discretionary spending by \$5 billion, the net increase provided
by the omnibus is \$138 billion over the FY 2017 level." The vote was on
the motion to concur in the Senate Amendment with an Amendment. The
House agreed to the motion, thereby passing the bill, by a vote of 256
to 167. The Senate later agreed to the legislation, sending it to the
president, who signed it into law. \[House Vote 127,

-   **Omnibus Appropriated \$8.3 Billion For The CDC Which Is \$1.1
    Billon More Than FY 2017 Funding.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The measure provides a total of \$8.3 billion for
    activities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
    --- including \$7.2 billion in discretionary funding and \$801
    million from the Prevention and Public Health (PPH) Fund created by
    the 2010 health care law. Total available funding for the CDC would
    be \$1.1 billion (14%) more than comparable FY 2017 funding and
    \$2.3 billion (38%) more than requested." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [3/22/18](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5287294?5)\]

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The American Health Care Act That
Would Eliminated The CDC's Prevention And Public Health Fund.** In May
2017, Fitzpatrick voted against the American Health Care Act which would
have significantly repealed portions of the Affordable Care Act by
cutting Medicaid, cutting taxes on the rich, removing safeguard for
pre-existing conditions and defunding Planned Parenthood. According to
CNN, "Public health advocates are warning lawmakers the GOP plan to
repeal Obamacare will eliminate nearly \$1 billion in Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention funding used for programs like preventing
disease outbreaks and childhood lead poisoning. But Republican critics
say the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which amounts to 12% of
CDC\'s budget, is a 'slush fund' that has been spent on Zumba classes
and massage sessions. Their proposal includes a new fund that they say
provides states 'broad flexibility' to address local health concerns.
The Republican bill would eliminate the fund, created under the
Affordable Care Act, which has grown from a small slice of the CDC
budget to providing \$931 million last year." The vote was on passage.
The House passed the bill by a vote of 217 to 213. The bill, in modified
forms, died in the Senate. \[House Vote 256,

-   **Director Of The Big Cities Health Coalition Chrissie Juliano: The
    Fund Funds Vaccines For The Flu, Measles, Mumps, Track Emergence Of
    Diseases Like Zika And Ebola, And Address Foodborne Illnesses Such
    As Salmonella.** According to Chrissie Juliano, director of the Big
    Cities Health Coalition, "At the macro level, the Prevention and
    Public Health Fund supports and fights a multitude of health threats
    that do not respect state or national borders. Immunization programs
    supported by the fund ensure access to vaccines that protect the
    most vulnerable among us from routine diseases like the flu, and
    recently re-occurring ones like mumps or measles. The fund also
    supports the ability to track outbreaks of recently emerged diseases
    like Zika or Ebola, but also routine foodborne illnesses, like
    Salmonella. Without these dollars provided by the Affordable Care
    Act, CDC's ability to protect the health and safety of Americans
    will be dramatically reduced. And our collective ability to address
    the next big public health threat will put us at risk." \[Chrissie

-   **The CDC Said Losing The Fund Would Hamper Its Ability To Prevent
    And Respond To Diseases Like The Flu.** According to CNN, "CDC\'s
    website says losing this funding would cripple officials\' ability
    to detect, prevent and respond to health threats including pandemic
    flu." \[CNN,
