### 2018 Funding

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted For An FY 2019 Defense, Labor, HHS, Education
Conference Report Appropriations Bill And Continuing Resolution Which
Also Made Nearly \$8 Billion For FEMA Funds To Be Used For Hurricane
Florence Recovery.** In September 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for an FY 2019
appropriations bill and continuing resolution. According to
Congressional Quarterly, "The agreement provides FY 2019 appropriations
for two annual spending measures --- Defense and Labor-HHS-Education ---
as well as a continuing resolution to keep all federal departments and
agencies operating through Dec. 7 if they don\'t have full-year
appropriations enacted. Together, the two spending bills provide a total
of \$784.5 billion in discretionary spending subject to budget caps, 63%
of the \$1.244 trillion limit for FY 2019. It provides \$674.4 billion
in net discretionary funding for the Defense Department (\$19.8 billion
more than FY 2018 but \$1.1 billion less than requested), including
\$606.5 billion in base discretionary funding (\$17.0 billion more than
FY 2018) and \$67.9 billion in OCO funding. For Labor-HHS-Education it
provides \$180 billion in discretionary spending, including \$178.1
billion subject to budget caps and \$1.9 billion in program integrity
funding --- \$977 million more than comparable FY 2018 funding and
\$10.7 billion more than requested." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote of 361 to 61. The president later signed the
bill into law. \[House Vote 405,

-   **Bill Made Nearly \$8 Billion Available To Be Spent Towards
    Hurricane Florence Relief.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "By continuing funding for the Homeland Security Department at the
    FY 2018 level, it also makes available \$7.9 billion for the Federal
    Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund that could be
    used for relief and recovery from Hurricane Florence, which hit the
    Carolinas earlier this month. The CR allows that funding to be spent
    at the rate necessary to carry out necessary relief and recovery
    activities." \[Congressional Quarterly,
