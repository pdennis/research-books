# Federal Emergency Management Agency

### Modifying Disaster Mitigation Programs

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Modify FEMA Disaster Mitigation Programs,
Including Increasing The Amount The President May Reserve From The
Disaster Relief Fund For National Public Infrastructure Pre-Disaster
Mitigation Assistance, Allow Private Non-Profit Facilities To Receive
Pre-Hazard Mitigation Funds, And Require FEMA To Provide Grants For
Projects That Would Improve Home Resilience Against Natural Disasters.**
In April 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted
for the Resilient AMERICA Act, which would "modify and expand
requirements related to Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster
mitigation programs. Specifically, it would increase the amount the
president may set aside from the Disaster Relief Fund for national
public infrastructure pre-disaster mitigation assistance from 6 percent
to not more than 15 percent of the funds spent in the previous year on
major disaster declarations. It would authorize private nonprofit
facilities to receive pre-disaster hazard mitigation funds and require
FEMA to use at least 10 percent of funds available for activities to
implement the latest published editions of building codes and
hazard-resistant designs. Among other provisions, it would require FEMA
to carry out a residential resilience pilot program to provide grants to
individuals for projects that increase the resiliency of an existing
home against natural disaster hazards and risks; specify that FEMA must
require construction projects with a cost of at least \$1 million that
receive nonemergency financial assistance to use only U.S.-produced
steel and iron; and require the Government Accountability Office to
conduct a study on the challenges faced by states and territories in
obtaining assistance under prior law." The vote was on passage. The
House passed the bill by a vote of 383-41, thus the bill was sent to the
Senate. \[House Vote 113,

### Wildfire Reimbursement Waiver

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted Against An Amendment That Provided A
Reimbursement Waiver For FEMA Or Federal Land Management Agencies'
Reimbursements To The Defense Department For Military Support In The
Response Of Major Wildfires Or Declared Disasters Or Emergencies.** In
July 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted
against an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2023, which would "waive current law\'s requirement that
FEMA or federal land management agencies reimburse DOD (with civilian
funds) for cost of military support for disaster response to major
wildfires or federally declared disasters/emergencies." The vote was on
the adoption of an amendment. The House rejected the amendment by a vote
195-232. \[House Vote 340,
