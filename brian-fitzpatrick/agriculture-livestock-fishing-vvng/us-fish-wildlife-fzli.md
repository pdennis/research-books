### Foreign Assistance

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Bar The U.S. Fish And Wildlife Service From
Providing Financial Aid To Foreign Security Forces That Have Committed
Human Rights Violations.** In July 2022, according to Congressional
Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for the Advancing Human Rights-Centered
International Conservation Act of 2022, which would "prohibit the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service from providing financial assistance or support
to any unit of a foreign security force if the agency or the State
Department has credible information that the unit has committed a gross
human rights violation, unless the recipient is taking steps to address
and prevent future violations. It would require a number of
administrative procedures to prevent funding for entities disqualified
for funding, including to require the service to establish and
periodically update procedures to identify human rights violators;
incorporate into the terms of agreement for conservation grants that the
recipient will not commit, fund or support human rights violations; and
perform regular audits of funding recipients. It would require
recipients to refer all credible information of human rights violations
in connection with the financial award to the service." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote 379-43, thus the bill was
sent to the Senate. The Senate did not take substantive action on the
bill. \[House Vote 377,

### Lesser Prairie-Chicken Rule

Service Rule That Designated Two Populations Of The Lesser
Prairie-Chicken As "Endangered" And "Threatened" Under The Endangered
Species Act.** In July 2023, according to Congressional Quarterly,
Fitzpatrick voted against a joint resolution that would "provide for
congressional disapproval of the December 2022 U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service rule that established protections for the lesser prairie chicken
under the Endangered Species Act, designating the southern population
segment of the species as 'endangered' and the northern population
segment as 'threatened.' The rule took effect on March 27, 2023. Under
the provisions of the joint resolution, the Fish and Wildlife Service
rule would have no force or effect." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the resolution by a vote of 221 to 206, thus the resolution was

    That Listed Two Populations Of The Lesser Prairie-Chicken, A Grouse
    Species, Under The Endangered Species Act.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "By a vote of 221-206, the House passed a
    measure (S J Res 9) that would repeal the rule finalized by the U.S.
    Fish and Wildlife Service in November listing two populations of the
    lesser prairie-chicken, a species of grouse slightly larger than a
    pigeon, under the law known as the Endangered Species Act. Four
    Democrats joined 217 Republicans to support the measure. One
    Republican --- Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania --- was
    opposed." \[Congressional Quarterly,

-   **The U.S. Fish And Wildlife Service Rule Designated As "Endangered"
    The Southern Population Of The Lesser Prairie-Chicken Native To
    Eastern New Mexico And Western Texas And "Threatened" To The
    Northern Population Native To Colorado, Oklahoma And Texas.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Under the rule, the southern
    population of the lesser prairie-chicken native to eastern New
    Mexico and western Texas was given the higher listing of endangered,
    while the northern population native to portions of Colorado,
    Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas was listed as threatened."

    [7/27/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7804562?8)\]

-   **The U.S. Fish And Wildlife Service Emphasized That The Lesser
    Prairie-Chicken's Population To 32,000 Has Decimated Due To Habitat
    Loss And Fragmentation.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    Fish and Wildlife Service said that the species once possibly
    numbered in the millions, but its numbers have been decimated by
    habitat loss and fragmentation. Aerial surveys conducted from 2012
    through 2022 estimated a five-year average population of just over
    32,000." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [7/27/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7804562?8)\]

    Prairie-Chicken Would Cause Economic Activity In The Species'
    Habitats.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Groups including
    the American Farm Bureau Federation and the Permian Basin Petroleum
    Association expressed concern that extending protections to the
    species would harm economic activity in the birds' habitats."

    [7/27/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7804562?8)\]

-   **Many Lawmakers Opposed The Rule Due To Concerns That It Would Make
    It Harder To Use The Species' Habitat For Other Purposes, Such As
    Farming, Oil And Gas Drilling Or The Construction Of Transmission
    Lines.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "However many have
    opposed listing due to concerns it would make it difficult to use
    its habitat for other purposes. The joint resolution's sponsor, Sen.
    Roger Marshall, R-Kan., said the listing would threaten the
    viability of farming, oil and gas drilling and the construction of
    transmission lines across the five states. He said the service
    should instead look toward voluntary agreements with landowners to
    ensure the bird's survival." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [5/3/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7733600?9)\]

-   **Fossil Fuel And Farming Industries Opposed Listing The Lesser
    Prairie-Chicken On The Endangered List, Arguing It Would Harm The
    Ability For Them To Do Business In Areas Of The Western U.S.**

    candidate for listing for decades. Representatives of the fossil
    fuel and farming industries, however, raised concerns that a listing
    would affect their ability to do business across wide portions of
    the western U.S." \[Congressional Quarterly,

Service Rule That Designated The Northern Long-Eared Bat As "Endangered"
Under The Endangered Species Act.** In July 2023, according to

that would "provide for congressional disapproval of the November 2022
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rule that increased protections for the
northern long-eared bat under the Endangered Species Act, changing its
classification from 'threatened' to 'endangered.' The rule took effect
on Jan. 30, 2023. Under the provisions of the joint resolution, the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service rule would have no force or effect." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the resolution by a vote of 220 to 209,
thus the resolution was sent to the President. \[House Vote 382,

-   **The Rule Upgraded The Northern Long-Eared Bat's Listing As
    "Threatened" To "Endangered."** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The House also passed a joint resolution (S J Res 24)
    that would similarly block a rule upgrading the northern long-eared
    bat's listing from threatened to endangered. Two Democrats --- Henry
    Cuellar of Texas and Jared Golden of Maine --- joined the majority
    Republicans in the 220-209 vote. One Republican --- Fitzpatrick ---
    voted against the resolution." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [7/27/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7804562?8)\]

-   **The Northern Long-Eared Bat Was Designed As Threatened In 2015 Due
    To A Disease Spread Causing White-Nose Syndrome, Which Led To A
    Large Population Decrease.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "The species was first listed as threatened in 2015 due in large
    part to a disease spread by the growth of a nonnative fungus causing
    white-nose syndrome. This has continued to spread in the intervening
    years and caused steep population decline, according to the Fish and
    Wildlife Service." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [7/27/23](https://plus.cq.com/doc/news-7804562?8)\]

-   **May 2023: President Biden Threatened To Veto The Resolution.**

    Potentially Delay Necessary Infrastructure, Despite Infrastructure
    Projects Not Having Much To Do With The Species' Decline.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "Opponents of the bat's
    listing say that increased protections have the potential to delay
    necessary infrastructure, even though these projects have little to
    do with the species' decline." \[Congressional Quarterly,
