# Farm Subsidies

### Conservation Programs

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The House GOP's 2018 Farm Bill, Which
Reauthorized Farm Programs Such As Crop Subsidies, Reauthorized SNAP -
But With New Work Requirements-, And Eliminated The Conservation
Stewardship Program.** In June 2018, Fitzpatrick voted against the House
GOP Farm Bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Passage of the
bill that would reauthorize and extend federal farm and nutrition
programs through fiscal 2023, including crop subsidies, conservation,
rural development and agricultural trade programs and the Supplemental
Nutritional Assistance Program. It would require individuals receiving
SNAP benefits, who are 18-59 years old, to work or participate in work
training programs for a minimum of 20 hours per week, and would require
the Department of Agriculture to establish a database to track
individuals receiving SNAP benefits. The bill would reauthorize and
extend supplemental agricultural disaster assistance programs, the
current sugar policies and loan rates, several international food aid
programs, nonrecourse marketing assistance loans for loan commodities,
several dairy programs, including the dairy risk management program
(previously the margin protection program) and would modify certain
utility standards in the Home Energy Assistance Program to require SNAP
benefits recipients to provide documentation of such expenses in order
to receive increased benefits using the Standard Utility Allowance. The
bill would authorize, with modifications, the farm risk-management
program, which gives agriculture producers a choice of receiving price
loss coverage or agriculture risk coverage, on a
covered-commodity-by-covered-commodity basis, for the 2019 through 2023
crop years. The bill would reauthorize several conservation programs,
and would increase the conservation reserve program from 24 to 29
million acres and reduce from 750,000 to 500,000 acres the cap for
Farmable Wetland Program enrollment. It would also increase the amount
authorized annually for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program for
the 2019 through 2023 crop years, with a maximum authorization of \$3
billion in 2023. It would eliminate the conservation stewardship program
and would also allow the Environmental Protection Agency to determine
whether a pesticide is likely to jeopardize the survival of a federally
designated threatened or endangered species, or the habitat of such a
species, without having to consult with federal agencies." The vote was
on passage. The House adopted the bill by a vote of 213 to 211. A
modified version of the bill was later signed into law. \[House Vote

### Direct Subsidies

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Ending The Biomass And Bioenergy
Subsidy Program.** In May 2018, Fitzpatrick voted against an amendment
that would have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "repeal\[ed\] the
Department of Agriculture biomass and bioenergy subsidy programs." The
underlying legislation was the 2018 House GOP farm bill. The House
rejected the amendment by a vote of 75 to 340. \[House Vote 197,

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating The Agriculture
Risk Coverage Program And The Price Loss Coverage Program.** In October
2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a budget resolution that would in part,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new
budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal
2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap
total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and
would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for
fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to
war or terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of
the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the
Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program.
It would require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the
U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the
budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget
resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281.

-   **Budget Calls For The Eliminating The Agriculture Risk Coverage
    Program And The Price Loss Coverage Program.** According to the
    Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Under current law, the
    taxpayers provide subsidies for wheat, oats, and barley, corn, grain
    sorghum, long grain rice, medium grain rice, dry peas, pulse crops
    (lentils, small chickpeas, large chickpeas), soybeans, other
    oilseeds (sunflower seed, rapeseed, canola, safflower, flaxseed,
    mustard seed, crambe, sesame seed), peanuts, upland cotton,
    extra-long staple cotton, wool, mohair, honey, milk, and sugar. The
    2014 Farm Bill created two new general farm support programs,
    allowing producers to choose their preferred taxpayer-provided
    subsidy: • The Price Loss Coverage (PLC) pays farmers when the
    nationwide average price for a commodity falls below a reference
    price set in law (even if a particular farmer sells his crop for a
    higher price). • The Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) shallow loss
    program pays farmers when revenues fall below their recent levels.
    Unfortunately, these two programs are now estimated to cost almost
    \$20 billion more than originally projected when the programs were
    created in 2014.287 This is just another example of how it is
    impossible for government to accurately predict and control market
    conditions. As described in Farms and Free Enterprise, 'A
    fundamental problem with all commodity programs is that they attempt
    to supplant the natural workings of the marketplace with the wisdom
    of Washington.'288 These commodity subsidy programs are
    unsustainable. Eliminating these programs would save taxpayers more
    than \$50 billion over ten years." \[Republican Study Committee,

-   **Budget Called For Cutting Crop Insurance Subsidies.** According to
    the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "This budget would
    make a modest reform to the crop insurance program by reducing
    subsidies to 40 percent of premium costs and limiting the
    government's reimbursement to crop insurance companies for
    administrative expenses to 9.25 percent of estimated premiums.
    According to the CBO, this would save taxpayers more than \$21
    billion. Over time, the federal government should transition out of
    subsiding crop insurance, and instead allow the free market to meet
    the demand for this financial product." \[Republican Study
