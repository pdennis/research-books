# Farm Bill

### 2018

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The House GOP's 2018 Farm Bill, Which
Reauthorized Farm Programs Such As Crop Subsidies And Reauthorized SNAP
With New Work Requirements.** In May 2018, Fitzpatrick voted against the
House GOP Farm Bill. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Passage of
the bill that would reauthorize and extend federal farm and nutrition
programs through fiscal 2023, including crop subsidies, conservation,
rural development and agricultural trade programs and the Supplemental
Nutritional Assistance Program. It would require individuals receiving
SNAP benefits, who are 18-59 years old, to work or participate in work
training programs for a minimum of 20 hours per week, and would require
the Department of Agriculture to establish a database to track
individuals receiving SNAP benefits. The bill would reauthorize and
extend supplemental agricultural disaster assistance programs, the
current sugar policies and loan rates, several international food aid
programs, nonrecourse marketing assistance loans for loan commodities,
several dairy programs, including the dairy risk management program
(previously the margin protection program) and would modify certain
utility standards in the Home Energy Assistance Program to require SNAP
benefits recipients to provide documentation of such expenses in order
to receive increased benefits using the Standard Utility Allowance. The
bill would authorize, with modifications, the farm risk-management
program, which gives agriculture producers a choice of receiving price
loss coverage or agriculture risk coverage, on a
covered-commodity-by-covered-commodity basis, for the 2019 through 2023
crop years. The bill would reauthorize several conservation programs,
and would increase the conservation reserve program from 24 to 29
million acres and reduce from 750,000 to 500,000 acres the cap for
Farmable Wetland Program enrollment. It would also increase the amount
authorized annually for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program for
the 2019 through 2023 crop years, with a maximum authorization of \$3
billion in 2023. It would eliminate the conservation stewardship program
and would also allow the Environmental Protection Agency to determine
whether a pesticide is likely to jeopardize the survival of a federally
designated threatened or endangered species, or the habitat of such a
species, without having to consult with federal agencies." The vote was
on passage. The House rejected the bill by a vote of 198 to 213. The
House later took a revote several weeks later and passed the bill. A
modified version of the bill was later signed into law. \[House Vote
