**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating Sugar
Subsidies.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a budget
resolution that would in part, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It
would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1
trillion over 10 years. It would cap total discretionary spending at
\$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas
Contingency Operations funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and
would incorporate funding related to war or terror into the base defense
account. It would assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and
would convert Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into
a single block grant program. It would require that off budget programs,
such as Social Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, be included in the budget." The underlying legislation was
an FY 2018 House GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC
budget by a vote of 139 to 281. \[House Vote 555,

-   **Budget Resolution Called For Eliminating Sugar Subsidies.**
    According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget,
    "Eliminate the Sugar Program The federal government's sugar program
    is one of the most egregious examples of crony capitalism and drives
    up costs for consumers. The program consists of both price supports
    and production limits for domestic sugar producers, as well as
    import restrictions and tariffs for imported sugar. Because of these
    restrictions, the price of domestic sugar is about twice that of the
    world market price.289 According to CBO, eliminating the sugar
    program would save \$123 million over ten years. However, the
    savings would be much greater for American consumers, and would come
    with the added benefit of restoring the efficiencies of free
    enterprise, competition, and individual choice to a large US
    market." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed
