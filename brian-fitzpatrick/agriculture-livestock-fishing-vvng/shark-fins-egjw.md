# Shark Fins

### Domestic Sale Ban

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Ban The Domestic Sale Of Shark Fins.** In
December 2022, according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted
for the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2023, which would, in part, "prohibit domestic shark fin sales."
The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 350-80,
thus the bill was sent to the Senate for final concurrence. The Senate
concurred with the House, sent the final bill to President Biden, and it
ultimately became law. \[House Vote 516,
