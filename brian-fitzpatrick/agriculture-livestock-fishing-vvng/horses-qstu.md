### Horse Soring Prevention

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted To Strengthen Regulations And Penalties
Regarding "Horse Soring" Practices By Imposing A New Process To License
Individuals To Detect Horse Soring At Horse Shows Or Sales, Prohibiting
The Use Of Certain Devices For Horse Soring, And Barring Sored Horses
From Being Exhibited For At Least 180 Days.** In November 2022,
according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted for with the
Prevent All Soring Tactics Act of 2022, which would "strengthen federal
regulation of and penalties for 'horse soring' practices, which are
primarily used to accentuate a horse\'s gait and may include the use of
chemicals, pressure and devices that cause pain to horses\' front legs
or hooves. Specifically; it would require the Agriculture Department to
create a new process to license individuals to detect and diagnose horse
soring at horse shows, sales and other events - replacing the
industry\'s current self-regulatory practices. It would prohibit the use
of certain devices and materials used for horse soring and allow the
department to bar sored horses from being shown or exhibited for at
least 180 days for a first offense, at least one year for a second
offense and at least three years for a third offense. It would also
increase from \$3,000 to \$5,000 the maximum fine and increase from one
year to three years the maximum prison sentence for violations of the
1970 Horse Protection Act." The vote was on passage. The House passed
the bill by a vote of 304-111. The Senate did not take substantive
action on the bill. \[House Vote 478,
