# Rural Development

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For The FY 2020 Minibus Appropriations Bill,
Which Provided \$3.2 Billion In Discretionary Funding For USDA Rural
Development Programs.** In December 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for the FY
2020 minibus spending bill, which represented 8 of the 12 appropriations
bills. According to Congressional Quarterly, the bill "provides \$3.2
billion for USDA Rural Development programs, including \$2.1 billion for
rural housing (4% more than FY 2019), \$764 million for rural utilities
and telecommunication (20% more), and \$109 million for rural business
development (6% more). Those funds would support more than \$38 billion
in grants, subsidized loans, and unsubsidized loans --- including \$24
billion for housing, \$1.4 billion for rural water and waste programs,
and \$1.1 billion for rural businesses, as well as \$87 million for
various rural broadband grant and loan programs." The vote was a motion
to concur in the Senate amendment. The House agreed to the motion by a
vote of 297-120. The Senate later passed the bill and the President
signed the bill into law. \[House Vote 689,
