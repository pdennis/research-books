### Hazardous Fuel Procedures And Reporting

**2023: Fitzpatrick Voted For Creating Standardized Data Tracking And
Reporting Procedures Related To Hazardous Fuel Reduction.** In September
2023, Fitzpatrick voted for the Accurately Counting Risk Elimination
Solutions (ACRES) Act that, according to Congressional Quarterly, "would
require the Agriculture and Interior departments, within 90 days of
enactment, to implement standardized procedures for tracking and
reporting data related to their hazardous fuels reduction, or vegetation
management that reduces the risk of wildfire. It would require the
standardized procedures to include regular data accuracy reviews and
verification methods, among other requirements. The bill would require
the departments to include a report on the department's hazardous fuels
reduction activities in the previous fiscal year in the materials
submitted in support of the president's annual budget request. It also
would require the Government Accountability Office, within two years of
enactment, to conduct a study and submit a report to Congress on the
implementation of the bill with respect to the departments' reporting
and tracking of hazardous fuels reduction activities." The vote was on
passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 406 to 4, thus the bill
was sent to the Senate. \[House Vote 386,
