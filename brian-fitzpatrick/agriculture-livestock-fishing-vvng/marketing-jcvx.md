### Agriculture Marketing Orders And Check-Off Programs

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Called For Eliminating The Agriculture
Marketing Orders And Check-Off Programs.** In October 2017, Fitzpatrick
voted against a budget resolution that would in part, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9 trillion in new budget
authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the budget by fiscal 2023 by
reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10 years. It would cap total
discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for fiscal 2018 and would
assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations funding for fiscal
2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate funding related to war or
terror into the base defense account. It would assume repeal of the 2010
health care overhaul and would convert Medicaid and the Children's
Health Insurance Program into a single block grant program. It would
require that off budget programs, such as Social Security, the U.S.
Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be included in the
budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House GOP budget
resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of 139 to 281.

-   **Budget Called For Eliminating The Agriculture Marketing Orders And
    Check-Off Programs.** According to the Republican Study Committee FY
    2018 Budget, "Eliminate Agriculture Marketing Orders and Check-off
    Programs The federal government currently operates 29 marketing
    orders for different fruits, vegetables, and specialty crops. These
    agreements, which date back to the market intrusions of the New
    Deal, allow the government to collude with segments of certain
    industries to restrict the supply of food to consumers. The cartels
    created by the agreement are given tools such as volume controls,
    minimum quality standards, and packaging requirements.293 The USDA
    also operates 22 'Research & Promotion' programs, better known as
    check-off programs. These programs impose a mandatory fee on the
    sale of covered commodities which are used to fund promotional
    activities of the relevant Research & Promotion Program board. The
    result of these arrangements is that producers are taxed using the
    force of government to fund advertising activities they might not
    otherwise be willing to pay for and may not actually benefit from.
    This, in turn, results in increased prices for consumers. Beginning
    in FY 2018, both marketing orders and check-off programs should be
    eliminated." \[Republican Study Committee, [Accessed

-   **Budget Calls For Eliminating The Market Access Program.**
    According to the Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget,
    "Eliminate the Market Access Program (MAP) The Market Access Program
    (MAP) funds oversees marketing and promotion activities for U.S.
    agricultural products and commodities, in partnership with U.S.
    agricultural trade associations, cooperatives, state regional trade
    groups, and small businesses. While this is no doubt helpful to some
    businesses across the country, the federal government has no
    business subsidizing the advertising budgets of corporations. The
    National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform targeted
    this program as one that needs reforms. This budget terminates this
    program in FY 2018, saving almost \$2 billion over ten years."
