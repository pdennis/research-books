### Debt Forgiveness

**2021: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Forgiving Farm Loan Debt For
Economically Distressed Farmers And Ranchers.** In November 2021,
Fitzpatrick voted against the Build Back Better act which would,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide such sums as necessary
for the USDA to forgive farm loan debt for economically distressed
farmers and ranchers." The vote was on passage. The House passed the
bill by a vote of 220-213. \[House Vote 385,
