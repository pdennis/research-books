-   **\$500 Million Would Be Reserved To Pay Certain Producers To
    Implement Crop Nutrient Management Practices Or Precision
    Agriculture Practices, And Modify Existing Conversation Programs To
    Provide Additional Support, Such As Loans, To Farmers And Ranchers
    To Implement Precision Agriculture Practices And Procure
    Technology.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "Within
    supplemental appropriations, it would provide \$500 million for
    additional payments to producers under the Environmental Quality
    Incentives Program to implement crop nutrient management practices
    or precision agriculture practices, which use new technologies to
    increase crop yields or decrease needed inputs such as land,
    fertilizer and herbicides. It would also modify existing USDA
    conservation programs to provide additional support, including loans
    and loan guarantees, for farmers and ranchers to adopt precision
    agriculture practices and acquire related technology."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/16/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/277?6)\]

-   **The Bill Would Authorize \$120 Million Annually Through FY 2025
    For Agriculture Department Loans, Loan Guarantees And Grants For
    Public And Private Entities To Expand Livestock Capacities And
    Promote Local And Interstate Sales.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "The bill would also authorize \$120 million annually
    through fiscal 2025 for USDA loans, loan guarantees and grants for
    public and private entities to expand and diversify livestock or
    poultry processing capabilities and promote local and interstate
    sales by meeting relevant regulatory standards." \[Congressional
    Quarterly, [6/16/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/277?6)\]

-   **The Bill Would Create A Special Investigator's Office In The
    Agriculture Department To Prosecute Violations Of Competition And
    Trade Practices By Packers And Poultry Dealers.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "It would establish a USDA special
    investigator's office to investigate and prosecute violations of
    competition and trade practices by packers and live poultry dealers
    and consult with the Homeland Security Department on security issues
    in the food and agriculture sector." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/16/22](https://plus.cq.com/vote/2022/H/277?6)\]

    Establish At Least Six Supply Chain Regional Resource Centers, And
    Establishing A Temporary Task Force On Food System Supply Chain
    Resilience And Crisis Response.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "To address supply chain issues, it would authorize \$100
    million for grants, loans and other assistance to address fertilizer
    shortages, including by reducing dependence on foreign sources and
    supporting efficient and sustainable fertilizer use; direct the USDA
    to establish at least six Supply Chain Regional Resource Centers to

    challenges; and require the USDA to establish a temporary food
    system supply chain resilience and crisis response task force."

-   **The Provision That Would Establish A Special Agriculture
    Department Investigator Was A Bipartisan Effort To Address The
    Monopolies In The Beef Market, In Which Four Companies Control Over
    80% Of Beef Processing, But There Was Disagreement Over The Need For
    Federal Action.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The House
    voted 221-204 to send to the Senate a legislative package (HR 7606)
    that incorporated a bill by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., that
    would set up a special Agriculture Department investigator with
    subpoena powers and the ability to file civil lawsuits or take
    administrative actions against violations of the Packers and
    Stockyards Act of 1921 by meatpacking companies and live poultry
    dealers. The bill would establish an Office of the Special
    Investigator for Competition Matters. The investigator bill is part
    of a bipartisan effort in the House and Senate to address
    consolidation of the beef market in which four companies control
    more than 80 percent of the processing. But there is broader
    disagreement in agriculture and in Congress about the need for
    federal action and the scope of such action." \[Congressional
