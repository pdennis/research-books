### Coin Metal Modifications

**2020: Fitzpatrick Voted For The Coin Metal Modification Authorization
And Costs Savings Act Of 2020 To Permit The U.S. Mint To Modify The
Composition Of Circulating Coins If The Modification Will Reduce
Taxpayer Costs.** In December 2020, Fitzpatrick voted for suspending the
rules and pass the Coin Metal Modification Authorization and Cost
Savings Act of 2020 which would, according to Congressional Quarterly,
"authorize the U.S. Mint to modify the metallic composition of
circulating coins if a study indicates that the modification will reduce
taxpayer costs; will not change the size, weight or compatibility with
most coin acceptors of current coinage; and will have minimal impacts on
the public and stakeholders. It would require the Mint to notify
Congress 90 days prior to making a modification and halt the
modification if Congress finds that it is unjustified and enacts
disapproving legislation." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules
and pass the bill. The House agreed to the motion by a vote of 343-41.
