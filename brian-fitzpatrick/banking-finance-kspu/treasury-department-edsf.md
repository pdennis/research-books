-   **The FY 2020 Minibus Provided \$11.5 Billion For The IRS And
    Continued Several Provisions Restricting IRS Activities.** According
    to Congressional Quarterly. "The bill provides \$11.5 billion for
    the IRS in FY 2020 --- 2% more than FY 2019. It continues a number
    of provisions restricting IRS activities, including prohibitions
    against the targeting of groups for regulatory scrutiny based on
    their ideological belief or individuals for exercising their First
    Amendment rights, and prohibitions against the payment of bonuses to
    IRS employees or hiring former employees unless their conduct and
    tax compliance has been considered. It ends a long-standing
    prohibition against the use of pre-populated tax returns by the
    IRS." \[Congressional Quarterly,
