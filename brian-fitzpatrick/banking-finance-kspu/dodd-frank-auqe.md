# Dodd-Frank

### Cardin-Lugar

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Disapproving The Cardin-Lugar Rule,
Which Required That Oil, Gas And Mineral Extraction Public Companies
Publish Payments To Foreign Countries Where They Operate.** In February
2017, Fitzpatrick voted against disapproving the Cardin-Lugar Rule via
the Congressional Review Act. According to Congressional Quarterly,
"This resolution disapproves the rule issued by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 27, 2016, known as the Disclosure of
Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers Rule, that requires resource
extraction issuers to provide detailed, public reporting of all payments
to governments that equal or exceed \$100,000 per project annually." The
vote was on the legislation. The House agreed to the legislation by a
vote of 235 to 187. The Senate then passed the resolution, which the
president later signed the into law. \[House Vote 72,

-   **The SEC Created A Rule In June 2016 That Required "Foreign And
    Domestic Companies Listed On U.S. Stock Exchanges And Involved In
    Oil, Gas And Mineral Resource Extraction Must Publish The
    Project-Level Payments They Make To Foreign Countries In Which They
    Operate."** According to a press release from Sen. Ben Cardin
    (D-MD), "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled
    Monday that all foreign and domestic companies listed on U.S. stock
    exchanges and involved in oil, gas and mineral resource extraction
    must publish the project-level payments they make to foreign
    countries in which they operate. The rule implements Section 1504 of
    the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a
    provision authored by U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Richard
    Lugar (R-Ind.) in 2010. America led the international community in
    promoting transparency in the extractive industry by adopting
    Cardin-Lugar six years ago, but delays by the SEC and a spurious
    court challenge by the oil and gas industry have allowed other
    countries to surpass the United States." \[Sen. Cardin Press
    Release,
    [6/27/16](https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sec-issues-final-rule-on-cardin-lugar-effort-to-increase-transparency-in-us-extractive-industries-)\]

-   **Purpose Of The Rule Was In Part To Fight Global Corruption.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street
    Reform and Consumer Protection Act (PL 111-203) directs the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to develop rules that
    require companies that extract oil, natural gas or other minerals
    and that are registered in the United States to disclose certain
    payments to foreign governments or to the U.S. federal government.
    The provision in the law was meant 'to support global efforts to
    improve the transparency of payments made in the extractive
    industries in order to combat global corruption and promote
    accountability.'" \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [1/27/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5029348/29?129)\]

-   **Republican Rule Opponents Argue, In Part, That The Rule May Put
    Resource Extraction Issuers (REIs) At Risk By Forcing Disclosure Of
    Information That The Host Nation Prohibits.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "Supporters of the resolution, primarily
    Republicans, argue that the rule puts REIs at risk because it may
    require them to disclose information that the host nation of their
    project prohibits from disclosure or is commercially sensitive. They
    argue that oil and natural gas companies in the U.S. are already
    leading the push for transparency in payments to foreign governments
    and do not require an inflexible rule to force them to do so. They
    also point to the extractive industries transparency initiative, a
    voluntary international transparency program, as a better, more
    realistic alternative to the rule." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [1/27/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5029348/29?129)\]

-   **Rule Was In Part Designed To Combat Bribery.** According to The
    Atlantic, "The final bill included a measure, co-sponsored by
    Senators Ben Cardin and Richard Lugar, requiring that all oil, gas,
    and mineral companies on the U.S. stock exchange disclose any
    payments they make to foreign governments for licenses or permits
    for development. It aimed to curb bribery and give poor countries
    rich in resources a chance to hold their governments and
    resource-extraction companies accountable. After years of delay, on
    June 27, 2016, the Securities Exchange Commission published a final
    version of the rule that enforces Cardin-Lugar. It was set to go
    into effect in 2018." \[The Atlantic,
    [2/1/17](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/02/exxon-mobil-tillerson-state-corruption-russia-sec/515244/)\]

-   **The Hill: Senate Votes To Repeal Transparency Rule For Oil
    Companies.** According to The Hill, "Senate votes to repeal
    transparency rule for oil companies. The Senate voted strictly along
    party lines Friday morning to repeal a regulation requiring
    disclosures for the payments that energy companies make to foreign
    governments. The measure passed 52-47 in a pre-dawn vote. The
    Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) foreign payments rule was
    mandated by a key provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform
    bill and was meant to reduce corruption in resource-rich countries
    by detailing the royalties and other payments that oil, natural gas,
    coal and mineral companies make to governments." \[The Hill,

    to this rule that the target is a) invested in b) has received
    campaign donations from. \[Congressional Quarterly,

### Partial Repeal

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted To Raise The Threshold Set By Dodd-Frank Where
A Bank Is Deemed Large Enough That If It Failed, It Would Cause
Significant Economic Harm.** In May 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for a bill
that increased the asset threshold for financial institutions to \$250
billion for when they were subject to more stringent financial
regulations. According to Congressional Quarterly, "Passage of the bill
that would apply the more stringent bank regulation provisions of the
2010 financial overhaul to banks with \$250 billion in assets, instead
of those with at least \$50 billion in assets. It would also allow banks
with less than \$10 billion in assets to trade with depositors' money.
The bill would lift the threshold for disclosure requirements to \$10
million for employee-owned securities and would allow venture capital
funds to have up to 250 investors and be exempt from certain registering
requirements. It would provide consumers with the right to request a
'security freeze' on their credit reports, which would prohibit a
consumer reporting agency from releasing information from the consumer's
credit report without express authorization. It would define a
'qualified mortgage' as any residential mortgage loan held by a bank,
removing the requirement that for a 'qualified mortgage,' a bank must
determine that a mortgage recipient has the ability to repay." The vote
was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 258 to 159. The
bill was later signed into law by the president. \[House Vote 216,

Actions, [S.

-   **The Legislation Divided Democrats.** According to the AP, "The
    Republican-led legislation, pushed by Wall Street banks as well as
    regional banks and smaller institutions, garnered some votes from
    House Democrats. Similarly, the bill splintered Democrats into two
    camps when the Senate voted 67-31 to approve it in March."
    \[Associated Press via the PBS,
    [5/22/18](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/house-oks-bill-rolling-back-landmark-dodd-frank-banking-rules)\]

-   **The Bill Was Ostensibly Aimed At Helping Small Banks.** According
    to the AP, "The legislation is aimed at especially helping small and
    medium-sized banks, including community banks and credit unions. But
    critics argue that the likelihood of future taxpayer bailouts will
    be greater once it becomes law. They point to increases in banks'
    lending and profits since Dodd-Frank's enactment in 2010 as
    debunking the assertion that excessive regulation of the banking
    industry is stifling growth." \[Associated Press via the PBS,
    [5/22/18](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/house-oks-bill-rolling-back-landmark-dodd-frank-banking-rules)\]

-   **Legislation Increased The Threshold For Increased Regulation Five
    Times Higher Than Dodd-Frank Created; Banks That Would No Longer Be
    Subject Included BB&T Corp., SunTrust Banks, Fifth Third Bancorp and
    American Express.** According to the AP, "The bill makes a fivefold
    increase, to \$250 billion, in the level of assets at which banks
    are deemed to pose a potential threat if they fail. The change would
    ease regulations and oversight on more than two dozen financial
    institutions, including BB&T Corp., SunTrust Banks, Fifth Third
    Bancorp and American Express." \[Associated Press via the PBS,
    [5/22/18](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/house-oks-bill-rolling-back-landmark-dodd-frank-banking-rules)\]

-   **Bank's Net Income Increased 27.5 Percent Since 2017.** According
    to the AP, "U.S. banks' net income climbed to \$56 billion in the
    January-March quarter, a 27.5 percent increase from a year earlier,
    as profits were revved up by the corporate tax cuts enacted late
    last year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. reported Tuesday."
    \[Associated Press via the PBS,
    [5/22/18](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/house-oks-bill-rolling-back-landmark-dodd-frank-banking-rules)\]

-   **Bill Also Exempted Certain Banks And Credit Unions From Being
    Forced To Report Certain Mortgage Loan Data.** According to the AP,
    "The legislation also exempts certain banks and credit unions from
    requirements to report some mortgage loan data. The exempted data
    includes the age of a loan applicant, credit score, total loan costs
    and interest rate. Critics say that would make it easier for banks
    to discriminate against minorities seeking home mortgages and go
    undetected." \[Associated Press via the PBS,
    [5/22/18](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/house-oks-bill-rolling-back-landmark-dodd-frank-banking-rules)\]

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted Against The FY 2018 Republican Study Committee
Budget Resolution Which In Part Significantly Reformed Dodd-Frank.** In
October 2017, Fitzpatrick voted against a budget resolution that would
in part, according to Congressional Quarterly, "provide for \$2.9
trillion in new budget authority in fiscal 2018. It would balance the
budget by fiscal 2023 by reducing spending by \$10.1 trillion over 10
years. It would cap total discretionary spending at \$1.06 trillion for
fiscal 2018 and would assume no separate Overseas Contingency Operations
funding for fiscal 2018 or subsequent years and would incorporate
funding related to war or terror into the base defense account. It would
assume repeal of the 2010 health care overhaul and would convert
Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program into a single block
grant program. It would require that off budget programs, such as Social
Security, the U.S. Postal Service, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, be
included in the budget." The underlying legislation was an FY 2018 House
GOP budget resolution. The House rejected the RSC budget by a vote of
139 to 281. \[House Vote 555,

-   **Legislation Included The Financial Choice Act, Which Significantly
    Reformed Dodd-Frank By Including The Financial Choice Act Which
    Among Other Things, Repealed The Volcker Rule.** According to the
    Republican Study Committee FY 2018 Budget, "Republicans in Congress
    have long fought to claw back the burdensome requirements of the
    Dodd- Frank Act. While reform may come slowly, the RSC budget is
    committed to rolling back the onerous provisions of the disastrous
    law. The RSC budget includes Chairman Jeb Hensarling's Financial
    CHOICE Act, which would serve as a big first step in ridding America
    of some of Dodd Frank's strictest requirements.94 It would eliminate
    the Treasury Office of Financial Research and remove stricter
    oversight over systemically important financial institutions. It
    would also remove the government's ability to fully dismantle and
    bailout a failing bank. The legislation would make it easier for
    small banks to once again lend to their communities by alleviating
    some of the restrictions Dodd-Frank forced upon them and would
    eliminate the exceedingly complicated Volcker Rule that limits the
    investments that financial firms are able to hold.95 Finally, the
    legislation would deter firms from engaging in illegal or reckless
    activities by imposing stricter penalties against bad actors. The
    House passed the Financial CHOICE Act in June 2017, but it has not
    yet been voted on in the Senate. The Senate should pass this
    legislation and send it to the President to be signed into Law."

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For Legislation That Would Have Repealed
Significant Portions Of Dodd-Frank.** In June 2017, Fitzpatrick voted
for the Financial Choice Act. According to NPR, "House Republicans voted
Thursday to deliver on their promise to repeal Dodd-Frank --- the
massive set of Wall Street regulations President Barack Obama signed
into law after the 2008 financial crisis. In a near party-line vote, the
House approved a bill, dubbed the Financial Choice Act, which scales
back or eliminates many of the post-crisis banking rules." The vote was
on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 233 to 186. The
Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 299,

-   **Dodd-Frank Was Enacted As A Result Of The Great Recession;
    Legislation Would Reduce Scrutiny For Big Banks.** According to the
    Washington Post, "The Republican-led House on Thursday voted to free
    Wall Street from many of the constraints put in place after the 2008
    financial crisis, the opening salvo in what is likely to be a
    protracted battle over deregulation of the powerful banking
    industry. Big banks, from Goldman Sachs to Bank of America, would
    face less scrutiny, and other large financial institutions, such as
    insurance giant MetLife, could escape tougher rules allaltogether
    \[sic\] under the legislation approved largely along party lines."
    \[Washington Post,
    [6/9/17](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/08/house-to-vote-on-sweeping-rollback-of-banking-rules/?utm_term=.d1856503c15f)\]

-   **Legislation Exempted Banks From A Large Number Of Financial
    Regulations If The Bank Increased Its Capital, But Some Big Banks,
    Such As JP Morgan Are Not Expected To Do.** According to the
    Washington Post, "The newly approved legislation would attempt to
    ease the burden on the country's nearly 6,000 banks by offering them
    a choice: If they want to avoid many of the regulatory barriers
    imposed during the Obama administration, they would have to
    significantly increase their emergency financial surpluses. That
    way, if they run into financial trouble, the banks would be more
    likely to survive without taxpayers' help, supporters of the bill
    say. \[...\] For many of the country's largest banks, building the
    bigger financial cushion called for under the bill would be
    expensive. ­JPMorgan Chase would need to set aside an additional
    \$107 billion to take advantage of that option, according to
    research by Nomura, a global investment bank. Goldman Sachs and Bank
    of America would need to set aside an additional \$45 billion and
    \$82 billion, respectively." \[Washington Post,
    [6/9/17](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/08/house-to-vote-on-sweeping-rollback-of-banking-rules/?utm_term=.d1856503c15f)\]

-   **Capital Requirement Would Be A Ten Percent Capital Ratio.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill includes numerous
    provisions intended to reduce the regulation of banks and financial
    service companies, and it establishes a new regulatory regime under
    which banks that maintain at least 10% capital ratio as a financial
    buffer would no longer be subject to numerous regulatory
    requirements." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/7/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5116571?4)\]

-   **Legislation Significantly Reduced The Authority Of The Consumer
    Finance Protection Bureau.** According to Vox, "The Choice Act would
    also gut the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, the brainchild of
    Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). As Mike Konczal wrote for Vox, the
    CFPB has won millions from big corporations by suing those who use
    'deceptive practices' for their customers." \[Vox,
    [6/8/17](https://www.vox.com/2017/6/8/15762462/wall-street-house-republicans)\]

-   **Legislation Allowed The President To Fire The Head Of The CFPB And
    The FHFA For Any Reason.** According to CNN, "Hensarling's bill
    would give the president the power to fire the heads of the Consumer
    Financial Protection Bureau, a consumer watchdog agency created
    under Dodd-Frank, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which
    oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, at any time for
    any \-- or no \-- reason." \[CNN,
    [6/8/17](http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/08/news/economy/house-dodd-frank-repeal/index.html)\]

-   **Legislation Removed The CFPB's Ability To Monitor Financial Firms
    Closely For Consumer Protections And From Writing Payday and
    Car-Title Loan Rules.** According to the Los Angeles Times, "The
    Financial Choice Act would strip the agency of its ability to
    closely monitor financial firms for compliance with consumer
    protection laws and specifically prohibits the bureau from writing
    any regulations on payday and car-title loans." \[Los Angeles Times,
    [6/8/17](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-dodd-frank-repeal-20170608-story.html)\]

-   **Legislation Renamed The CFPB To The Consumer Law Enforcement
    Agency And Subjected The Agency To The Congressional Appropriations
    Process.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The measure
    significantly modifies the structure and authority of the CFPB,
    converting it into an executive agency funded by annual
    appropriations, rather than an independent agency funded directly
    from the Fed, and it makes the agency\'s director subject to removal
    by the president 'at will' (rather than for cause, as under current
    law). \[...\] The CFPB would be renamed as the Consumer Law
    Enforcement Agency (CLEA)." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/7/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5116571?4)\]

-   **CFPB Fined Wells Fargo \$100 Million In 2016 For Deceptive
    Practices; Legislation Would No Longer Allow The CFPB To Do So In
    The Future.** According to the Washington Post, "Hensarling's bill
    would strip the agency of some of its most important powers. It
    would no longer be able to write major rules regulating consumer
    financial companies, such as debt collectors, without getting
    approval from Congress. The agency would lose some of its
    independence because its director would serve at the pleasure of the
    president. And it would also no longer be able to levy hefty fines
    against financial institutions for 'unfair' or 'deceptive'
    practices. The CFPB used those powers to fine Wells Fargo \$100
    million last year for opening up to 2 million accounts customers did
    not ask for or know about." \[Washington Post,
    [6/9/17](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/08/house-to-vote-on-sweeping-rollback-of-banking-rules/?utm_term=.d1856503c15f)\]

-   **Legislation Repealed The Fiduciary Rule.** According to the Los
    Angeles Times, "The bill also would repeal a new Labor Department
    regulation, largely still pending, that requires investment brokers
    who handle retirement funds to put their clients' interests ahead of
    their own compensation, company profits or other factors." \[Los
    Angeles Times,
    [6/8/17](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-dodd-frank-repeal-20170608-story.html)\]

-   **The Volker Rule, Which The Legislation Repealed, Prevented Banks
    That Have Federally Insured Depositors From Using Their Own Money
    For Proprietary Trading And Thus Prevent Banks From Repeating Some
    Of The Mistakes That Lead To The Great Recession.** According to
    Congressional Quarterly, "The measure repeals the Volcker rule
    included in Dodd-Frank, which prohibits banks that hold the funds of
    federally-insured depositors from using their own funds for
    proprietary trading to increase their own profits, or from
    maintaining certain relationships with 'risky' hedge funds and
    private equity funds. The goal of the Volcker Rule is to prevent
    banks from making the types of speculative investments that
    contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. Critics, however, say the
    rule does not actually address any of the problems that led to the
    financial crisis and that it is unwieldy and essentially unworkable,
    while supporters of the rule say it is needed to prevent banks from
    gambling with the taxpayer-backed funds of depositors."
    \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/7/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5116571?4)\]

-   **Legislation Repealed A Rule Requiring Credit Rating Groups Confirm
    That Their Procedures Are Valid.** According to Congressional
    Quarterly, "It also repeals a requirement that national credit
    rating agencies attest to internal controls over the processes used
    for determining credit ratings." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/7/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5116571?0)\]

-   **Legislation Repealed A Rule Requiring Companies Release A
    Comparison Between Its CEO And Its Average Employee.** According to
    the Washington Post, "The bill would also eliminate rules meant to
    rein in Wall Street pay and force companies to release how much
    chief executives earn compared with their average employees, a
    potentially embarrassing disclosure." \[Washington Post,
    [6/9/17](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/08/house-to-vote-on-sweeping-rollback-of-banking-rules/?utm_term=.d1856503c15f)\]

-   **Legislation Repealed The "Orderly Liquidation Process" For Firms,
    Instead Requiring Them To Go Bankrupt.** According to the Washington
    Post, "Under the legislation, failing financial firms would be
    forced to go through the bankruptcy process rather than the 'orderly
    liquidation process' run by regulators under Dodd-Frank."
    \[Washington Post,
    [6/9/17](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/08/house-to-vote-on-sweeping-rollback-of-banking-rules/?utm_term=.d1856503c15f)\]

-   **Orderly Liquidation Was Designed To Prevent A Firms Collapse From
    Spreading.** According to Vox, "Hensarling isn't just making this
    stuff up: His bill would get rid of what's called the Orderly
    Liquidation Authority, a key part of Dodd-Frank that controls what
    happens when financial firms that could sink the whole economy go
    belly-up. Under OLA, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation can
    step in during a panic to immediately take control of the bank. So
    if JPMorgan is on the verge of going bankrupt, the federal
    government can declare an emergency and essentially take control of
    it overnight, to make sure its collapse doesn't spread throughout
    the financial sector. Having a bank go through OLA --- which has
    never happened, since we haven't had a real bank panic since
    Dodd-Frank was passed --- also ensures that the emergency funding
    doesn't come from taxpayers, since the law requires other financial
    firms with a stake in the failing bank to pay back the costs. OLA
    also allows the government to immediately fire all of the bank's
    managers and forces its employees to pay back bonuses." \[Vox,
    [6/8/17](https://www.vox.com/2017/6/8/15762462/wall-street-house-republicans)\]

-   **Legislation Removed The FSOC's Ability To Label Non-Banks
    Systemically Important, Which Subjected Those Firms To Stricter
    Regulation.** According to the Washington Post, "The legislation
    would also strip power from the Financial Stability Oversight
    Council, an interagency group now led by Mnuchin, to label financial
    firms that are not banks, such as MetLife, 'too big to fail' and
    subject them to tougher regulatory oversight." \[Washington Post,
    [6/9/17](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/08/house-to-vote-on-sweeping-rollback-of-banking-rules/?utm_term=.d1856503c15f)\]

-   **Legislation Required The Federal Reserve Create A Mathematical
    Formula To Dictate Policy.** According to Congressional Quarterly,
    "The bill requires the FOMC to develop a mathematical rule --- the
    Directive Policy Rule (DPR) --- to direct its decision making on
    monetary policy to achieve its dual mandate. The DPR must provide a
    strategy to achieve specified goals, identifying which interest rate
    is targeted and describing the strategy for systematic adjustment of
    the target through response to changes in inflation, estimates of
    GDP, estimates of the monetary aggregate and any other variable that
    the FOMC determines to be relevant. The DPR must state whether
    variables used are historical, current or a forecast and must
    include the method of calculating the variable. It must include a
    mathematical function and a formula that predicts a range of future
    values for the targeted interest rate based on changes to inflation,
    GDP, the monetary aggregate and the other relevant variables, and
    describe how bank reserves will be adjusted to achieve the target
    interest rate. It must also include a calculation that describes
    with mathematical precision the expected annual inflation rate over
    a five-year period." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/7/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5116571?0)\]

-   **Legislation Reduced The Number Of "Stress Tests" On Large Banks.**
    According to Congressional Quarterly, "The bill directs the Fed to
    reduce the frequency of 'stress tests' it conducts on banks with
    assets of \$50 billion or more to determine whether the banks have
    sufficient capital to continue operations in times of economic and
    financial stress --- providing that such tests be conducted every
    two years rather than annually." \[Congressional Quarterly,
    [6/7/17](http://www.cq.com/doc/har-5116571?0)\]

-   **The Financial Services Roundtable Supported The Legislation.**
    According to the Washington Post, "The Financial Services
    Roundtable, an industry lobbying group, cheered the bill's passage,
    saying it would 'modernize the financial regulatory system to
    advance the goal of boosting the economy without sacrificing
    important consumer and taxpayer protections.'" \[Washington Post,

    Dodd-Frank Was Enacted.** According to the Los Angeles Times,
    "Democrats said that bank profits are up and lending has increased
    since Dodd-Frank was enacted. Bank profits hit a record \$171
    billion in 2016, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
    And in the first quarter of this year, profits were up 13% from a
    year earlier, the FDIC said." \[Los Angeles Times,

    Rolling Back Oversight In A Way That Could Dramatically Exacerbate
    The Likelihood Of Another Financial Crisis, According To Experts In
    Financial Regulation."** According to Vox, "Spearheaded by House
    Finance Chair Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-TX), the Choice Act begins by
    throwing out much of the banking oversight passed under President
    Barack Obama's administration, mostly through the Dodd-Frank Act
    signed in 2010. But it goes further than that, rolling back
    oversight in a way that could dramatically exacerbate the likelihood
    of another financial crisis, according to experts in financial
    regulation. 'It's a little hard to get your mind around everything
    this bill does, because there's almost no area of financial
    regulation it doesn't touch,' says Marcus Stanley, policy director
    for Americans for Financial Reform. 'There's a bunch of very radical
    stuff in this bill, and it goes way beyond repealing Dodd-Frank.'"

### Stress Tests

**2018: Fitzpatrick Voted To Reduce To Every Two Years -- Down From
Every Year -- For How Often The Fed Conducts "Dodd-Frank" Stress
Tests.** In April 2018, Fitzpatrick voted for legislation that would
have, according to Congressional Quarterly, "reduce\[d\] from twice a
year to once a year the requirement that the Federal Reserve conduct
Dodd-Frank stress tests of financial institutions, and it reduces from
three to two the sets of stress conditions under which banks must be
evaluated by removing the requirement that entities be evaluated under
the adverse conditions scenario. It also prohibit\[ed\] the Federal
Reserve, when carrying out the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
(CCAR) test, from objecting to a company's capital plan on the basis of
qualitative deficiencies in that company's capital planning process.
(CCAR is comprised of a qualitative assessment of a bank's capital
planning processes and a quantitative assessment of the bank's ability
to maintain sufficient capital to continue operations under stress.)"
The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 245 to
174. The Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House

### Systemically Important Financial Institutions

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For Legislation That Would Have Repealed
Significant Portions Of Dodd-Frank, Including The Ability Of The
Financial Stability Oversight Council To Declare Non-Banks As
Systemically Important.** In June 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for the
Financial Choice Act. According to NPR, "House Republicans voted
Thursday to deliver on their promise to repeal Dodd-Frank --- the
massive set of Wall Street regulations President Barack Obama signed
into law after the 2008 financial crisis. In a near party-line vote, the
House approved a bill, dubbed the Financial Choice Act, which scales
back or eliminates many of the post-crisis banking rules." The vote was
on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote of 233 to 186. The
Senate took no substantive action on the legislation. \[House Vote 299,

-   **Legislation Removed The FSOC's Ability To Label Non-Banks
    Systemically Important.** According to the Washington Post, "The
    legislation would also strip power from the Financial Stability
    Oversight Council, an interagency group now led by Mnuchin, to label
    financial firms that are not banks, such as MetLife, 'too big to
    fail' and subject them to tougher regulatory oversight."
