### Volcker Rule

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For Legislation That Would Have Repealed
Significant Portions Of Dodd-Frank, Including Repealing The Volcker
Rule.** In June 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for the Financial Choice Act.
According to NPR, "House Republicans voted Thursday to deliver on their
promise to repeal Dodd-Frank --- the massive set of Wall Street
regulations President Barack Obama signed into law after the 2008
financial crisis. In a near party-line vote, the House approved a bill,
dubbed the Financial Choice Act, which scales back or eliminates many of
the post-crisis banking rules. \[...\] Hensarling's nearly 600-page bill
would defang Dodd-Frank by repealing the so-called Volcker Rule, which
prevents government-insured banks from making risky bets with
investments." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a
vote of 233 to 186. The Senate took no substantive action on the
legislation. \[House Vote 299,

-   **The Volker Rule Prevented Banks That Have Federally Insured
    Depositors From Using Their Own Money For Proprietary Trading And
    Thus Preventing Banks From Repeating Some Of The Mistakes That Lead
    To The Great Recession.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "The
    measure repeals the Volcker rule included in Dodd-Frank, which
    prohibits banks that hold the funds of federally-insured depositors
    from using their own funds for proprietary trading to increase their
    own profits, or from maintaining certain relationships with 'risky'
    hedge funds and private equity funds. The goal of the Volcker Rule
    is to prevent banks from making the types of speculative investments
    that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. Critics, however, say
    the rule does not actually address any of the problems that led to
    the financial crisis and that it is unwieldy and essentially
    unworkable, while supporters of the rule say it is needed to prevent
    banks from gambling with the taxpayer-backed funds of depositors."

-   **Repealing The Volker Rule Would Increase Large Banking Intuitions
    Profits By More Than \$2 Billion In 2018.** According to the
    Washington Post, "The Volcker Rule, which restricts big banks'
    ability to make certain risky financial bets, would be repealed.
    Doing away with that provision alone could boost profits at big
    banks by more than \$2 billion next year, according to Nomura."
