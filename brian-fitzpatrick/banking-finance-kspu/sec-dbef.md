# Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC)

### Disclosure Forms

**2020: Fitzpatrick Voted For Requiring Public Companies To Disclose
Their Ties To Forced Labor Camps In China's Xinjiang.** In September
2020, Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that would, according to
Congressional Quarterly, "require publicly traded companies to disclose
information to the Securities and Exchange Commission on their supply
chains with regard to any goods sourced from the Xinjiang Uighur
autonomous region of China. Specifically, it would require the SEC to
issue rules, within 180 days of enactment, requiring security issuers
filing annual reports or proxy statements to disclose whether the
issuer, or any affiliate, engaged with another entity to import
manufactured goods \-- including electronics, food products, textiles,
shoes and teas \-- that originated in or contain materials sourced in
the Xinjiang region and whether any such goods originated in forced
labor camps. It would also require companies that imported such goods to
disclose the extent of the commercial activity, gross revenue, and net
profits related to the goods and whether they intend to continue
importing the goods. It would require the SEC to make such disclosed
information available on its public website and submit an annual report
to Congress on compliance." The vote was on passage. The House passed
the bill by a vote of 253-163. The Senate did not take substantive
action on the bill. \[House Vote 210,

### Funding

**2022: Fitzpatrick Voted Against Appropriating \$2.2 Billion To The
Securities And Exchange Commission For FY 2023.** In July 2022,
according to Congressional Quarterly, Fitzpatrick voted against the
Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act, 2023, which would "provide \$2.2 billion for the
Securities and Exchange Commission." The vote was on passage. The House
passed the bill by a vote 220-207, thus the bill was sent to the Senate.
The Senate did not take substantive action on the legislation. Congress
passed and signed into law the FY 2023 Budget through H.R. 2617. \[House

### Regulation And Reform

**2019: Fitzpatrick Voted For Limiting The SEC's Ability To Claw Back
Ill-Gotten Gains From Securities Law Violators.** In November 2019,
Fitzpatrick voted for a bill that would, according to Congressional
Quarterly, "modify the statute of limitations applied to Securities and
Exchange Commission disgorgement cases seeking the return of illicit
funds gained in violation of securities law. Specifically, it would
establish a 14-year statute of limitations for such cases, as well as
for relief sought by the SEC through injunctions. The bill would also
require the SEC to submit a report to Congress on enforcement actions
brought by the SEC in the ten years after enactment." The vote was a
motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The House agreed to the
motion and passed the bill by a vote of 314-95. The bill was never taken
up in the Senate. \[House Vote 627,

In Relation To Securities Law.** In July 2019, Fitzpatrick voted for a
bill that would, according to Congressional Quarterly, "expand the
definition of 'whistleblower' in relation to securities law to include
individuals who report potential misconduct regarding securities law to
their employer or another employee within their company -- including
individuals who do not notify the Securities and Exchange Commission of
such misconduct." The vote was on a motion to suspend the rules and pass
the bill. The House agreed to the motion and passed the bill by a vote
of 410-12. \[House Vote 431,
