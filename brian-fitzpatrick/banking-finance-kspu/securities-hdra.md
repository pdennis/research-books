### Regulations

**2024: Fitzpatrick Voted To Exempt Startups And Small Companies From
Securities Regulations.** In March 2024, Fitzpatrick voted for ,
according to Congressional Quarterly, "the bill, as amended, that would
increase participation in capital markets by smaller firms and
investors, by creating exemptions to securities laws and regulations for
startups and other small companies seeking to issue securities on public
exchanges. It would relax certain registration and reporting
requirements for companies, limit the application of various disclosure
requirements, exempt financial advisers or brokers that deal with
smaller stock offerings from registration requirements and modify the
criteria for existing exemptions for small issuers so more companies can
qualify." The vote was on passage. The House passed the bill by a vote
of 212 to 205. \[House Vote 78,

-   **Democrats Argued The Bill Would Make It Easier For Financial
    Middlemen To Sell High-Risk Securities To Investors Without Adequate
    Information.** According to Congressional Quarterly, "House
    Financial Services ranking Democrat Maxine Waters of California
    labeled the bill the 'Access to Fraud Act.' 'This bill makes it
    easier for financial middlemen to peddle opaque, illiquid, and
    high-risk private securities to retail investors who won't receive
    the information they need to make informed investment decisions,'
    she said." \[Congressional Quarterly,
