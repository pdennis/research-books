# Fiduciary Rule

### Prevent The Fiduciary Rule

**2017: Fitzpatrick Voted For Legislation That Would Have Repealed
Significant Portions Of Dodd-Frank, Including The Fiduciary Rule.** In
June 2017, Fitzpatrick voted for the Financial Choice Act. According to
NPR, "House Republicans voted Thursday to deliver on their promise to
repeal Dodd-Frank --- the massive set of Wall Street regulations
President Barack Obama signed into law after the 2008 financial crisis.
In a near party-line vote, the House approved a bill, dubbed the
Financial Choice Act, which scales back or eliminates many of the
post-crisis banking rules." The vote was on passage. The House passed
the bill by a vote of 233 to 186. The Senate took no substantive action
on the legislation. \[House Vote 299,

-   **Legislation Repealed The Fiduciary Rule.** According to the Los
    Angeles Times, "The bill also would repeal a new Labor Department
    regulation, largely still pending, that requires investment brokers
    who handle retirement funds to put their clients' interests ahead of
    their own compensation, company profits or other factors." \[Los
