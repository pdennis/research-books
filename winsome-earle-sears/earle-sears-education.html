<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Earle-Sears staunchly supported education policies that would divert funds from Virginia’s public schools toward private and charter schools. Earle-Sears claimed public school districts were “redlining” and contended the Brown v. Board of Education decision was not about desegregation but instead about parental choice in which citizens could send their children to a school of their choosing. Experts on Brown v. Board found that Earle-Sears’ characterization of the landmark case was inaccurate.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Earle-Sears Took Aim At Virginia Teachers, Accusing Them Of Indoctrinating Children With Critical Race Theory, Marxism And “Family Destroying Propaganda”</strong></h2>
<p><strong>In Her 2023 Memoir, Earle-Sears Accused Virginia Teachers Of “Dividing The Children,” “Condemning Their Parents And Relatives,” And Claimed Children Were “Being Taught Hate.” </strong>In her 2023 memoir “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream,” Winsome Earle-Sears wrote, “How was having a mom and a dad in the home something called ‘White privilege’?&nbsp;How did having been in our country's military make somebody an oppressor?&nbsp;Activist teachers were dividing the children, condemning their parents and relatives. What did any of this&nbsp;have to do with history? With English? With math? Many kids were asking their parents why White people were&nbsp;so bad. And this included themselves or their friends who were White. They were being taught hate. Black children were taught they were victims.” [Earle-Sears, Winsome. “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream.” Center Street, 8/1/23]&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>In Her Memoir, Earle-Sears Suggested Virginia’s Schools And Teachers Were Engaged In A Marxist Project To Take Over Society&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>In Her 2023 Memoir, Earle-Sears Claimed That Teachers In Virginia Were Teaching Students To Hate White And Heterosexual People, And Painted Virginia’s Teachers As Being Engaged In A “Marxist” Project To Take Over Society. </strong>In her 2023 memoir “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream,” Winsome Earle-Sears wrote, “If you're White, you're privileged? If you're heterosexual-they call it cisgender-you're privileged? If you're&nbsp;married to somebody of the opposite sex, that's privilege?! They say we must teach these things to all our children. That that's what education is for, in fact.&nbsp;No. This is teaching everyone to hate. It's fomenting chaos. And who will step in as the savior? The Marxists.&nbsp;Who wants to live under Marxism? We've seen the kind of police states and despotic regimes Marxists create in&nbsp;this world.&nbsp;These are the folks who call wrong right. Up is called down. Two plus two equals whatever you want it to&nbsp;equal. Everything, especially the education of the young, is in service to this power-mad ideology.&nbsp;No. This is America. We're not doing that.&nbsp;Education is where the rubber meets the road. These parents who observed what was going on and spoke out&nbsp;were the alarm bells, the sirens, of free society.&nbsp;They said, ‘No! This is my child. I'm not going to stand for it!’&nbsp;You had thousands of parents who had formerly been Democrats come over to the Republican side. You can&nbsp;talk about party loyalty all you want, but when it comes to my child, all bets are off, baby. If my child isn't learning, I don't care if you are Democrat, Republican, Green Party, or Reform Party, we've got problems.&nbsp;Enough of these parents who were Democrats, independent-leaning Democrats, and others were saying no,&nbsp;something's got to change. Many Democrats began to realize that the revolution had started to come for them&nbsp;and their families, too. They may have thought, ‘Hey, I'm safe; I'm a Democrat.’&nbsp;That stopped working.&nbsp;No. You're still White. Or still married. Still believe family is essential and important. You are now the enemy&nbsp;of the system. Parents are the enemy.” [Earle-Sears, Winsome. “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream.” Center Street, 8/1/23]</p>
<p><strong>In Her 2023 Memoir, Earle-Sears Claimed That Virginia Schools And School Boards Were Advancing “Activist Marxism” Under The Guise Of Teaching American History. </strong>In her 2023 memoir “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream,” Winsome Earle-Sears wrote, “Of course the media and Democrats set up a chorus of disdain. Those Republicans are lying. We're not teaching that! There is no critical race theory in the classroom!&nbsp;We found that many school systems had received taxpayer money for CRT instruction and seminars. School&nbsp;boards were not merely going along, they were instigating and cheering this nonsense on. Our own Board of&nbsp;Education had put it on their website that schools should be teaching critical race theory. Books were recommended, curricula advanced. They called this teaching history? How? It's activist Marxism. It creates chaos. It isn't teaching. It's indoctrination. It's the difference between learning how to think for yourself and being told what to think.&nbsp;Power is all that matters in this indoctrination technique-not education, understanding, working together,&nbsp;competition, hope, love, or belief in God. All of that is illusion, in this view. Only power relationships matter.&nbsp;There was always that word, ‘privilege.’ If you are privileged, you have gained power by harming others. You&nbsp;are bad. You are evil. You are to be despised.” [Earle-Sears, Winsome. “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream.” Center Street, 8/1/23]</p>
<h3><strong>Earle-Sears Accused Virginia School Libraries Of Providing Children With Pornography, And Compared LGBTQ Identity In Schools To The Novel “1984”</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Earle-Sears Accused Virginia School Libraries Of Providing Pornography To Their Students</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Earle-Sears Accused Virginia School Libraries Of Providing Pornography To Their Students In Her Memoir: “Pictures Of People Having Sex. Blow Jobs. Penises Erect.” </strong>In her 2023 memoir “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream,” Winsome Earle-Sears wrote, “It was an onslaught of hateful, antidemocratic ideology. It was antihuman and antifamily. In some cases it was just simply disgusting. We discovered that school libraries possessed pornographic books, and teachers&nbsp;were promoting these and other books, these books were nothing less than filth. Not just in high schools,&nbsp;which would be bad enough, but in elementary and middle schools. Pictures of people having sex. Blow jobs.&nbsp;Penises erect. And the language was astonishing. To say these books were unsuitable for children is the under-&nbsp;statement of the century.&nbsp;They were unsuitable for education.&nbsp;Parents came to school board meetings and read from these books, and in one case the reader was stopped by&nbsp;a school board member. It was too pornographic!” [Earle-Sears, Winsome. “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream.” Center Street, 8/1/23]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Earle-Sears Accused Public Schools Of “Advance LGBT Ideology” And Compared Schools To George Orwell’s 1984</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Earle-Sears Said There Were Efforts To “Advance LGBT Ideology” In Schools, And Compared Modern Schools To The Dystopian Novel “1984.” </strong>According to the Christian Post, “Responding to the efforts to advance LGBT ideology and expose children to other concerning content, Sears remarked that ‘it’s 1984’ in American society, referring to the dystopian novel forecasting a tyrannical government that declares war on reality. ‘If we don’t get a grip, we’re going to be living in some kind of dystopian society,’ she warned.&nbsp;&nbsp;Schlapp asked Sears to react to the fact that several public schools in northern Virginia ‘held merit awards from students’ out of a desire for ‘equity.’ She described the situation as part of an effort to ‘dumb down’ education where ‘instead of trying to bring everybody up, we’re just going to bring everybody down.’&nbsp;&nbsp;Sears lamented the state of American education, asserting that ‘by the time a child even goes to college now, 65% of them need remedial education. We’re paying for it twice. We’re paying for it in the public schools [where] they’re not getting [an education] and we’re paying for it when they do go to college or other post-high school ed.’&nbsp;&nbsp;‘America is a superpower, and the only way to maintain that superpower status is to ensure that everybody has a quality education because China is right behind,’ she added. ‘And guess what? They don’t care about that.’” [Christian Post, <a href="https://www.christianpost.com/news/winsome-sears-warns-of-dystopian-society-of-american-education.html"><u>3/3/23</u></a>]</p>
<h2><strong>Earle-Sears Repeatedly Pushed For Legislation That Would Divert Public Education Funds Toward Charter Schools And Private Schools&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Earle-Sears Was A “Long-Time Charter School Advocate” And Argued That Charter Schools Would “Make Public Schools Better”</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Earle-Sears Was A “Long-Time Charter School Advocate.” </strong>According to WVTF, “Lt. Governor Winsome Earle-Sears is backing a pair of conservative school choice bills. But her support isn’t expected to be enough to overcome Democrats’ opposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘We’re talking about our future and we’re not going to stand in the way of a parent who wants better for their child,’ said Earle-Sears.&nbsp;A long-time charter school advocate, the Lt. Governor spoke Wednesday before a crowd of students from a collection of private schools who lobbied legislators in the hopes of new funding from the state.” [WVTF, <a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2024-01-24/lt-governor-earle-sears-pushes-school-choice-bills-that-are-unlikely-to-get-much-democratic-support"><u>1/24/24</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>In Her Memoir, Earle-Sears Passionately Advocated For An Expansion Of Charter Schools In Virginia, Writing “Choice In Education… Will Make The Public Schools Better.” </strong>In her 2023 memoir “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream,” Winsome Earle-Sears wrote, “So why do Virginia Democrats keep denying charter schools when Black children have been failing spectacularly—yet when given the opportunity have flourished? I’m not a Johnny-come-lately to the education process. It’s something that I’ve been involved with for decades. When I ran for lieutenant governor primarily on education I could truthfully say: I know education. When I sat on the State Board of Education, I accepted no excuses. We need to understand why our children aren’t learning. That’s the primary purpose of school: to learn. That’s why their parents are sending them to school. If schools are not going to do it because school boards take positions that destroy families and separate parents from their children, then parents need to be able to make a different decision. We need school choice. We’ve needed it for some time. Choice in education will lift all boats. It will make the public schools better, and it will bring back the true purpose of education. Unfortunately, it is still mostly a dream in the Commonwealth. But the day is coming when parents will make it a reality.” [Earle-Sears, Winsome. “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream.” Center Street, 8/1/23]</p>

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears has offered a faulty analysis of the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision — which banned government-enforced segregation of public schools.&nbsp;‘It was never about sending Black children to white schools,’ Sears, a Republican, said during a Feb. 2 radio interview on WRVA. ‘It was about parents being able to decide where to send their children to school after all.’ […] “Earle-Sears said that Brown v. Board of Education ‘was never about sending Black children to white schools. It was about parents being able to decide where to send their children to school.’&nbsp;&nbsp;Her statement conflicts with the very words of the Supreme Court in ruling that mandated segregation of public schools violates the 14th Amendment granting all citizens equal protection of laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;As SCOTUS wrote in its unanimous decision, ‘We come then to the question presented: does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physical facilities and other ‘tangible’ factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities? We believe that it does.’&nbsp;&nbsp;We rate Earle-Sears’ statement False.” [PolitiFact VA via Virginia Public Media, <a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-02-21/politifact-winsome-earle-sears-brown-v-board-education"><u>2/21/23</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>PolitiFact VA Analysis: Earle-Sears Repeatedly Claimed Brown V. Board Of Education Was About Parental Rights In Choosing Schools, And Not Desegregation, Which “Conflicts With Key Phrasing In The Supreme Court’s Unanimous Ruling.”</strong> According to a PolitiFact analysis published by Virginia Public Media, “For decades, school voucher advocates have argued that Brown v. Board has failed to produce equal education opportunities for children. Academic research has shown that school segregation ramped up after the court-ordered demise of busing in 1991 and that many Black children are once again locked in poorly performing schools.&nbsp;Earle-Sears’ statement goes a step further by saying that the Brown decision was about parental rights in choosing schools and not desegregation. She made similar claims during a September 2022 interview on Fox News. Her statements conflict with key phrasing in the Supreme Court’s unanimous ruling: ‘We come then to the question presented: does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physical facilities and other ‘tangible’ factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities? We believe that it does.’” [PolitiFact VA via Virginia Public Media, <a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-02-21/politifact-winsome-earle-sears-brown-v-board-education"><u>2/21/23</u></a>]</p>

<h2><strong>Earle-Sears Railed Against Student Loan Forgiveness, Writing “It’s Morally Wrong”</strong></h2>
<p><strong>In Her 2023 Memoir, Earle-Sears Opposed Student Loan Forgiveness, Writing “It Makes No Economic Sense. It’s Morally Wrong.” </strong>In her 2023 memoir “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream,” Winsome Earle-Sears wrote, “The government tried to provide remedies on the adjustable rate mortgage debacle, and they came up with&nbsp;crazy rules that often made the situation worse. They forced people to take stupid measures, to behave in a way&nbsp;that makes no sense to anybody, such as to let their mortgages go into default in order to obtain a fixed rate loan.&nbsp;The sort of thing is what would happen with the government bailing out student loans. It won't benefit the&nbsp;poor. In fact, it hurts the worker in trades, the plumbers and electricians and welders. They don't have these&nbsp;loans. They work and pay taxes. It benefits those who don't need it. People who went to college took these loans&nbsp;and understood when they took them that this is what they promised to pay back. It makes no economic sense.&nbsp;It's morally wrong. They're not saving everybody, as they claim. They're bankrupting us. This is what happens&nbsp;when you have government involved in banking on an individual level, calling winners and losers.: [Earle-Sears, Winsome. “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream.” Center Street, 8/1/23]</p>
