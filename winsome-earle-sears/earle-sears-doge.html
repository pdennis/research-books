<h2><strong>Earle-Sears Supported Donald Trump DOGE Firings Of Federal Workers&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Earle-Sears And Her Campaign Were “Fully Embracing” Trump And Advocating For His Policies Amid His Firings Of Federal Workers</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Washington Post Reported Earle-Sears And Her Campaign Were “Fully Embracing” Donald Trump Despite His General Unpopularity In Virginia And His Efforts To Fire Federal Workers Based In Virginia&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><br><strong>Washington Post: Earle-Sears Was “Fully Embracing” Donald Trump Despite His Losses In Virginia’s Presidential Elections And His Efforts To Fire Federal Workers Based In Virginia. </strong>According to the Washington Post, “Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, Gov. Glenn Youngkin and other Virginia Republicans are fully&nbsp;embracing President Donald Trump despite his losses in the state’s elections. In a Virginia election year, it might seem as though the Trump administration’s efforts to slash the&nbsp;federal workforce and gut federal spending would create stiff headwinds for the president’s fellow Republicans who are&nbsp;running for governor. After all, Virginia’s government-dependent economy has the potential to be more disrupted than&nbsp;that of almost any other state, and those targeted civil servants are crucial suburban voters.&nbsp;But Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R) has at least two challengers from the right for the GOP gubernatorial&nbsp;nomination, and all of them are elbowing one another to strike the most pro-Trump pose. Virginia’s competitive&nbsp;statewide elections are widely seen as the first big test of national voter sentiment under the new administration in&nbsp;Washington, so the dynamics here will influence how the political parties approach next year’s congressional&nbsp;midterms. ‘President Donald Trump is fighting tirelessly to protect Americans from out-of-touch policies. Winsome Earle-Sears&nbsp;stands alongside him,’ her campaign posted the day after Trump delivered a starkly partisan address to Congress&nbsp;earlier this month. The statement was accompanied by a video attacking Democratic policies that Earle-Sears called a&nbsp;‘Parade of Horribles.’” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/17/virginia-trump-youngkin-maga-winsome/"><u>3/17/25</u></a>]</p>

<p><strong>A Recording Of Earle-Sears Downplaying Trump’s Cuts To Federal Workforce Drew Criticism From Federal Employee Unions And Veterans. </strong>According to Virginia Mercury, “A newly surfaced recording of Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is drawing sharp criticism from Democrats and federal employee unions, who say her remarks downplaying the impact of recent federal layoffs show a disregard for the thousands of Virginians — many of them veterans — who have lost their jobs under President Donald Trump’s administration’s workforce cuts.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the clip, released last week by the progressive media outlet Meidas Touch, Earle-Sears is heard downplaying concerns from federal workers about job losses tied to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has already axed more than 6,000 veterans and is on track to cut at least 80,000 VA employees nationwide, according to the Associated Press.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recording, which appears to be from a March 13 gathering, Earle-Sears addresses the recent federal layoffs tied to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). &nbsp;&nbsp;‘Now I’m hearing about DOGE and all of that,’ she begins, before quickly shifting to a broader defense of Virginia’s job market. She insists that ‘we don’t want folks to lose their jobs,’ but points to what she says are ‘over 250,000 jobs that we’ve created since we’ve been in office’ as evidence of economic strength.&nbsp;&nbsp;Earle-Sears then pivots to suggest that job loss is a common experience, asking the crowd, ‘How many here have ever lost a job?’ When some respond affirmatively, she continues: ‘Oh, you mean it’s not unusual? It happens to everybody all the time? Okay.’ She concludes by criticizing the media coverage surrounding the layoffs, saying, ‘The media is making it out to be this huge, huge thing. And I don’t understand why.’” [Virginia Mercury, <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/04/04/earle-sears-comments-on-federal-layoffs-spark-outcry-from-unions-veterans/"><u>4/4/25</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Surette Said Earle-Sears’ And Youngkin’s “Virginia Has Jobs” Platform Was Not Enough To Help Fired Federal Workers, Many Of Whom Were Veterans, Specialized Workers, And “They Deserve More Than Lip Service” From Earle-Sears. </strong>According to Virginia Mercury, “Less than a week after the leaked remarks were recorded, Earle-Sears appeared alongside Youngkin at a March 19 event in Richmond where both officials defended the job cuts as part of a larger plan for national economic health.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Today, we know we have a federal government that is facing huge fiscal issues with $37 trillion in debt, with $2 trillion being added every year,’ Youngkin said. ‘What that requires is real action quickly.’&nbsp;&nbsp;Earle-Sears echoed the message, calling Virginia ‘resilient’ and citing CNBC’s ranking of the commonwealth as the top state for business in 2024. Both touted the state’s Virginia Has Jobs platform, which they say lists over 250,000 available positions for displaced workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;But union leaders say those promises don’t match reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘These workers can’t just walk into another job next week,’ said Surette. ‘Many are specialized professionals. Some are still waiting on severance. And in the meantime, veterans are waiting on appointments, prescriptions, and essential services.’&nbsp;&nbsp;Surette added that the disruption goes far beyond temporary economic turbulence, but that it strikes at the heart of the values many federal employees hold. &nbsp;&nbsp;‘These are people who dedicated their lives to serving others … many of them twice, first in uniform and then in federal agencies. They deserve more than lip service. They deserve respect, support, and stability.’” [Virginia Mercury, <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/04/04/earle-sears-comments-on-federal-layoffs-spark-outcry-from-unions-veterans/"><u>4/4/25</u></a>]</li>

She doesn’t want to run afoul of Trump, or Republican activists who are cheering on his job cuts. However, it’s never a good look to seem unconcerned about constituents who are losing their jobs. Surely Republican wordsmiths can come up with some clever language that seems more sympathetic than what she’s recorded saying here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Politically, this is potentially damaging because these words will make it harder for her to tamp down the outrage that Democrats will want to stoke in Northern Virginia. To be fair, this is not quite on the level of Hillary Clinton’s infamous quote about how ‘we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.’ That quote was often cited out of context. In context, she expressed more sympathy toward coal miners, but we also see how negatively coal country voters responded.” [Dwayne Yancey Opinion, Cardinal News, <a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2025/03/31/earle-sears-says-its-not-unusual-to-lose-a-job-so-federal-job-cuts-arent-a-huge-huge-thing/"><u>3/31/25</u></a>]</p>

They often note that the state has 250,000 available jobs, though many of those are mismatches with&nbsp;the skills of federal workers.” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/04/08/spanberger-virginia-governor-race-unions/"><u>4/8/25</u></a>]</li>

<p><strong>February 2025: The Trump Administration Suspended A Federal Scholarship Program Meant To Help Students From Underserved Communities Study Agriculture Or Natural Sciences At HBCUs, Including Virginia State University, Amid An Administration-Wide Dismantling Of “Diversity, Equity, And Inclusion” Related Initiatives.</strong> According to WRIC-RIC (ABC), “HOST 1: ‘And this morning, we know a federal scholarship program meant for HBCU's is now being put on hold.

But as of last week, that program has been suspended. As of Friday, the 1890 National Scholars Program's web page on the USDA's website reads the program has been suspended pending further review. We know the program has been around since 1992, helping students from underserved communities pursue a degree in agriculture, natural resource sciences, or other related fields at an HBCU. The program, which was offered at VSU until being suspended, gave eligible students full tuition, room and board and other funds. It's unclear right now why the program was suspended. However, we do know the Trump administration has been taking steps to modify various diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Now, to find out what other universities have been impacted by this suspension, you can visit our website at WIC.com.

<h3><strong>Virginia's James River Park System See Cuts Under Trump's DOGE&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>February 2025: A Group Working To Conserve The James River Park System Said The Trump Administration’s Cuts Threatened Their Efforts To Ensure Invasive Species Did Not Kill Local Trees And Wreck The Tree Canopy That Defined Their Local Ecosystem. </strong>According to WTVR-RIC (CBS), “HOST 1:&nbsp; ‘And as plans continue to reshape the federal government and how money is spent in DC. A local conservation group is worried about what it could mean for the future of the James River Park system. Our Melissa Hippolyte explains.’&nbsp; HOST 2: ‘The friends of the James River Park system received tens of thousands of dollars in federal grant money to help them remove invasive plants like this one. That funding could be in jeopardy. In a place where most people go to escape it all. Strong winds of change are afloat. Blowing in from Washington.’&nbsp; JOSH STUTZ: ‘A little disappointing’&nbsp; HOST 2: ‘after President Donald Trump tasked his Department of Government efficiency with reducing federal spending. Local efforts to remove invasive plants harming the James River Park system may be impacted.’&nbsp; JOSH STUTZ:&nbsp; ‘They compete with the native plants that live here, and they eventually, in the case of English ivy, work to choke off the tree canopy. So they kill the the local trees, the native trees that we love so much that make up our our natural forests around the river. And if we don't manage the invasive plant problem right now, we will we will firmly lose huge chunks of our tree canopy in about 15 or 20 years.’&nbsp; HOST 2:&nbsp; ‘Josh Stutz, who heads up friends of the James River Park System, says his nonprofit has volunteers to clear the invasive plants. But the work is endless and a federal grant is allowing them to pay folks to help.’&nbsp; JOSH STUTZ:&nbsp; ‘Because they're very technical, very they're really well trained and have skills that volunteers don't necessarily have. And we can guarantee their work on a weekly basis.’&nbsp; HOST 2:&nbsp; ‘Two pieces of legislation passed by Congress under the Biden administration, the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law allowed friends of the James River Park to apply for and receive about $350,000 in federal grant money. The money is being used to hire people to remove invasive plant species and work with a consultant to build a long term management plan for the park.’&nbsp; JOSH STUTZ: ‘You know, you go into this with the best of intentions and with those the full faith and credit of the federal government, you believe that that's going to be backing this grant and you invest in people and projects and get things up and moving and you start to build a culture and build systems and to find out that it can so quickly be taken away.’&nbsp; HOST 2:&nbsp; ‘Stutz says the way the grants work is the nonprofit will pay for the work out of its own pocket and then apply for reimbursement through the State Department of Forestry, which administers the grants. The state will then verify the work that was done and release the money back to friends of the James River Park.’&nbsp; JOSH STUTZ: ‘Now we have these staff that as of Friday, we've been asked to cease all work related to those grants. And to that end, we were told as well that the reimbursements for the last quarter would be on hold until further notice as well.’&nbsp; HOST 2:&nbsp; ‘He says his team will do everything they can to make it work, but he wants folks to know about the local impact of what's happening in D.C.’&nbsp; JOSH STUTZ: ‘We're just trying to make a better James River Park system.’&nbsp; HOST 2:&nbsp; ‘James Stutz told me the friends of the James River Park is committed to keeping its invasive plant removal staff to do that.

<p><strong>March 2025: Trump’s Federal Funding Cuts Impacted Jobs In Higher Education Outside The Government, Including In A Nonprofit That Helped Students Obtain Scholarships. </strong>According to WRIC-RIC (ABC), “HOST 1:&nbsp; ‘President Trump's federal funding freeze is now impacting higher education jobs outside of the federal government. This time, a nonprofit organization announcing some of its employees that handle student scholarships will be furloughed. Eight News reporter Jamal Williams joining us live in Richmond. And Jamal, how does this impact student employees in situations like this?’&nbsp; HOST 2:&nbsp; ‘Well, Eric, I reported last week that some college students could be in danger of losing their scholarship programs like Fulbright, Humphrey and Gilman. Now reporting now that some of the employees of those education and cultural welfare programs will be losing their jobs. Well, some of them will be losing their jobs until further notice. Now, on Friday, the announcement came from the Institute of International Education, or IIE, which oversees those programs. It stated numerous factors, such as delays in payment processing, have limited the institute's ability to retain full staffing levels. The nonprofit says it remains hopeful that this will be a temporary change. However, VCU student and former Gilman scholarship recipient Nonso Akunwafor says the money helped him study abroad in Granada, Spain last year. And he says downsizing a program aimed at serving students in need sends a bad message.’&nbsp; NONSO AKUNWAFOR:&nbsp; ‘If you're rich, if you're wealthy, if you come from a background where you can take breaks and study and study abroad or go abroad, then you are the one who deserves the right to that experience. When you got here, I think that traveling, nobility, learning more about other cultures should be an opportunity as afforded to all students, not just people who have the means to do that.’&nbsp; HOST 2:&nbsp; ‘IIE said it's working with partners and grantees to try to navigate these circumstances. However, I tried to reach out to them about specifics on what these furloughs mean, but haven't heard back yet. Live in Richmond, Jamal Williams, 8 News.

<h3><strong>Trump Cuts To Department Of Education Hurts Virginia Schools</strong></h3>
<p><strong>March 2025: Virginia K-12 Schools Got Nearly 11% Of Funding From The Federal Government And Were Expected To Feel The Impact Of Trump’s Cuts To Education Funds. </strong>According to WRIC-RIC (ABC), “HOST 1: ‘Welcome back.

But now 130 of its employees have been fired. And that workload could be too much for who's left.
