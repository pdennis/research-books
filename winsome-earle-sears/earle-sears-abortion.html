<h3><strong>Earle-Sears Vehemently Opposed Abortion And Her Opposition To Abortion Appeared To Be Foundational To Her Republican Identity</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>Earle-Sears “Firmly” Opposed Abortion</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>WTOP Described Earle-Sears As “A Staunch Conservative” Who Was “Firmly Against Abortion.” </strong>According to WTOP, “While Earle-Sears is the likely Republican nominee, Rep. Abigail Spanberger is the likely Democratic nominee, and the two have polar opposite views when it comes to abortion.&nbsp; For example, Spanberger supports a proposed amendment being considered by state lawmakers that seeks to codify abortion rights in the Virginia constitution.&nbsp; Earle-Sears, a staunch conservative who speaks frequently about her Christian faith, is firmly against abortion. ‘Does Abigail have a limit, or is it that you can have an abortion right up until the time the baby could be born?’ Earle-Sears asked. ‘That’s what I would like to know from her.’” [WTOP,<a href="https://wtop.com/local-politics-elections-news/2024/11/virginias-likely-republican-nominee-for-governor-reflects-on-her-priorities-re-entry-into-politics/"><u> 11/26/24</u></a>]</p>

<h4><strong><u>In Her Memoir, Earle-Sears Wrote That She Realized She Was A Republican After Hearing George H.W. Bush Campaign Against Abortion&nbsp;</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>In Her 2023 Memoir, Earle-Sears Wrote That She Realized She Was A Republican After Hearing George H.W. Bush Say He Would “Reduce Abortion.” </strong>In her 2023 memoir “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream,” Winsome Earle-Sears wrote, “It was the political season leading up to the national election of 1988. Television was filled with political commercials. I was watching one after another as I cared for the kids. Michael Dukakis in his commercial said he was going to expand abortion, that he was going to increase taxes. Furthermore, he was going to expand the government welfare program and other government programs. I thought: Wait. Wait one minute here. I don’t believe in any of that. Then right behind Dukakis, Bush aired his commercials. ‘I will reduce abortion.’ Now that sat well with me because I’d just had my baby three months prior. Bush went on to say, ‘I’m going to reduce your taxes.’ I thought, that’s excellent, I’m cheap! Well, the kids call me cheap. I like to think of it as frugal. Reduce my taxes! Then he said something that blew my mind, and it was the political turning point of my life. I’ll never forget it. ‘If all you ever have is welfare, you will never have anything to pass on to your children.’ […] I said to myself, ‘Oh, my God. I’m a Republican.’” [Earle-Sears, Winsome. “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream.” Center Street, 8/1/23]&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>In Her Memoir, Earle-Sears Said That Her Opposition To Abortion Contributed To Her Decision To Run For U.S. Congress In 2004</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>In Her 2023 Memoir, Earle-Sears Wrote In Her Memoir That Rep. Bobby Scott’s Vote Against A Law That Blocked Interstate Travel For Abortion Motivating Factor In Her Decision To Run For Congress Against Him In 2004. </strong>In her 2023 memoir “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream,” Winsome Earle-Sears wrote, “Running for U.S. Congress was not my idea. I said no at first. I told them I was done with politics and my&nbsp;daughters needed me. But then I was confronted with the votes that my eventual opponent had taken over the&nbsp;years. One that stood out was Bobby Scott's vote against the Child Custody Protection Act.1 The law would have&nbsp;prohibited an individual from taking somebody else's underage daughter across state lines to get an abortion. It&nbsp;could be your daughter. It could be mine. Such a person could then just drop her back home as if nothing had&nbsp;happened. And of course we know that a lot of underage girls are sexually trafficked by much older men. They're&nbsp;not prosecuted if they take a girl in for an abortion.” [Earle-Sears, Winsome. “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream.” Center Street, 8/1/23]&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>In 2021, Earle-Sears Told The Daily Press: “I Will Continue To Fight To Protect The Life Of The Baby In The Womb”</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2021: Earle-Sears Said: “I Will Continue To Fight To Protect The Life Of The Baby In The Womb.” </strong>Asked in a Daily Press Q&amp;A “Is there a particular gubernatorial candidate you're campaigning with or you want to see win? How would you handle the job if another candidate or a Democrat won?” Winsome Earle-Sears responded, “I have been endorsed by three 2021 Gubernatorial candidates; however, I have chosen to run my own race and focus on the important issues that voters request of their next Lieutenant Governor. I'm looking forward to working with whomever Conservatives choose as our next nominee. I will continue to fight to protect the life of the baby in the womb and our Second Amendment right held by the voters who will have chosen to put me in office.” [Winsome Earle-Sears – Daily Press Q&amp;A, <a href="https://www.dailypress.com/2021/05/07/the-6-republicans-competing-to-be-virginias-lieutenant-governor-in-their-own-words/"><u>5/7/21</u></a>]</p>
<h4><strong><u>In 2004, Earle-Sears Said “Life Begins At Conception, And I Will Not Support Abortion”</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2004: Earle-Sears Said “Life Begins At Conception, And I Will Not Support Abortion” At A Debate With Her Democratic Opponent For U.S. Congress. </strong>According to the Virginian-Pilot, “With six weeks remaining before the Nov. 2 election, the candidates outlined their differences during their second debate, which was held at The Dwelling Place, a Christian center that serves college-age students.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sears, a Republican and former state delegate, repeatedly attacked Scott for not standing up for the district and instead toeing his party's line.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘My opponent has voted against you,’ she said to the crowd of more than 400.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sears hammered away at the Democratic incumbent on a number of issues, including taxes, Iraq, abortion and same-sex marriages. […] Sears said she opposes abortion. ‘Life begins at conception, and I will not support abortion,’ she said. Scott favors a woman's right to choose.” [Virginian-Pilot, 9/21/04]</p>
<h4><strong><u>In 2001, Earle-Sears Wrote That The Constitution “Guarantees Each Of Us The Right To Life”</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2001: Earle-Sears Wrote “Our Constitution Guarantees Each Of Us The Right To Life” In Response To A Candidate Q&amp;A. </strong>Asked by the Virginian-Pilot “should Virginia change its restrictions on abortion? How? Or why not?” Winsome Earle-Sears replied, “Our constitution guarantees each of us the right to life. To be more explicit, life comes from God. Too many babies will never see their lives fulfilled. If a mind is a terrible thing to waste, then how much more so a life?” [Winsome Earle-Sears – Virginian-Pilot Q&amp;A, 10/29/01]</p>
<h4><strong><u>Earle-Sears Said She Was A “Republican In Large Part” Because She Opposed Abortion</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2001: Earle-Sears Said In An Endorsement Interview With The Virginian-Pilot Editorial Board That She Was A “Republican In Large Part” Because She Opposed Abortion.</strong> According to an opinion from the Virginian-Pilot Editorial Board, “There are several reasons not to re-elect William P. ‘Billy’ Robinson in the 90th House District, as well as several reasons to vote for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, we endorsed an independent over him. This year, if his Republican opponent, political neophyte Winsome E. Sears, were qualified, we'd endorse her in a heartbeat. But she's not.&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be argued that Sears is more likely to grow in office than Robinson is to stop missing court dates - though a recent night in jail for still another missed date may have captured his attention. Small fines for previous failures never did.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also been late paying taxes in the past, and Robinson has repeatedly abused legislative privilege to delay hearings and trials. That's a sorry record.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sears, 37, is a former director of the Salvation Army's homeless shelter in Chesapeake. She is a graduate student at Regent University.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing she said in an endorsement interview was, ‘I am a Christian before I am a Republican.’ She is a Republican in large part because she opposes abortion. Also, she believes the Republican Party ‘empowers’ people, while Democrats make them dependent on government.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her understanding of state government is limited, her recommendations general and vague. For example, she favors cutting out duplication to gain more money for education. Who wouldn't? But where's the duplication?” [Editorial Board Opinion – The Virginian-Pilot, 11/2/01]&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Wall Street Journal Opinion Highlighted That Earle-Sears Credited Michael Dukakis’ Presidential Campaign For Her Decision To Become A Republican As She Was Under The Impression He Campaigned On “How The Right Of Abortion Couldn't Be Restricted In Any Way, Shape Or Form.”</strong> According to a John Fund opinion from the Wall Street Journal, “She credits her conversion to the Republican Party to the candidacy of Michael Dukakis for president. ‘He would talk about how only government could help the downtrodden lift themselves up and how the right of abortion couldn't be restricted in any way, shape or form,’ she recalls. ‘I just knew then that I had been a lazy Democrat and I never looked back. I became a Republican.’” [John Fund Opinion – Wall Street Journal, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122418861299142045"><u>11/8/01</u></a>]&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2024: At An Anti-Abortion Rally, Earle-Sears Said “Let’s Pray That Our Legislators Will Change And The Laws Will Change.” </strong>According to the Associated Press, “Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, both Republicans, joined thousands of Virginia activists Wednesday for an annual anti-abortion demonstration, where attendees denounced Democratic lawmakers who have blocked proposed restrictions since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;&nbsp;Earle-Sears, who addressed a rally just outside the Capitol before attendees marched through downtown Richmond, joined other speakers in calling for housing, support and other resources for expectant parents. She also expressed compassion for women who have had abortions and exhorted attendees to keep up their advocacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Let’s pray that hearts will be changed. Let’s pray that our legislators will change and the laws will change,’ said Earle-Sears, whose voice broke with emotion at the start of her remarks.” [Associated Press, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virginia-abortion-protests-glenn-youngkin-edf65ed4610f256344dd9c8571e674d8"><u>2/21/24</u></a>]</p>

<p><strong>June 28, 2022: In An Interview With</strong> <strong>Virginia Capitol Bureau Reporter Jackie DeFusco, Earle-Sears “Expressed Support For A Ban On Most Abortion After 15 Weeks.” </strong>According to WRIC ABC 8News, “In a politically divided General Assembly, Lt. Governor Winsome Earle-Sears could be the tie-breaking vote on abortion policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sears sat down with Virginia Capitol Bureau Reporter Jackie DeFusco to discuss her views on Tuesday. She expressed support for a ban on most abortion after 15 weeks but was less clear about other issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that Roe v. Wade has been struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court, abortion rights will be decided by each state. Access in Virginia will not be immediately impacted by the ruling but that could change down the road if Republicans get their way. ‘I believe the baby in the womb wants to live. Now we have to make sure that we take care of the life and the health of the mother and, of course, rape and incest. But at the same time, I thought, this is excellent. We get an opportunity to talk about this some more,’ Sears said.” [WRIC ABC 8News, <a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/watch-live-lt-gov-winsome-earle-sears-on-abortion-rights-in-virginia/"><u>6/28/22</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>Earle-Sears Said She Agreed With Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Proposal To Ban Abortion After 15 Weeks. </strong>According to WRIC ABC 8News, “Last week, Gov. Glenn Youngkin said he would support a bill banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Some argue that’s when a fetus can feel pain, though that’s contested.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked how many weeks into a pregnancy she thinks abortion should be banned, Sears said, ‘Well, the Governor has said that he’s putting forward 15 weeks.

  <li><strong>Earle-Sears Declined To Walk Back Her Earlier Support For A Six-Week Abortion Ban, But Called For A 15-Week Abortion Ban In The Mean Time.</strong> According to WRIC ABC 8News, “During her campaign, Sears said in an interview with Newsmax that she would support an abortion ban once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, usually around six weeks into pregnancy. This would be similar to the law that took effect in Texas last fall. She didn’t give a direct answer to the same question in a subsequent interview before the election.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked on Tuesday if she is walking back that position, Sears said, ‘I’m not sure that I’m walking that back. I’m just saying 15 weeks. Let’s do the 15 weeks.’ Asked if she would support a more restrictive ban if Republicans had the votes down the road, as some anti-abortion groups have called for, Sears said, ‘I don’t know if they will or won’t. What I’m telling you is 15 weeks.’” [WRIC ABC 8News, <a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/watch-live-lt-gov-winsome-earle-sears-on-abortion-rights-in-virginia/"><u>6/28/22</u></a>]</li>
