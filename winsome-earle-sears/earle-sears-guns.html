<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Earle-Sears opposed red flag laws and called for enhanced gun rights as a way to address gun violence. After a mass shooting in Richmond in June 2023, Earle-Sears blamed the mass shooting on local officials and gang violence. Days after the Uvalde shooting in May 2022, Earle-Sears attended an NRA event and claimed mass shootings were attributed to societal “ills,” including lack of prayer in schools, “emasculated” men, abortion, mental illness, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Earle-Sears Opposed Red-Flag Laws And Blamed Gun Violence And Mass Shootings On Local Officials And Societal “Ills,” Such As Lack Of Prayer In Schools, “Emasculated” Men, Abortion, Mental Illness, And More</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>In June 2023, After A Mass Shooting In Richmond, Earle-Sears Blamed Local Officials And Gang Violence</strong></h3>
<p><strong>June 2023: After A Mass Shooting Following A High School Graduation In Richmond, Earle-Sears Blamed Local Officials And Gang Violence: “If All We Do Is Come In Front Of A Camera… And Keep Talking About, ‘Oh, This Shouldn’t Happen, And That Shouldn’t Happen.’ Well, You’re The One In Charge. You’re The One Responsible.”</strong> According to Dogwood, “Two people were killed and several others were injured in a mass shooting following Huguenot High School’s graduation ceremony on Tuesday evening near Richmond’s Altria Theater.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two victims have been identified as a Huguenot graduate and his stepfather. […] Virginia Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, who briefly represented part of Hampton Roads in the state House about 20 years ago, arrived at the scene of the Richmond tragedy to comment on the shooting. Earle-Sears, a military veteran who became notorious for a campaign poster featuring her brandishing an assault-style rifle, assigned blame for the violence to local Democratic officials and gang violence – but not guns.&nbsp;&nbsp;Claiming that Richmonders are ‘not safe in this city,’ Earle-Sears wondered: ‘Who is in charge – is that the mayor, is that the chief, who is that? I mean, let’s start naming names. Because otherwise, if no one is accountable, if all we do is come in front of a camera… and keep talking about, ‘oh, this shouldn’t happen, and that shouldn’t happen.’ Well, you’re the one in charge. You’re the one responsible.’&nbsp;&nbsp;‘This is not about law-abiding gun owners, this is about gangs,’ she further claimed.” [Dogwood, <a href="https://vadogwood.com/2023/06/07/following-richmond-mass-shooting-virginias-lt-governor-blames-everything-but-guns/"><u>6/7/23</u></a>]&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>June 2023: After A Briefing On The Mass Shooting, Earle-Sears Said, “This Is Not About Law-Abiding Gun Owners. This Is About Gangs… The Others Who Mean Harm, Who Mean To Kill And Mayhem, They’re Going To Have The Guns.”</strong> According to WRIC ABC 8News, “Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R) addressed the crowd of reporters after the briefing ended, calling out city leaders and pointing to ‘gangs’ in remarks that Democrats said inserted politics into a tragedy before any details on the investigation were released.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I was told to stay away but the people that I represent are not safe. They’re not safe in this city and we have to figure out why that is. This is not about law-abiding gun owners. This is about gangs,’ Earle-Sears said. ‘This is about even if you took all the guns off the street from the law-abiding citizens, the others who mean harm, who mean to kill and mayhem, they’re going to have the guns.’” [WRIC ABC 8News, <a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/virginia-democrats-decry-lt-gov-winsome-earle-sears-remarks-on-richmond-mass-shooting/"><u>6/7/23</u></a>]</p>

Even language has deteriorated, she said, ‘such that F-bombs&nbsp;and even the startling MF bombs are spoken across our airways.’&nbsp;These and other ills are plaguing the nation, she said, ‘Because we took prayer out of schools.

A grown daughter of hers with bipolar disorder — off her medication and driving at what police&nbsp;described as ‘an excessive rate of speed’ — died in a car wreck in 2012 that also killed Earle-Sears’s two young&nbsp;granddaughters. ‘We are told that guns are the problem but … a determined mentally unstable person will try to find other means to their wicked deed — whether with a car, molotov cocktail, or some other means,’ she said.” [Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/05/27/winsome-earl-sears-nra-uvalde/"><u>5/27/22</u></a>]</p>

  <li><strong>2023: Earle-Sears Described The Origin Of The Assault Rifle Photo In Her Memoir, And Said The Photo Went Viral Because It Was “Powerful, A Black Woman Standing With A Gun Like That.” In her 2023 memoir “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream,” Winsome Earle-Sears wrote, “During the cycle, we were on our way to a GOP meeting when we passed a rifle range.&nbsp;It had been a while since I'd been at the range.&nbsp;So we stopped by Clark Brothers Range in Warrenton, Virginia. I put on a green coat to keep the spent gun-&nbsp;power blowback off my blouse.&nbsp;When you look at the photo taken there, you can see that I still have my earplugs in. Nothing staged there.&nbsp;The picture took off. It went viral.&nbsp;It's not as if an AR is unknown to me. In the Marines I had an M-16. I had to break the thing down and put it&nbsp;back together. There's a photo of me with my M-16 in full battle dress, my helmet, my camouflage, my flak jacket,&nbsp;my extra magazines, everything. I look ready to go, because I was. We were engaging in a war game at the time.&nbsp;So standing with that AR was normal and natural for me.&nbsp;I think it's pretty powerful, a Black woman standing with a gun like that.” [Earle-Sears, Winsome. “How Sweet It Is: Defending the American Dream.” Center Street, 8/1/23]</strong></li>
